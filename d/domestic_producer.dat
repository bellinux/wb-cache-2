5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because {{of the cost of}} importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival <b>domestic</b> <b>producer,</b> Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E

[...] Similarly, a U.S. company selling a car domestically will be charged a sales tax as will the German manufacturer attempting to sell in the U.S. [...] However, if Germany did not remit the VAT on export, the German producer would be charged both the sales tax and the VAT tax, thus facing a price distortion.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} product development and innovation of Chinese <b>domestic</b> mobile phone <b>producers</b> from a 'Sectoral Systems of Innovation' approach. It {{concentrates on the}} impacts of institution and nature of knowledge on the innovation process. Empirically, this thesis examines institutional frameworks imposed by the Chinese government and their impacts on the innovation process. It also studies strategies of the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> to launch and innovate their products, and {{the relations between the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> and different actors such as component producers and technology providers. Documentary- and interview-based data demonstrates that the Chinese government has manipulated institutional framework for the purpose of encouraging learning and growth of the domestic industry. However, it has been difficult to achieve these aims in short term because the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> have to adapt to the fast-moving technologies and ever-changing demand in the market. Currently, leading <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> are 'walking on two legs' : they launch products by cooperating with foreign mobile phone producers to adapt to the market on one hand, and develop their own products to acquire knowledge and technology gradually on the other. They concentrate on acquiring some layers of the technologies within their competence, while relying on outsides firms for most core technologies. Moreover, they mainly innovate in appearance and applications of the products where they have to utilize their knowledge of customer's demand. It is possible for the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> to concentrate on part of the product because they can access the modular core technologies through collaboration with the specialized actors which emerge as a result of vertical disintegration and specialization of the mobile phone industry in recent years...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of {{heterogeneity}} of foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> on product standard and investigate whether the standard chosen by the welfare-maximizing policymaker is protectionist. In a partial-equilibrium set-up, both <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>producers</b> compete in selling a product in the domestic market, {{in the presence of}} consumption externalities. The policymaker chooses a minimum domestic standard that has to be met by both <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>producers.</b> Protectionism occurs when the welfare-maximizing domestic standard is higher than the international standard maximizing welfare inclusive of foreign profits. We show that the standard is anti-protectionist when foreign producers are much more efficient at addressing the externality than are <b>domestic</b> <b>producers.</b> Possible exclusion of <b>domestic</b> or foreign <b>producers</b> arises with large standards, which may alter the classification of a standard as protectionist or non-protectionist.
