40|$|We present new {{attacks against}} the EMV <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> <b>security</b> system (known in Europe as “Chip and PIN”), {{specifically}} on the back-end API support for sending secure messages to EMV smartcards. We examine how secure messaging is implemented in two major Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). We show how to inject chosen plaintext into encrypted traffic between HSM and smartcard. In the case of IBM’s implementation, we further show how to retrieve confidential data from within messages by combining the injection ability with a partial dictionary attack. Such attacks could compromise secret key update of a banking smartcard, permitting construction of a perfect counterfeit, or could change the card’s PIN to a value chosen by the adversary. We discuss the issues underlying such security holes: the unwieldy primitive of cipher block chaining (CBC) has much to answer for, as does an ever-present tension between defining API functionality too specifically or too generically. We {{stress the importance of}} using secure primitives when designing security APIs, particularly because their functionality so closely resembles the theoretical adversarial model of Oracle-access. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses a Sociological {{approach to}} analyse {{the risks associated}} with the practice of securities lending. Risks are those factors that inhibit the development of trust, and trust is essential for people to participate in <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> like <b>securities</b> lending. In this dissertation we show that, although {{there are a number of}} risks, individual and systemic, that are associated with securities lending, practitioners have, over time, developed an array of risk management procedures and practices to keep these risks at acceptable levels. Securities lending is however not practiced in a vacuum and the relevance of these risk management procedures is largely determined by the cultural environment in which it is practised. Values, norms and sanctions are crucial as social controls over behaviour that transpires in social structures. The presence of structural conditions necessary for the development of a culture of extreme opportunism is shown as arguably the greatest source of risk facing those who participate in <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> like <b>securities</b> lending.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} <b>transaction</b> taxes on <b>financial</b> markets {{in the context of}} four questions. How important is trading? What causes price volatility? How are prices formed? How valuable is the volume of transactions? Drawing on the literature on market microstructure, asset pricing, rational expectations, and international finance, we argue that <b>securities</b> <b>transaction</b> taxes “throw sand ” not in the wheels, but into the engine of financial markets. We conclude that transaction taxes can have negative effects on price discovery, volatility, and liquidity and lead to a reduction in the informational efficiency of markets. JEL G 13, G 14, H 10 This paper argues that transaction taxes can have negative effects on price discovery, volatility, and market liquidity in securities markets.

40|$|Abstract. The Learning with Errors (LWE) {{problem has}} gained a lot of {{attention}} in recent years leading to a series of new cryptographic applications. Specifically, it states {{that it is hard to}} distinguish random linear equations disguised by some small error from truly random ones. Interestingly, cryptographic primitives based on LWE often do not exploit the full potential of the error term beside of its importance for security. To this end, we introduce a novel LWE-close assumption, namely Augmented Learning with Errors (A-LWE), which allows to hide auxiliary data injected into the error term by a technique that we call message embedding. In particular, it enables existing cryptosystems to strongly increase the message throughput per ciphertext. We show that A-LWE is for certain instantiations at least as hard as the LWE problem. This inherently leads to new cryptographic constructions providing high data load encryption and customized security properties as required, for instance, in economic environments such as stock markets resp. for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> The <b>security</b> of those constructions basically stems from the hardness to solve the A-LWE problem. As an application we introduce (among others) the first lattice-based replayable chosen-ciphertext secure encryption scheme from A-LWE...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the importance of ethics applied to everyday moral problems arising from the use of e-banking services. These services have advantages in <b>financial</b> <b>transactions,</b> but <b>security</b> threats and vulnerabilities must be constantly reduced. In this framework raises the 'good citizen' that desires to do well and needs to avoid harmful behavior [1]. While the 'bad citizen' promotes the lack of transparency, wrong attitudes and 'hidden' awareness of the nature, level and scope of the financial impact which claims to reduce the social responsibility [2] and produces high level of degree of materialistic values were less likely to acquire moral [3]. Indeed, the integration of fraud on all aspects of the e-banking services requires the profound revision of the traditional commercial paradigms that have been prevailed for last years. Thus, on the one hand, the theoretical framework of this paper is based on literature about ethics and fraud, in general, and information and communication technology of the e-banking services, in particular. On the other hand, the empirical framework reflects the practices in this field of research used by banks with public data available on the Portuguese Banking Association. The results of the paper show several threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, impacts and response that face e-banking services. To mitigate these risks, the main challenge is the public discussion that will promote prevention and disclosure evidence-based incidents, not only to endorse an adequate behavior but, also, to develop guidance on practical evidence on ethics and reduce fraud...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a secure {{electronic}} voting protocol that {{is suitable for}} large scale voting over the Internet. The protocol allows a voter to cast his or her ballot anonymously, by exchanging untraceable yet authentic messages. The protocol ensures that (i) only eligible voters are able to cast votes, (ii) a voter is able to cast only one vote, (iii) a voter is able to verify {{that his or her}} vote is counted in the final tally, (iv) nobody, other than the voter, is able to link a cast vote with a voter, and (v) if a voter decides not to cast a vote, nobody is able to cast a fraudulent vote in place of the voter. The protocol does not require the cooperation of all registered voters. Neither does it require the use of complex cryptographic techniques like threshold cryptosystems or anonymous channels for casting votes. This is in contrast to other voting protocols that have been proposed in the literature. The protocol uses three agents, other than the voters, for successful operation. However, we do not require any of these agents to be trusted. That is, the agents may be physically co-located or may collude with one another to try to commit a fraud. If a fraud is committed, it can be easily detected and proven, so that the vote can be declared null and void. Although we propose the protocol with electronic voting in mind, the protocol can be used in other applications that involve exchanging an untraceable yet authentic message. Examples of such applications are answering confidential questionnaire anonymously or anonymous <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Keywords: <b>Security,</b> Voting, Auction, Protocols, Internet Contact Address: Dr. Indrajit Ray Department of Computer and Information Science University of Michigan-Dearborn Dearborn, MI 48188 Phone: (313) 593 - 1793 [...] ...|$|R

Background and Problem Discussion: There are challenges associated with overly cash based societies. The use of mobile financial systems could {{address some of}} these challenges. Understanding {{the factors that influence}} people’s willingness to use mobile systems for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> could be significant in developing strategies to transition from traditional payment systems to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> systems. Purpose – The purpose of this is to assess contribution of customer trust and perception of customer focus to the willingness of GSM subscribers to use the mobile system for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> and how the understanding derived from these factors can be used to develop strategies to promote a transition from cashed based society to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Method- Quantitative and deductive approach was used. 300 GSM respondents who were selected with a multistage sampling method in three locations were surveyed. Interviewers were used to get data on perceived customer focus level, customer trust and willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Theory – Theory section looks at the concepts relating to customer trust and customer perception of customer focus and pertinent subconstructs applicable to the engagement in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Analysis – I have used correlational analysis to verify the level of association between customer trust, customer focus perception, socio demographic factors and the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> In order to verify the influence of income, a non parametric test was done.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, the movement advocating for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax gained considerable support, culminating in the presentation of a proposal for such a tax by the European Commission on September 28, 2011. This thesis researches and analyzes the use of a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax in light of the stated purpose of the Commission’s proposal. The primary goals of the tax are to (1) raise revenue, (2) curb excessive volatility, and (3) harmonize the internal market. Taxes are most commonly implemented for their revenue-raising qualities rather than as tools for remedying market distortions. In contrast, many view the primary function of the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as a regulatory tool to minimize excessive risk taking in financial markets. Although this thesis will analyze the potential effects on revenue and the tax’s ability to contribute to harmonization of the internal market, the primary focus is on the volatility-reducing effect regulatory authorities can expect from implementing such a tax. Although the thesis will use the European Commission proposal for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as its starting point, it will also review other variations on the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis will also present alternative measures that should be considered for achieving the goals set forth by the European Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax, and evaluate these measures in light of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis concludes that while a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction,</b> in theory, may seem like a dynamic solution that could accomplish several different goals, a multifaceted approach tailored to each individual issue is likely to create a more strategic solution in the long run. A more narrowly tailored strategy is also less likely to negatively affect GDP and trading patterns than a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax...|$|R
