40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to examine the most common errors in the {{national}} test and whether the students make the same errors in <b>English</b> course <b>B</b> as in <b>English</b> course A at Upper Secondary School in Sweden. The method {{used for this study}} is quantitative where nine grammatical features are used to count the errors made. Twenty national tests were used to carry out this study; ten national tests are from English course A and the other ten from <b>English</b> course <b>B.</b> Results from all features from English course A are compared with some features from <b>English</b> course <b>B.</b> The results show that the most common errors made in the national test are subject verb agreement and tense. Those two features had also a worsening in the <b>English</b> course <b>B.</b> The genitive errors have also doubled in <b>English</b> course <b>B.</b> The best improvement happened with the capital letters. Other features either stayed the same or improved slightly. One of the solutions for grammatical errors could be that teachers and students pay more attention to it and that the teachers include more grammar in their lessons so that the students have an opportunity to improve...|$|R
