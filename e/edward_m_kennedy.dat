5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator <b>Edward</b> <b>M.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Abernathy {{traveled}} around the country supporting Senator <b>Edward</b> <b>M.</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. However, he shocked critics {{a few weeks before}} the 1980 November election, when he endorsed the front-runner, Ronald Reagan, over the struggling presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter. With an inevitable Republican victory, Abernathy said that he felt that he had to endorse Reagan, so that African Americans might gain some respect in that political party. After the disappointing performance of the Reagan Administration on civil rights and other areas, Abernathy withdrew his endorsement of Reagan in 1984, remaining a Democrat until his death.|$|R

5000|$|By August 2009, McCain {{had over}} 1.1 million {{followers}} of his Twitter account. [...] He has called Twitter [...] "a phenomenal way of communicating." [...] He also continued to appear frequently {{on one of}} his favorite platforms of the past, the Sunday morning network news interview shows. [...] The same month, McCain voted against confirmation of Obama's Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor; after being undecided for a long time, he eventually said, [...] "There is no doubt that Judge Sotomayor has the professional background and qualifications that one hopes for in a Supreme Court nominee.... but I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint." [...] Through this point in 2009, McCain had sided with the Republican Party in closely divided votes more often than he had during any point of his senatorial career. [...] Following fellow Senator <b>Edward</b> <b>M.</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> death {{towards the end of the}} month, McCain spoke at his friend's wake, recalling their sometime battles in the Senate which would be followed by [...] "that infectious laugh of his that could wake the dead and cheer up the most beleaguered soul. The place won't be the same without him." [...] McCain opposed Obama's health care plan, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying [...] "Americans have made it abundantly clear that they do not want government taking over their health-care decisions." [...] He also opposed bipartisan efforts to forge a climate change bill, despite having made a name for himself earlier in the decade with similar proposals and despite his frequent allies Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman being present in the effort. [...] In November 2009, Senator McCain also joined with many of his Republican colleagues in the first failed filibuster against an Obama judicial nominee, David Hamilton. [...] Two of the Republicans, McCain and Lindsey Graham, had been members of the [...] "Gang of 14"; McCain did not explain his vote in terms of the [...] "extraordinary circumstances" [...] clause of that agreement, but Graham said Hamilton's views were [...] "so far removed from the mainstream" [...] that a vote against cloture was warranted.|$|R
