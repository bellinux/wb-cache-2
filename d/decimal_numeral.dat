25|$|In the 10th century, Middle-Eastern mathematicians {{extended}} the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> system to include fractions, as recorded in a treatise by Syrian mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi in 952–953. The decimal point notation {{was introduced by}} Sind ibn Ali, who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> system (also called base-ten {{positional}} numeral system, {{and occasionally}} called denary) {{is the standard}} system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system {{is often referred to}} as Decimal notation.|$|E
25|$|Examples are Brahmi numerals, Greek numerals, Hebrew numerals, Roman numerals, and Chinese numerals. Very {{large numbers}} were {{difficult}} to represent in these old numeral systems, and, only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulty were completely solved {{with the introduction of}} the Hindu–Arabic numeral system for representing integers. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called decimal fractions or decimal numbers for forming the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> system.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{than the}} {{attestations}} {{in the full}} function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set, along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> value. For instance, there {{is a set of}} 25 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 4th century BC and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.|$|E
25|$|The Classical Age {{refers to}} the period when much of the Indian Subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (ca. 320 CE–550 CE). This period is called the Golden Age of India and was marked by {{extensive}} achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, , literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> system, including the concept of zero, was invented in India during this period. The peace and prosperity created under Guptas leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral,</b> or just decimal, or, {{improperly}} decimal number, refers {{generally to}} the notation {{of a number}} in the decimal system, which contains a decimal separator (for example 10.00 or 3.14159). Sometimes these terms are used for the any numeral in the decimal system. A decimal may also refer to any digit after the decimal separator, such as in [...] "3.14 is the approximation of [...] to two decimals".|$|E
50|$|The {{counting}} rod numerals {{system has}} place value and <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> for computation, {{and was used}} widely by Chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the Han dynasty to the 16th century.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{evidence of}} <b>decimal</b> place value <b>numerals</b> in India and southeast Asia {{is from the}} middle of the first millennium CE. [...] A copper plate from Gujarat, India mentions the date 595 CE, written in a decimal place value notation, although there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the plate. [...] <b>Decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> recording the years 683 CE have also been found in stone inscriptions in Indonesia and Cambodia, where Indian cultural influence was substantial.|$|R
2500|$|Just as {{the same}} {{fraction}} can be written {{in more than one}} way, the same decimal may have more than one representation. [...] 1.0 and 0.999... are two different <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> representing the natural number1. There are infinitely many other ways of representing the number1, for example 1.00, 1.000, and so on.|$|R
2500|$|The {{numbers that}} are {{represented}} by <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> are the decimal fractions (sometimes called decimal numbers), that is, the rational numbers that may be expressed as a fraction, the denominator {{of which is a}} power of ten. For example, the numerals [...] represent the fractions , , [...] More generally, a decimal with [...] digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator , whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.|$|E
2500|$|The long {{division}} allows computing {{the infinite}} decimal expansion of a rational number. If the rational number is a decimal fraction, the division stops eventually, producing a <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral,</b> {{which may be}} prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many 0. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainder are less than the divisor, {{there are only a}} finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a repeating decimal. For example, ...|$|E
2500|$|Pope Sylvester II or Silvester II (– 12 May 1003) was Pope from 2 April 999 to {{his death}} in 1003. Originally known as Gerbert of Aurillac ( [...] or [...] ), he was a {{prolific}} scholar and teacher. He endorsed and promoted study of Arab and Greco-Roman arithmetic, mathematics, and astronomy, reintroducing to Europe the abacus and armillary sphere, which had been lost to Latin (though not Byzantine) Europe {{since the end of}} the Greco-Roman era. He is said to be the first to introduce in Europe the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> system using Arabic numerals. He was the first French Pope.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> do {{not allow}} an exact {{representation}} for all real numbers, so e.g. for the real number [...] Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real , being less than 10-5 off; and so decimals are widely used in science, engineering and everyday life.|$|R
50|$|Fishermen {{along the}} Chimú coast spoke a {{language}} called Lengua Pescadora (fisherman language) by Spanish missionaries, and disambiguated as Yunga Pescadora by linguists; {{this may be}} the same as Quingnam. A letter found during excavations at Magdalena de Cao Viejo in the El Brujo Archaeological Complex includes a list of <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> which may be Quingnam or Pescadora, but they are not Mochica.|$|R
50|$|Other early {{computers}} were character oriented, providing instructions for performing arithmetic on character strings of <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals.</b> On these machines the basic data element was an alphanumeric character, typically encoded in six bits. UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II used word addressing, with 12-character words. IBM examples include IBM 702, IBM 705, the IBM 1400 series, IBM 7010, and the IBM 7080.|$|R
2500|$|A third decimal {{representation}} {{was employed}} in a verse composition technique, later labelled Bhuta-sankhya (literally, [...] "object numbers") used by early Sanskrit authors of technical books. [...] Since many early technical works were composed in verse, numbers were often represented by {{objects in the}} natural or religious world that correspondence to them; this allowed a many-to-one correspondence for each number and made verse composition easier. [...] According to , the number 4, for example, [...] could be represented by the word [...] "Veda" [...] (since there were four of these religious texts), the number 32 by the word [...] "teeth" [...] (since a full set consists of 32), and the number 1 by [...] "moon" [...] (since {{there is only one}} moon). [...] So, Veda/teeth/moon would correspond to the <b>decimal</b> <b>numeral</b> 1324, as the convention for numbers was to enumerate their digits from right to left. [...] The earliest reference employing object numbers is a ca. 269 CE [...] Sanskrit text, Yavanajātaka (literally [...] "Greek horoscopy") of Sphujidhvaja, a versification of an earlier (ca. 150 CE) Indian prose adaptation of a lost work of Hellenistic astrology. Such use seems {{to make the case that}} by the mid-3rd century CE, the decimal place value system was familiar, at least to readers of astronomical and astrological texts in India.|$|E

5000|$|In other words, in {{his book}} he {{advocated}} {{the use of the}} digits 0-9, and of place value. Until this time Europe used Roman Numerals, making modern mathematics almost impossible. The book thus made an important contribution to the spread of <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals.</b> The spread of the Hindu-Arabic system, however, as Ore writes, was [...] "long-drawn-out", taking many more centuries to spread widely, and did not become complete until the later part of the 16th century, accelerating dramatically only in the 1500s with the advent of printing.|$|R
2500|$|When spoken, binary numerals {{are usually}} read digit-by-digit, {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} them from <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals.</b> For example, the binary numeral 100 is pronounced one zero zero, rather than one hundred, to make its binary nature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing {{to refer to the}} numeral as one hundred (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as [...] "four" [...] (the correct value), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.|$|R

Like the Western orthography used to write Raga language, it represents the velar nasal ng and prenasalised consonant ngg using modified forms of the letters n and g respectively, but represents the labiovelar consonants bw, mw and vw using digraphs. Although in some respects it is a relatively straightforward imitation of the Latin alphabet, Avoiuli has a few distinctive features.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 7th century, decimal numbers {{begin to}} appear in {{inscriptions}} in Southeast Asia as well as in India. Some scholars hold that they appeared even earlier. A 6th century copper-plate grant at Mankani bearing the numeral 346 (corresponding to 594 CE) is often cited. But its reliability is subject to dispute. The first indisputable occurrence of 0 in an inscription occurs at Gwalior in 876 CE, containing a numeral [...] "270" [...] in a notation surprisingly similar to ours. Throughout the 8th and 9th centuries, both the old Brahmi numerals and the new <b>decimal</b> <b>numerals</b> were used, sometimes appearing in the same inscriptions.
