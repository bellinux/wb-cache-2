50|$|The {{accepted}} {{structure was}} designed on the cantilever principle {{to cross the}} river and its flats, a length of 2,424 feet, with fourteen spans; thirteen were to be 176 feet and one of 136 feet. It was stated {{that one of the}} advantages was that the movement caused by temperature variations would not impact on the appearance or function of the sewer, which would have a grade of 1 in 2,500, when compared to steel construction. The cantilevers were to be splayed, to take account of horizontal wind stresses. The pre-cast concrete pipes (ovoid to achieve maximum <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency),</b> in 8 foot lengths, were to be built into the structure. Trial bores along the site of the aqueduct showed that rock existed from 5-40 feet below the surface. However, reinforced concrete piles were to be used to support the bases of the piers. The reinforcement throughout was to be of ordinary commercial steel rods, which were lapped rather than joined into continuous bars. The steel rods in the upper booms of the cantilevers were arranged in concentric rings around the longitudinal rods. The gaps between each cantilever section were to be spanned by a 40-foot girder section fixed at one end, but free to move at the other. An expansion joint was to be provided at each span, its design being similar to that of an ordinary ‘stuffing box’. A footpath, acting as a structural form, would be provided throughout the whole length of the structure. At the time of its completion it would be considered one of the finest concrete structures in Australia (Stone, 1920: 49-51).|$|E

30|$|The VRM {{bioreactor}} employs rotating submerged membranes. The submerged membranes allow greater <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> {{reflected in}} greater permeability, {{due to their}} operation at substantially lower fluxes than side stream systems, since fouling tends to increase with increasing flux (Judd 2006). For such membranes, fouling is either internal (i.e. pore plugging or restriction) or surface (i.e. cake formation). Fouling mechanisms of a MBR process are very complex, as previously mentioned in the introduction section. The techniques used to control the fouling in the VRM are discussed below.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the strongest}} {{influence}} on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> was the inlet orientation. The horizontal inlet orientation resulted in the best <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Previous studies considering mixing time have also observed the influence of inlet orientation on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (Maruyama et al. 1982; Dakshinamoorthy et al. 2006; Zughbi and Rakib 2004; Tian and Roberts 2008). However, contradictory results showed up about how the inlet orientation influences the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (Shivaram 2007). One {{of the reasons they}} show contradictory results might just come down to experimental design. Inlet momentum and the interaction between inlet momentum and inlet orientation also had {{influence on the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> particularly for the mixing index. The effect of inlet orientation upon mixing was much stronger for a high inlet momentum than for a low inlet momentum. In general, similar results have been reported in laboratory experiments (Tian and Roberts 2008). All these studies, however, evaluated the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> using the mixing time indicator and they did not affirm the relative importance of inlet orientation, inlet momentum and their interaction.|$|E
30|$|CFD {{was applied}} to {{determine}} the empirical effects of inlet momentum and inlet orientation upon the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the water quality of water storage tanks using a factorial design. For a small depth-to-diameter ratio (H/D =  0.25), {{the most important factor}} for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> was the inlet orientation. Inlet momentum and the interaction between inlet momentum and inlet orientation also had an influence on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The effect of inlet orientation upon mixing is much stronger for a high inlet momentum than for a low inlet momentum. Regarding the water quality efficiency, the strongest influence was the inlet momentum. Inlet orientation and the interaction inlet orientation-inlet momentum are not significant. Since the order of importance of the factors that influence the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> vary from those that influence the water quality efficiency, none of the hydraulics indexes demonstrated good correlation to water quality. For large depth-to-diameter ratio (H/D =  4), the inlet orientation had the strongest influence on both the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the water quality. None of the other factors were significant. The short-circuiting and mixing indexes presented a good correlation with the effluent disinfectant fraction and could be used to indicate the water quality for large depth-to-diameter ratio storage tanks.|$|E

Measurements were performed in a coppice plantation on 1 -year-old shoots under optimal irrigation. Hydraulic architecture was characterized through estimates of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (the ratio of conducting sapwood area to leaf area, AX:AL; leaf- and xylem-specific hydraulic conductance of defoliated shoots, kSL and kSS, respectively; apparent whole-plant leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, kplant) and xylem safety (water potential inducing 50 % loss in hydraulic conductance). The eight genotypes spanned a significant range of kSL from 2. 63 kg s 21 m 22 MPa 21 to 4. 18 kg s 21 m 22 MPa 21, variations being mostly driven by kSS rather than AX:AL. There was a strong trade-off between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and xylem safety. Values of kSL correlated positively with kplant, indicating that highpressure flowmeter (HPFM) measurements of stem <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> accurately reflected whole-plant water transport efficiency of field-grown plants at maximum transpiration rate. No clear relationship could be found between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and either net CO 2 assimilation rates, water-use efficiency estimates (intrinsic wateruse efficiency and carbon isotope discrimination against 13 C), or stomatal characteristics (stomatal density and stomatal pore area index). Estimates of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> were negatively associated with relative growth rate.

In this study, the <b>hydraulic</b> inception <b>efficiency</b> of several types of gully gratings on steep roads, including a new grating with angled bars on a parallelogram cross-section was investigated experimentally.

The treatment efficiency of these systems is strongly related to the hydrodynamics and hydraulic residence time. In this study, we developed a physical model and used rhodamine-WT as a tracer to conduct flume experiments. An equivalent Reynolds number was assumed, and the flume was a 1 / 25 -scale model. Emergent obstructions (EOs), submerged obstructions (SOs), and high- and low-density emergent vegetation were placed {{along the sides of}} the flume, and 49 tracer tests were performed. We altered the density, spatial extent, aspect ratio, and configurations of the obstructions and emergent vegetation to observe changes in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a deep-water wetland. In the cases of low-aspect-ratio obstructions, the effects of the EOs on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> were significantly stronger than those of the SOs. In contrast, in the cases of high-aspect-ratio obstructions, the improvement effects of the EOs were weaker than those of the SOs. The high-aspect-ratio EOs altered the flow direction and constrained the water conveyance area, which apparently caused a short-circuited flow phenomenon, resulting in a decrease in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Most cases revealed that the emergent vegetation improved the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>efficiency</b> more than the EOs.

A groundwater modeling package (MODFLOW) {{was used to}} optimize three design parameters (length-to-width ratio, inlet/outlet-to-length ratio, and substrate size configuration).

We conclude that MODFLOW is suitable for designing CWs, accurately predicting that increasing hydraulic conductivity from surface to bottom layers could improve performance. However, the effect of vegetation, which decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the surface layer, should be considered to improve simulation results. Multilayer substrate configuration, with increasing hydraulic conductivity from the surface to bottom layers, significantly increased pollutant removal compared with monolayer configuration. The spatial variation in pollutant transport and degradation through the filling substrate showed that the multilayer configuration was able to increase use of the available space and moderately reduced short-circuiting and dead zones.
