40|$|The EU {{and other}} European {{institutions}} have launched {{a wide range}} of educational initiatives over the past 50 years in order to foster <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and bring Europe ‘closer to the people’. However, the efficacy of these efforts is questionable. In the EU, education policy (and in particular, curriculum policy) is governed by subsidiarity: citizenship education curricula are designed at the national level, with limited input from European institutions. This paper examines whether <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> education <b>initiatives</b> have impact upon national-level curricula and, moreover, how the concept of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has been defined and constructed in national citizenship education programmes. These questions are explored here using qualitative, socio-historical methods through a case study of curricular reform in the Republic of Ireland. This case illustrates {{that there has been a}} gradual deepening and broadening of the way in which <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is conceptualized in the Irish curriculum. However, this remains a narrow conception of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> and one which ultimately limits both the impact on national citizenship and the prospects of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship...</b>|$|R

The rapidly {{changing}} politics of citizenship in the face of migration, diversity, heightened concerns about security, and financial and economic crises, has left <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> as one of the major political and social challenges to European integration. Enacting <b>European</b> <b>Citizenship</b> develops a distinctive perspective on <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and its impact on European integration by focusing on 'acts' of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The authors examine a broad range of cases – including those of the Roma, Sinti, Kurds, sex workers, youth and other 'minorities' or marginalised peoples – to illuminate the ways in which the institutions and practices of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> can hinder as well as enable claims for justices, rights and equality.

The article begins with an outline of the development of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and a review of some contemporary theoretical debates about the spatialities of citizenship. It then considers how <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> might be theorized in geographical terms, before turning specifically to {{the relationship}} between <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and regionality. Drawing on the case-study research, this relationship is examined through four themes: identity, political rights, social rights and civic engagement.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>{{citizenship}}</b> {{is marked}} by a tension: between a citizenship that is derivative of the nation-state and a citizenship that is defined by free movement. Approaching this tension as symptomatic of a deep-rooted contradiction between integration and mobility that is constitutive of modern social formations, this article develops a political sociology of mobility that challenges territorial and culturalist accounts of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> It does so by exploring the political enactment of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> by marginalized subjects, whose engagement in relations of exchange serves as the ground for acts of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> that ‘mobilize mobility’. This is illustrated by an analysis of the 2005 Declaration for the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the issue raised with respect to the <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> for the new national Catalans on the assumption that Catalonia becomes a new state. Several questions arise: Does the acquisition of a new nationality imply the loss of the <b>European</b> <b>citizenship?</b> Are there any vested rights? In case these rights are lost, since when? In order to address these questions, we will analyse the link between <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and nationality, as well as the consequences on citizenship if Catalonia secedes from Spain. This study will take into account the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union defending its competence to ensure compliance with <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> according to EU law. Two additional questions follow from this analysis: firstly the obligation to negotiate in case of secession, and secondly the possibility that the <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has gone a step further evolving to a new concept.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{is a new}} concept, {{which has}} evolved {{with the process of}} European integration. Starting from the younger generations, the EU seeks to {{establish}} a modern and innovative view of citizenship through three fundamental elements - rights, identity and participation - that could lead to new ways of conceiving the relationship of institutions-citizens and citizenscitizens. The idea of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> tends to overcome the historical idea of national states and national identity. It does this by reinforcing its supranational nature and developing an attitude of tolerance towards diversity and human/minority rights. Thus, to verify the impact <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has on the younger generation in Bulgaria, this research is based on an inter-ethnic sample of 30 interviews (16 Bulgarians, 14 Bulgarian Turks) and applies a qualitative comparative analysis method. This research seeks to answer these two main questions: 1) How do young Bulgarians perceive the concept of EU citizenship? 2) How do young Bulgarians perceive the new <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> in regard to the inter-ethnic relations in their own country? The study suggests that the EU’s attempt to promote <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is underachieving. On the one hand, young Bulgarian people tend to be well exposed to <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> irrespective of their ethnic belonging. On the other hand, the majority of them are sceptical of the tangible value of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> for the reinforcement of a more encompassing and shared notion of diversity and minority rights...|$|R

40|$|Strengthening <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} as a ‘cure’ for the democratic deficit {{and the lack of}} legitimacy of the European Union (European Commission, 2001; Habermas, 2011). We distinguish two possible ways to strengthen citizenship: a cognitive one (more knowledge about the EU leads to a stronger citizenship) and a utilitarian one (inhabitants of countries that benefit more from their EU-membership have a stronger feeling of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship).</b> We apply a multilevel analysis on the results of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study to test both explanatory models. 70, 502 adolescents from 21 European member states were questioned in this study. The analysis shows that knowledge about the EU only has a limited effect on <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The degree in which a member state contributes to the European budget doesn’t seem to {{have an effect on the}} strength of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The analysis rather shows that trust in national political institutions is the most important determinant for the development of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> We conclude with several possible explanations for the relation between political trust and the legitimacy of multilevel government within the European Union, which could lead to future research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|When {{interpreted}} as <b>citizenship</b> of the <b>European</b> Union, {{the development of}} <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has prompted a series of debates on rights, membership and belonging, and democracy and constitutionalism. These debates can be enriched by highlighting {{the ways in which}} <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is enacted by a variety of actors. It is argued that acts of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> occur under two different dynamics: extension and assertion. Acts under the dynamic of extension are most often acts extending existing legal citizenship regimes by formal and public institutions, such as the European Court of Justice. Acts under the hitherto relatively neglected dynamic of assertion {{are likely to be more}} diffuse in location and visibility and uncertain in their goals and impacts. Understanding such acts – and the links between acts under the two dynamics – has the potential to reinvigorate and expand research agendas in the study of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{establishes}} a precedent whereby the exercise {{and protection of}} rights - the practice of citizenship - is no longer contingent on residency within the jurisdiction of national citizenship. Free movement rights have allowed European citizens to cross borders and participate more nearly as political and legal equals within the host society. At the same time, however, <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has largely failed {{to account for the}} past or future migration of third-country nationals (TCNs) - those who are not citizens of any Member State - into or within the European Union. As a result, the creation of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> has arguably had the unfortunate side effect of further distinguishing and excluding TCNs from the emerging European society. This Note argues that the current legal status of TCNs hinders successful diversity management by individual Member States, undermines European integration, and deprives TCNs of fundamental rights. The Note proposes that <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> should be expanded to allow TCNs to acquire <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> without the simultaneous authority over the citizenship status of TCNs would benefit the project of migrant integration into local, national, and transnational societies and help further the democratization of European governance. In addition, a redefined <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> could trigger a fundamental rethinking of national citizenship, potentially undermine the destructive influence of the extreme right, and, perhaps, lead to a more complete decoupling of the political and legal content of citizenshipfrom the idea of nation...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{enlargement}} of the European Union (EU) has created debate as to the suitability of current structures and policies for effectively engaging citizens and developing social cohesion. Education and specifically modern foreign language (MFL) teaching are argued by the literature to {{play a key role}} in equipping young people to interact and communicate effectively in the ever-changing European context and to exercise their rights as European citizens. However, much of the empirical research to date has focused on adult understandings of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Furthermore, very few studies consider whether current MFL teaching is addressing issues of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> or offer a comparison of provision between one member state and another. This study presents questionnaire data from four European countries to investigate young people's current understanding and awareness of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and the perceived contribution of their language learning experience to this awareness. Findings suggest that knowledge about <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is patchy across the four countries. Reports on learning in MFL lessons indicate a mismatch between the role identified for the subject in the development of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and the situation in the classroom. Data gathered from English pupils suggest that these issues are more acute in England than they are in France, Spain or Ireland. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{citizenship}} in relatively new legal {{order of the}} European Union has its own meaning and dynamics compared to national citizenship. One of the important questions regarding this transnational form of citizenship is how to place this <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> in a constitutional context in the European Union. In that context, this thesis, examines the main research question: How does <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> affect the process of constitutionalisation of the European Union? This question implies that <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is of a constitutional nature and affects {{the characteristics of the}} European Union, transforming from an international organisation cooperating on economic aims towards a more constitutional legal order. Constitutionalisation of the European Union is regarded as the process in which the European Union acquires more features that are commonly found in a constitution, and which is explored through the prism of four constitutional elements: the vertical division of powers, the existence of a common ideology (democracy and fundamental rights), justiciability and constitutional primacy.
