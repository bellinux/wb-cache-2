5|$|This form of {{treatment}} {{is meant to}} reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the allergic reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, phototherapy and photochemotherapy are the two major <b>desensitization</b> treatments.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid <b>desensitization</b> of glutamate receptors in chicken spinal cord and rat hippocampal neurons. Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply glutamate and other agonists including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of <b>desensitization,</b> treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|While {{lanthanum}} has pharmacological {{effects on}} several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts {{at the same}} modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc, a known negative allosteric modulator. The lanthanum cation La3+ is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing <b>desensitization</b> in a subunit configuration dependent manner.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers {{and was very}} well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects are reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, <b>desensitization,</b> violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor <b>desensitization</b> on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} treatment, enzyme potentiated <b>desensitization</b> (EPD), {{has been}} tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective. EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring <b>desensitization,</b> or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried {{for the treatment of}} autoimmune diseases but evidence does not show effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapies {{that have}} been used for ORS include {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy, eye movement <b>desensitization</b> and reprocessing.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{options for}} semen allergy include {{avoiding}} exposure to seminal fluid {{by use of}} condoms and attempting <b>desensitization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of allergen immunotherapy for food allergies is unclear, thus {{is not recommended}} as of 2015. A number of <b>desensitization</b> techniques are being studied, though.|$|E
25|$|Physical and {{occupational}} therapy show low quality {{evidence to support}} their use. Physical therapy interventions may include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, progressive weight bearing, tactile <b>desensitization,</b> massage, and contrast bath therapy.|$|E
25|$|To prevent congestion, allergies can {{be treated}} {{by the use of}} antihistamines, decongestants and nasal sprays, and allergy <b>desensitization.</b> Recently {{developed}} antihistamines do not cross the blood-brain barrier and do not produce drowsiness, but may only be available by prescription.|$|E
25|$|The mating pathway {{employs a}} G protein-coupled receptor, G protein, RGS protein, and three-tiered MAPK {{signaling}} cascade that is homologous {{to those found}} in humans. This feature has been exploited by biologists to investigate basic mechanisms of signal transduction and <b>desensitization.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{obviously}} many other treatment options, with cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and Eye movement <b>desensitization</b> and reprocessing being {{some of the}} more popular options, all these involve an individual changing the way they think about their disease and experiences in life.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{movement}} <b>desensitization</b> and reprocessing (EMDR) {{has been}} studied as a possible treatment for agoraphobia, with poor results. As such, EMDR is only recommended in cases where cognitive-behavioral approaches have proven ineffective or in cases where agoraphobia has developed following trauma.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a {{study at}} Iowa State University, the University of Michigan, and Vrije Universiteit by Nicholas L. Carnagey and colleagues found that {{participants}} who had previously played a violent video game had lower heart rate and galvanic skin response while viewing filmed real violence, demonstrating a physiological <b>desensitization</b> to violence.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a {{study by}} Bruce D. Bartholow and colleagues at the University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Michigan, Vrije Universiteit, and University of North Carolina using event related {{potential}} linked video game violence exposure to brain processes hypothetically reflecting <b>desensitization.</b> The authors suggested that chronic exposure to violent video games have lasting harmful effects on brain function and behavior.|$|E
25|$|IgE {{also has}} an {{essential}} role in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests in various allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and specific types of chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. IgE also plays a pivotal role in responses to allergens, such as: anaphylactic drugs, bee stings, and antigen preparations used in <b>desensitization</b> immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Jeanne B. Funk and {{her colleagues}} at the Department of Psychology at the University of Toledo, {{examined}} the relationship between exposure to violence through media and real-life, and <b>desensitization</b> (reflected by loss of empathy and changes in attitudes toward violence) in fourth and fifth grade pupils. Funk found that exposure to video game violence was associated with lowered empathy and stronger proviolence attitudes.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes <b>desensitization</b> of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be <b>desensitization</b> of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This <b>desensitization</b> could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to a psychoactive {{substance}} can cause {{changes in the}} structure and functioning of neurons, as the nervous system tries to re-establish the homeostasis disrupted {{by the presence of}} the drug (see also, neuroplasticity). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become more responsive to neurotransmitters; this is called sensitization. Conversely, overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called <b>desensitization</b> or tolerance. Sensitization and <b>desensitization</b> are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a single exposure. These processes are thought {{to play a role in}} drug dependence and addiction. Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) is often referred to simply as depression, antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desensitization</b> of the postsynaptic receptors is a {{decrease}} {{in response to the}} same neurotransmitter stimulus. It means that the strength of a synapse may in effect diminish as a train of action potentials arrive in rapid succession – a phenomenon that gives rise to the so-called frequency dependence of synapses. The nervous system exploits this property for computational purposes, and can tune its synapses through such means as phosphorylation of the proteins involved.|$|E
25|$|The G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinases (GRKs) are protein kinases that phosphorylate only active GPCRs. G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. They {{constitute a}} family of seven mammalian serine-threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate agonist-bound receptor. GRKs-mediated receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates profound impairment of receptor signaling and <b>desensitization.</b> Activity of GRKs and subcellular targeting is tightly regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein subunits, lipids, anchoring proteins and calcium-sensitive proteins.|$|E
25|$|REBT {{posits that}} the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this {{normally}} includes {{a wide array of}} homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The assignments may for example include <b>desensitization</b> tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the {{approach}} {{is to focus on}} the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person’s specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for depression. However, there is often an emphasis on cognitive restructuring due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as eye movement <b>desensitization</b> and reprocessing (EMDR) {{have been shown to be}} effective.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{behavioral}} therapy became widely {{utilized by}} {{researchers in the}} United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the behaviorist learning theory of Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and Clark L. Hull. In Britain, Joseph Wolpe, who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of systematic <b>desensitization,</b> applied behavioral research {{to the treatment of}} neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. British psychologist Hans Eysenck presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is a set}} of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, seeing or hearing things that others do not, and delirium tremens (DTs). receptors. The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and <b>desensitization</b> of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, convulsions and neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{are given}} about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor phosphorylation (which {{would change the}} receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from G-proteins (leading to receptor <b>desensitization),</b> μ-opioid receptor internalization or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the cAMP pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.) CCK might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically proglumide, {{have been shown to}} slow the development of tolerance to morphine.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol, tolerance {{has been found}} to develop with exposure to increased levels of allopregnanolone and related inhibitory neurosteroids. This includes downregulation and <b>desensitization</b> of the GABAA receptor, reduced effects of allopregnanolone and other GABAA receptor activators (e.g., GABA and benzodiazepines), and rebound or withdrawal effects upon falls in allopregnanolone levels. Moreover, changes in allopregnanolone levels have been implicated in adverse neuropsychiatric effects associated with the menstrual cycle (e.g., dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability) and postpartum period (e.g., postpartum depression), as well as in catamenial epilepsy (seizures).|$|E
25|$|Meditation {{techniques}} {{have also been}} used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are {{used in conjunction with}} other behavioral techniques. Originally used with systematic <b>desensitization,</b> relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation {{are a few of the}} techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.|$|E
25|$|Receptor <b>desensitization</b> is {{mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{movement}} <b>desensitization</b> and reprocessing (EMDR) is {{a therapy}} for treating traumatic memories that involves elements of exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Despite controversy remaining in some quarters, EMDR is rated {{at the highest}} level of efficacy for PTSD by numerous organizations, most notably by the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies in a comprehensive study of all effective treatments for PTSD. There is an extensive theoretical model called adaptive information processing (AIP) underlying EMDR. The role and mechanism of eye movements, or more generally, bilateral, dual attention stimulation (BLS) is still unclear, and though early studies cast doubt on their necessity for EMDR's efficacy, BLS is still considered {{an integral part of the}} system by most practicing therapists.|$|E
25|$|Memantine {{acts as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{at different}} neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid <b>desensitization</b> of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at Alpha-7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. Alpha-7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment. It {{has been shown that}} the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, {{even in the absence of}} a general decrease in the number of neurons, and nicotinic receptor agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.|$|E
25|$|The western yellowjacket {{is often}} a pest to humans. As outdoor human {{activity}} has increased, so, too, has the nuisance of V. pensylvanica. Concentrated garbage has become an alternative food supply, and colonies have emerged in and around areas of human impact, such as recreational parks and resorts. Though they tend not to sting unless a violent struggle occurs, they nonetheless violently protect their nests and can sting repeatedly. As a result, increased efforts into pest control have occurred. Because the chance of colony disturbance and resulting stings is great, the species is recommended to be controlled during outbreaks. The recommended treatment of stings is antihistamine ointments and tablets to reduce reactions. Those who are highly sensitive or allergic to stings should speak to a physician about alternatives such as emergency kits with premeasured doses of epinephrine or <b>desensitization</b> procedures.|$|E
25|$|Like all benzodiazepines, {{clonazepam}} is a GABA-positive allosteric modulator. One-third {{of individuals}} treated with benzodiazepines {{for longer than}} four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. High dosage and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal seizures and psychosis can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces {{the severity of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor <b>desensitization,</b> down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in gene transcription coding.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{developed from}} the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT {{is based on the}} theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as systematic <b>desensitization,</b> socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.|$|E
