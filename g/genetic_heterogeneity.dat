Sometimes a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested {{in order to establish}} which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked allelic heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30 years.|$|E

40|$|Discovering {{molecular}} heterogeneities in phenotypically defined {{disease is}} {{of critical importance}} both for understanding pathogenic mechanisms of complex diseases and for finding efficient treatments. Recently, it has been recognized that cellular phenotypes {{are determined by the}} concerted actions of many functionally related genes in modular fashions. The underlying modular mechanisms should help the understanding of hidden <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> of complex diseases. We defined a putative disease module to be the functional gene groups in terms of both biological process and cellular localization, which are significantly enriched with genes highly variably expressed across the disease samples. As a validation, we used two large cancer datasets to evaluate the ability of the modules for correctly partitioning samples. Then, we sought the subtypes of complex diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) using a public dataset. Finally, the clinical significance of the identified subtypes was verified by survival analysis. In two validation datasets, we achieved highly accurate partitions that best fit the clinical cancer phenotypes. Then, for the notoriously heterogeneous DLBCL, we demonstrated that two partitioned subtypes using an identified module (“cellular response to stress”) had very different 5 -year overall rates (65 % vs. 14 %) and were highly significantly (P < 0. 007) correlated with the clinical survival rate. Finally, we built a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard prediction model that included 4 genes as risk predictors for survival over DLBCL. The proposed modular approach is a promising computational strategy for peeling off <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> and understanding the modular mechanisms of human diseases such as cancers...|$|R
25|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent, potentially lethal, monogenic human disorder. It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained {{to a large extent}} by its <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> and modifier genes. It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases — a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias. Over 50% of patients with ADPKD eventually develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. ADPKD is estimated to affect at least 1 in every 1000 individuals worldwide, making this disease the most common inherited kidney disorder with a diagnosed prevalence of 1:2000 and incidence of 1:3000-1:8000 in a global scale.|$|E
25|$|Although {{statistically}} {{not significant}} enough sample size to be a nationwide projection, {{a study on}} 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA showed a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Another clustering analyses performed on data from autosomal ancestry-sensitive SNPs – providing somewhat approximate representation of the bi-parentally inherited part of the genome – demonstrated a major European component (overall 78.5%) in the pooled Argentinean sample, whereas the Native American component (overall 17.3%) was lower but considerable, and the African component was very small (overall 4.1%). Despite this general trend in the genetic variation, {{it should be noted}} that analyses revealed a considerable <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> at the individual level, also noticed before in a smaller number of Argentinean samples. About 40% of the sampled individuals attained more than 90% of European ancestry, but the Native American proportion was as high as 80% (although this was observed only in a single individual). Such findings reflect the dynamics of the recent demographic history of the extant Argentinean population, indicating that individuals retaining a higher proportion of European ancestry could be descendants from the recent newcomers to the Argentinean population, whereas those with a higher amount of Native American admixture could be descendants from the first contact between the European and Amerindian populations, starting approximately 500 years ago.|$|E

2500|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of insect colonies makes them theoretically susceptible to infection en masse; the high similarity {{of each group}} members genome means that each is susceptible (and resistant) to the same parasites, whilst experimental manipulation has demonstrated that genetically heterogenous colonies of B. terrestris have lower levels of parasite infection than homogenous colonies. To increase genetic diversity, colonies can {{increase the number of}} queens and/or increase the number of mating partners a queen has— it is thought these social immune benefits may explain the seemingly costly polyandry found in social insect colonies. Social Hymenoptera also have exceptionally high rates of meiotic recombination when compared against a wide range of higher eukaryote taxa which further increases genetic diversity. [...] Ongoing theoretical and empirical work is seeking to tease out the scenarios in which these immune benefits of <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> can be negated due to concomitant costs, e.g., the increased intra-colony conflict and/or susceptibility to an increasing number of parasites which comes with increased genetic diversity.|$|E

Two well-studied systems, cellular control of molybdenum level by the ion-transporter MOT 1 and flowering-time regulation by the FRI-FLC expression network, and a novel association for Leaf serration are used to illustrate the contribution of major individual loci, expression pathways, and gene-by-environment interactions to the <b>genetic</b> variance <b>heterogeneity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Immune {{function}} {{is likely to}} be a critical determinant of an organism's fitness, yet most natural animal and plant populations exhibit tremendous genetic variation for immune traits. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental heterogeneity may retard the long-term efficiency of natural selection and even maintain polymorphism, provided alternative host genotypes are favoured under different environmental conditions. ‘Environment’ in this context refers to abiotic factors such as ambient temperature or availability of nutrient resources, genetic diversity of pathogens or competing physiological demands on the host. These factors are generally controlled in laboratory experiments measuring immune performance, but variation in them {{is likely to be}} very important in the evolution of resistance to infection.

Studies suggest there are substantial <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> for different populations. Here we tried to identify novel susceptibility loci for FH in a Chinese pedigree. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a SNP-based genome-wide linkage scan with the Chinese FH pedigree. Two suggestive linkage loci not previously reported were identified on chromosomes 3 q 25. 1 - 26. 1 (NPL = 9. 01, nominal P, 0. 00001, and simulated occurrence per genome scan = 1. 08) and 21 q 22. 3 (NPL = 8. 95, nominal P, 0. 00001, and simulated occurrence per genome scan = 1. 26). In the interaction analysis with a trimmed version of the pedigree, we obtained a significantly increased joint LOD score (2. 70) compared with that obtained when assuming the two loci uncorrelated, suggesting that more than one locus was involved in this pedigree.
