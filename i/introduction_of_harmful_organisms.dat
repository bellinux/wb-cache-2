40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of harmful organisms in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of harmful organisms associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of harmful organisms supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> into the EU. Accounting for possible economic impacts of harmful organisms in determining the frequencies of reduced checks may help optimize the current syste...|$|E

Numerous and diversified organisms are transferred daily from a donor to a recipient port. Developed to prevent these introduction events, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments will enter into force in 2017. This international convention is asking for the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>Harmful</b> Aquatic <b>Organisms</b> and Pathogens. In this review, we highlight the urgent need to develop cost-effective methods to: (1) perform the biological analyses required by the convention; and (2) assess the effectiveness of two main ballast water management strategies, i. e. the ballast water exchange {{and the use of}} ballast water treatment systems. We have compiled the biological analyses required by the convention, and performed a comprehensive evaluation of the potential and challenges of the use of genetic tools in this context.

40|$|Phytosanitary import {{inspections}} {{are important}} to avoid entry of harmful pests on live plants. In the European Union (EU), all consignments of live plants must be inspected at the first point of entry, and plants allowed entry can be moved without further inspection among the 28 Member States and Switzerland. It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that < 1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the inspection increased with lot size, but {{the probability that the}} infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0. 95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0. 6 in the other countries. We suggest that the EU Member States adopt common maximum acceptable infestation levels and harmonized, statistics-based sampling protocols for plants for planting.

However, many commentators have pointed out the enormity and complexity of this task as well as the political, economic and constitutional hurdles to legislative reform. For plant biosecurity, a crucial issue taken into account when shaping the current EU plant health regime through the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC ('Plant Health Directive') was the need to embrace the single market. Furthermore, the UK was influential in safeguarding plant health in the single market through the adoption of this Directive. The impact of Brexit on protection from invasive species damaging habitats and wildlife (EU Regulation 1143 / 2014) should also be considered. With the Brexit White Paper published and with the Article 50 Bill passing through Parliament, the following questions should be asked: •	Will Directives as well as EU Regulations be included in Great Repeal Bill? •	If so, will Directive 2000 / 29 /EC be regarded as 'unnecessary' given UK’s likely departure from the single market and what might replace it? •	Will existing rulings of the ECJ be taken into account in implementation of laws originating from the EU? •	Will risks of <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> and invasive species increase or lessen if the UK’s borders retract to her national boundaries? •	What will happen with plant passporting? It will also be necessary {{to take into account the}} impact of Brexit on legislation on plant protection products/pesticides because plant health is a component of the EU Farm-to-Fork food safety strategy. Consequently, another question to be addressed is: •	Will the UK continue to implement the farm-to-fork strategy after Brexit strategy or will it be abandoned in favour of a narrower sectoral approach...|$|E
40|$|Vessels need {{ballast water}} {{to ensure their}} {{stability}} and manoeuvrability during their port and sailing operations when un-laden. Ballast water contains sediments, organisms and pathogens, which are transferred from one geographic location to another. Therefore, vessels are {{considered one of the}} primary pathways for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> aquatic <b>organisms</b> and pathogens. The D- 2 regulation of the Ballast Water Management Convention allows the ships to discharge less organisms than specified in the D- 2 standard to prevent its spread, transfer and the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmful</b> aquatic <b>organisms</b> and pathogens around the globe. The Convention also requires inspections in order to verify vessels compliance with the requirements. Inspectors can take samples of the ballast water in order to perform a biological sample analysis test using indicative instruments, or to conduct a detailed test. We reviewed the possible methods of taking a representative sample of the ballast water for monitoring compliance with the Convention, and the indicative sample analysis tools. The key objective of this diploma was to evaluate the appropriateness of the selected tool Walz Water PAM for indicative analysis, which is used to identify living phytoplankton cells.

Two operational tools are presented: a checklist for evaluating a proposed risk reduction option (RRO) and a database of references corresponding to published guidance documents or experimental assessments of RROs. The checklist can be used by the Panel or the dossier-submitting parties to verify whether all required information is provided in support of a RRO, to quickly describe information supplied to EFSA and to identify major gaps in the data. Four types of RRO assessments are distinguished in the proposed checklist according to their purposes and characteristics: experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under laboratory/controlled conditions; experimental assessment of the effectiveness of the option to reduce pest infestation in plant material/products under operational conditions; analysis of the applicability of the RRO; and assessment of the effectiveness of the option {{to reduce the risk of}} pest entry from an infested area to a pest-free area.
