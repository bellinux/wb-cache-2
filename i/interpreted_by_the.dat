5|$|Vasile Kogălniceanu, the {{youngest}} son, was noted for {{his involvement in}} agrarian and left-wing politics during the early 20th century. A founder of Partida Țărănească (which served as an inspiration for the Peasants' Party after 1918), he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest. A manifesto to the peasants, issued by him just before the Peasants' Revolt of 1907, was <b>interpreted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> authorities as a call to rebellion, and led to Kogălniceanu's imprisonment for a duration of five months. A member of the Chamber of Deputies for Ilfov County, {{he served as a}} rapporteur for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Americans like William Billings were {{establishing}} a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using {{a broad array of}} music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, <b>interpreted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E
5|$|The {{killings in}} the Slunj pocket, {{including}} those in Saborsko, were prosecuted by the ICTY. The ICTY charged Babić and Milan Martić, respectively the defence and interior ministers of the SAO Krajina, with persecution, extermination and murder of non-Serb civilians in the area as well as deportations and forcible transfer of the civilian population, intentional plunder and destruction of property. Babić was tried at the ICTY in 2003–05, {{convicted and sentenced to}} 13 years in prison. Martić was tried in 2002–08, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. His involvement in the killings, among other charges brought forward by the ICTY, was <b>interpreted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tribunal as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs from SAO Krajina controlled areas.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be <b>interpreted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
