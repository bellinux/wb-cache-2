5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> of the water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia {{are the only two}} countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.|$|E

25|$|In rural areas, fights {{are often}} staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, {{abandoned}} buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, {{or in the}} streets. Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, one dog dies, or one dog <b>jumps</b> <b>out</b> of the pit. The loser, if not killed in the fight, is typically killed by the owner through a gun, beatings, or torture, in fights run by criminal gangs in the U.S. However, sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner. For instance, the dog's owner may call the fight. Dog fighting generates revenue from stud fees, admission fees and gambling. It is also a felony in all 50 U.S. {{states as well as}} the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.|$|E
