25|$|As {{with the}} KR, {{customers}} began {{asking for a}} street-legal XR from its debut. Harley-Davidson was slow to capitalize on this demand, finally introducing the Sportster XR-1000 street bike 13 years after the XR-750 racer. The XR-1000 used XR-750 heads, but kept the Sportster <b>engine,</b> <b>frame</b> and other equipment. Costing nearly twice {{the price of a}} base model Sportster XL, the XR-1000 sold poorly and many performance enthusiasts simply bought an XL and upgraded the heads, carburetors and exhaust themselves at significantly less total cost. The XR-1000 was discontinued after only two years, and after another 13 years the Harley-Davidson XR1200 was introduced in 2008 in Europe and 2009 in the US. The XR1200 has less in common with the XR-750 than the XR-1000 did, but has so far found a warmer reception.|$|E

2500|$|Beyer, Peacock built three 4-6-2+2-6-4 NZR G class {{locomotives}} in 1928, {{which were}} too powerful {{for the system}} and had complicated valve mechanisms. Unusually, these engines had three cylinders (2416.5in) each, on two sets of engine frames, thus creating a six-cylinder Garratt; they were the second and final Garratts to employ this arrangement, the other being the aforementioned LNER U1. They entered service in 1929. Walschaerts valve gear operated the outside cylinders with the inner third cylinder linked by a Gresley conjugated valve gear. Photos verify the coal bunker was carried on an extension to the boiler frame {{rather than on the}} rear <b>engine</b> <b>frame,</b> as with most Garratts. The engines delivered [...] of tractive effort, which was too powerful for the drawbars on the rolling stock. After a few years they were rebuilt as six Pacifics, also unsuccessful, but which saw nearly twenty years of service.|$|E
50|$|All {{thirteen}} locomotives {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14CR. Only slight alterations {{were necessary to}} the <b>engine</b> <b>frames.</b> With the new boilers, the side running boards and platforms were attached to the <b>engine</b> <b>frames</b> instead of to the boilers as in the original design. In the process, the boiler pitch was raised from 7 ft to 8 ft, which raised the chimney height from 12 ft to 13 ft. This exceeded the loading gauge height of 13 ft above the railhead.|$|R
25|$|J512 {{is owned}} by Seymour Railway Heritage Centre and is pending restoration. As part of the restoration, it has {{converted}} from broad to standard gauge. As of March 2010, the <b>engine</b> <b>frames</b> have been converted.|$|R

2500|$|The wing {{structure}} was wooden with two spruce box spars which were parallel in the centre sections but converged outboard. The leading edge was plywood skinned, as were other stressed areas, {{and the rest}} fabric covered. The CAMS 110's twin push-pull configuration [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs liquid-cooled V12 engines were enclosed within a single nacelle together with the radiator and mounted close to {{the underside of the}} upper wing on two streamlined duralumin N-form struts from the lower wing roots, assisted by transverse X-struts. Short, outward-leaning struts from the <b>engine</b> <b>frame</b> supported the centre of the upper wing and N-form struts braced the lower centre section to the fuselage. The forward propeller was well ahead of the leading edge but the rear one was close to the trailing edge. The upper centre section housed both fuel and oil tanks, with more fuel stored in the lower centre section.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the class}} survived the cutter's torch, {{although}} their size and configuration would have made them an ideal choice for use on heritage railways. However, four BR standard class 2 2-6-0 locomotives – the tender-equipped equivalent – did survive, and one of these, 78059, is being rebuilt into 2-6-2T [...] "84030". This takes the next number in the original series. 78059 was chosen primarily because it lost its tender while at Woodham Brothers scrapyard, Barry. Further reasons cited by the Bluebell Railway, where 78059 is based, are the suitability of the locomotive class for the railway's service trains, and because the tender version {{of the class}} was never allocated to the Southern Region, and hence the tank version (which was allocated there) is far more appropriate for the Bluebell's Southern Region location. As of 2013, 78059 was considered to no longer exist, as the fitting of the hind <b>engine</b> <b>frame</b> extensions have turned it into 84030.|$|E

50|$|The Nu.D.38 was {{powered by}} two 160 hp (120 kW) Bramo Sh 14-A4 radial engines, mounted {{to the main}} wing spar on steel frames. It had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage. A main shock absorber leg was attached {{to each of the}} steel <b>engine</b> <b>frames,</b> braced rearwards by a short auxiliary strut. Legs and wheels were enclosed in fairings.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, New Zealand Government Railways {{obtained}} {{and operated}} three unusual Garratt locomotives in the 4-6-2 + 2-6-4 layout from Beyer, Peacock and Company of the United Kingdom. These engines had three cylinders (16.5 x 24 in) {{on each of}} the two set of <b>engine</b> <b>frames,</b> thus creating a 6-cylinder Garratt. The engines entered service in 1929.|$|R

50|$|The main cradle {{frame was}} carried on {{adjustable}} pivots. The front pivot was a spherical type, {{located on the}} front <b>engine</b> unit's <b>frame</b> between the driving and trailing coupled wheels, while the rear pivot was a flat oil-bath type, located on the rear <b>engine</b> unit's <b>frame</b> over the driving wheels. Each <b>engine</b> unit’s <b>frames</b> were formed of two continuous bars, 33 ft long and extending from the buffer beams at the outer ends to the cross-beams over the Bissel wheels at the inner ends. The front engine unit was equipped with steam as well as vacuum brake gear, while the hind unit was equipped with steam brake gear and handbrake gear.|$|R
50|$|All twenty {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14CR. Only slight alterations {{were necessary to}} the <b>engine</b> <b>frames.</b> In the process, the boiler pitch was raised from 7 ft to 8 ft, which raised the chimney height from 12 ft to 13 ft. This exceeded the loading gauge height of 13 ft above the railhead.|$|R
2500|$|Sadly, this engine {{appears to}} have largely {{been a victim of}} impatience {{on the part of the}} road's president, Leland Stanford. A {{locomotive}} this size had never been constructed before and proved to be a unique engineering challenge. For example, the <b>engine's</b> <b>frame</b> alone was so large, that it had to be cast in two separate sections instead of all at once as with other locomotives built at Sacramento.|$|R
5000|$|Reduced engine weight - The {{mass of the}} {{connecting}} rods and overall materials used in building the <b>engine</b> <b>frame</b> is reduced, which helps the engine gain better power and fuel efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Nineteen of {{the second}} batch locomotives, all except no. 1891, were {{eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14CR. Only slight alterations were necessary to the <b>engine</b> <b>frames.</b> In the process, the boiler pitch was raised from 7 ft to 8 ft. This raised the chimney height from 12 ft to 13 ft and exceeded the loading gauge height of 13 ft above the railhead.|$|R
50|$|The second series used a wider <b>engine</b> case. <b>Frames</b> were {{modified}} {{with experience}} derived from Bruno Spaggiari's Ducati factory racing motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} horizontally {{and outside the}} <b>engine</b> <b>frame.</b> The slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson's Link motion. The engine's boiler barrel setions were not arranged telescopically, but were jointed end-to-end with butt straps.|$|E
50|$|The FZ6 in 2006 has {{a revised}} <b>engine,</b> <b>frame,</b> subframe, grabhandle, rear {{swingarm}} and wheels are painted in black. It had a metal honeycomb type catalytic converter satisfies EU2 and CARB emissions standards, and optimized fuel injection (FI) system mapping to increase torque at lower engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|Nvidia and AMD video {{adapters}} {{provide an}} 'Adaptive Vsync' option. This will only turn on vertical synchronization when the frame {{rate of the}} software exceeds the display's refresh rate, disabling it otherwise.

50|$|All twenty {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14CR. Only slight alterations {{were necessary to}} the <b>engine</b> <b>frames.</b> In the process, the boiler pitch was raised from 7 ft to 8 ft, which raised the chimney height from 12 ft to 13 ft and exceeded the loading gauge height of 13 ft above the railhead. The only other engine on which reboilering resulted in the exceeding of the height restriction was the Class 15BR.|$|R
5000|$|The Bissel truck {{also helps}} {{stabilize}} a train in a turn, where centrifugal force causes a locomotive to lean {{away from the}} track. It features a pair of inclined planes which mate with an opposing set on the <b>engine's</b> <b>frame</b> where the two join. The more a truck moves to the side, the greater the lift {{to the outside of}} the locomotive, canting it slightly into the curve. Though the system was effective, casting and machining its sloping surfaces was expensive.|$|R
50|$|A refinement, the Hudson-Bissell truck, {{delivered}} {{the same result}} using less costly components. Instead of resting upon opposing planes, the <b>engine</b> <b>frame</b> is joined to the truck by two swing links. As the truck pivots sideways {{the outside of the}} locomotive is elevated, a practical modification used right to the end of steam.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1939, the James F Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation of the United States {{conducted}} a worldwide competition for papers on new applications of electric welding. Mills won the £1,000 first prize in the Railway Locomotive section for his {{design of a}} welded <b>engine</b> <b>frame.</b> In 1940 he was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a round-topped firebox. The cylinders were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the <b>engine</b> <b>frame,</b> while the slide valves were actuated by Stephenson Link motion. The cab {{sides of the}} early locomotives were not enclosed, but were equipped with canvas roller blinds to offer the crew some protection against the elements.|$|E
50|$|The Honda 500 {{twins are}} {{a series of}} straight-twin {{motorcycles}} made by Honda since 2013. They are the CB500F standard/naked bike, the CBR500R sport bike, and the CB500X adventure touring bike. Their introduction coincided with new European licensing regulations establishing a mid-range class of motorcycles of limited power. The new 500 twins are similar to the earlier CB500 parallel-twins discontinued in 2003, but with new <b>engines,</b> <b>frames,</b> and other parts. They are made in Thailand, where Honda had previously only made smaller displacement motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The main {{connecting}} rod {{is a large}} triangular frame, driven by both cylinders and driving the crankpin. Owing to the phase difference between the cylinders, this frame tilts {{back and forth as}} the engine rotates and so the cylinder crossheads drive it through two short {{connecting rod}}s, allowing for some movement side-to-side. A large rocking lever attached to the <b>engine's</b> <b>frame</b> holds the connecting rod roughly central. On the Bolton engine, this lever is extended past the frame and used to drive the condenser air pump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inclines}} {{were below}} 1.8% and the curves had radii of 717 ft. The rail weights ranged between 75-90 lb/yard (37.5-45 kg/metre) similar to most trunk lines. Even so, the order for two Baldwin 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives {{included the following}} caution: [...] "Engine frames to be extra heavy throughout. <b>Engine</b> <b>frames</b> to be designed to withstand rough usage and considerable lateral thrust, which will be continually in evidence given that the road is all curves, there being only one tangent track which is a mile long." ...|$|R
