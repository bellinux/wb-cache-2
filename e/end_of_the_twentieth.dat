In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived {{much better than the}} control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer.

50|$|It {{was from}} this root that Stanisław Wyspiański's art arose.

His works, born of Romantic and symbolic inspiration, conjoining Catholic, pagan, and classic traditions with the existential {{and political problems}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new century, has not been completely discovered and understood to this day, forming a vivid and fascinating heritage. It was to this tradition that <b>the</b> originators <b>of</b> Polish monumental theatre, Leon Schiller (Edward Gordon Craig's collaborator), Juliusz Osterwa, and Wilam Horzyca, harked back. Tadeusz Kantor, the avant-garde visual artist who became interested in theatre while trying to find new forms of expression, also alluded to it in his theatrical searches. After years of investigation (attempts to adapt <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> Tachism and performance art to <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theatre), Kantor created his own model, called <b>the</b> Theatre <b>of</b> Death. In his most famous productions - The Dead Class, Wielopole, Wielopole or I Shall Never Return - the artist presented a kind of spiritualist séance, calling pictures, words and sounds deformed by <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> time.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} historical comparison between German-Jewish literature around 1900 and contemporary German ‘literature of migration’. At both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century, the German public debate {{is characterized by}} comparably polarizing discourses on identity, and by increasing hostility toward religious or cultural minorities – Jews at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, and immigrants in the final decades. In the decades after the German Reichsgründung, the so-called Jewish Question became a central element in the debate on German nationhood, and became particularly urgent when {{a large group of}} orthodox Eastern Jews migrated westward, which fueled anti-Semitic sentiments even further, and heightened <b>the</b> self-awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acculturated Jews already living in Central Europe. Since <b>the</b> final decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century, especially since the foreign recruitment agreements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970 s, Germany has struggled with its status as a country of immigration – a status that is acknowledged officially today, but which has traveled a complex legal and political path, and continues to stir up the emotions. That polarized and hostile climate offers fertile literary ground. Countless writers have disclosed in varied and original ways <b>the</b> subtleties <b>of</b> cultural identity, assimilation, normative culture, stereotype, and exclusion. The central research question of this dissertation is how German-Jewish and ‘new’ German writers approach <b>the</b> delicate issue <b>of</b> identity in a social climate where minority groups are consistently portrayed as cultural ‘Others’, and where these writers are often received as ‘not quite German’. A comparative close reading of a selection of texts demonstrates that, in a context of intense identity discourses and perceived threat to ‘German’ culture, literary authors re-enter into a dialogue with the Enlightenment. That dialogue involves not a return to but a re-evaluation of its premise, i. e. <b>the</b> humanistic ideal <b>of</b> self-cultivation and <b>the</b> insistence on autonomy as preconditions of a society of equal individuals. In a variety <b>of</b> themes <b>the</b> texts reveal the wavering confidence in the enlightened individualism that underpins assimilation/integration narratives. At the same time, they draw <b>the</b> contours <b>of</b> unexpected, tentative, and ephemeral forms of intimacy that resist <b>the</b> embrace <b>of</b> collective identity as well. These non-foundational experiences of community are illustrated in reference to <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> Jean-Luc Nancy, and investigated from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> three particular figures: the aesthete, the city dweller, and the family hero. A comparative reading of four texts by Arthur Schnitzler, Navid Kermani, Richard Beer-Hofmann, and Feridun Zaimoglu explores <b>the</b> erosion <b>of</b> assimilation narratives through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aesthete. Presenting aestheticism as <b>the</b> dead <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Bildung, these novels criticize radical assimilation as a process of self-aestheticization leading to self-commodification. At the same time, the novels outline the aesthete’s ‘conversion’ to experiences of kinship and genealogical awareness. A comparison of texts by Ludwig Jacobowski, Terézia Mora, Franz Hessel, and Emine S. Özdamar investigates the metropolitan experience at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. <b>The</b> city is imagined as a site of recalibration, as an ambivalent space where <b>the</b> futility <b>of</b> emancipatory effort is exposed, but where <b>the</b> erosion <b>of</b> individualism engenders vulnerability and intimacy as well. The four city dwellers discussed here illustrate that neither radical individualism, nor collectivism can lay claim to the city. The final chapter discusses four family (hi) stories by Joseph Roth, Dimitré Dinev, and Zsuzsa Bánk – authors who write against <b>the</b> backdrop <b>of</b> disintegrating empires. <b>The</b> intertwining narratives <b>of</b> family and imperial history expose the fissures in <b>the</b> smooth surface <b>of</b> imperial myth. Through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family hero, the texts imagine <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> singular voices from the ‘collective individual’ produced by imperial or communist regimes, and from the silence imposed on individuals by those regimes and by insistent modernity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{have become}} {{particularly}} adept at killing people in <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. Weapons have become ever more destructive, and {{we seem to}} have an increased willingness to use them. From World War I until the more recent conflict in Kuwait, it seems as though warfare has become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. <b>The</b> moral question <b>of</b> modern war is whether it can ever be justified. Since the sixteenth century, moralists have invoked a set of criteria, jus ad bellum, which assesses <b>the</b> morality <b>of</b> intiating war. This dissertation focuses upon <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century papal analysis of jus ad bellum. <b>The</b> morality <b>of</b> war is, for these popes, best understood within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a social theology. War, as one action of a state, cannot be understood apart from a consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundation and <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> human community. Such a vision requires not only a proper concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human person, and his or her relationship to God, but also an appreciation for <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> government in realizing <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> human community. <b>The</b> <b>twentieth</b> century popes have concentrated upon two criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jus ad bellum: just cause and legitimate authority. In <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> just cause, <b>the</b> popes argue that self-defense, in strictly limited circumstances, is the only possible just cause for war. In this context, they also express grave doubts concerning <b>the</b> proportionality <b>of</b> modern weapons. In terms of legitimate authority, they argue that the decision to wage war is justified only in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state in <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common good. At its best, they argue, war will preserve a just society, but will not create it. It is <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> this dissertation that <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century popes believe that warfare, although regrettable, is sometimes necessary to defend one 2 ̆ 7 s nation against aggression. While condemning the social conditions which lead to warfare, they believe that one may not absolutely proscribe its use. At the same time, they insist that states have an obligation to create a community in which the recourse to war is more and more unlikely...|$|R
