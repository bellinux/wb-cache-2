5|$|Every year <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{more and}} more {{difficult}} for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E
5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This {{does not mean that the}} traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E
5|$|Quyllur Rit'i also attracts {{visitors}} {{from outside the}} Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} middle-class mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims. There has also been a rapid {{growth in the number of}} North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> too commercialized. The pilgrimage and associated festival were inscribed in 2011 on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation of planetary systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E

25|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet is a {{diet that}} causes ketosis, a state {{in which there is}} an increased amount of ketones in the body. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly popular for treating intractable epilepsy.|$|E

25|$|Before DNA sequencing, the {{taxonomy}} was confused {{about whether to}} treat these as species or subspecies. Also, numerous subgenera have been proposed for splitting out of Chaetodon, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> clear how to subdivide the genus if that is desired.|$|E
25|$|While {{the dragon}} has often served as China's {{national}} symbol, internationally the giant panda appears {{at least as}} commonly. As such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> widely used within China in international contexts, for example {{as one of the}} five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} P. aeruginosa uses an exoenzyme, ExoU, which degrades {{the plasma}} membrane of eukaryotic cells, leading to lysis. Increasingly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{recognized that the}} iron-acquiring siderophore, pyoverdine, also functions as a toxin by removing iron from mitochondria, inflicting damage on this organelle.|$|E
50|$|Even though Mendeleev {{had left}} the {{necessary}} gap for gallium {{as well as other}} elements, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> clear there <b>was</b> an entire group that was missing altogether.|$|R

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{increasingly}} common to replace esti-plus-adjective with a verb: la ĉielo estas blua or la ĉielo bluas (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical {{change in the}} language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{magnetic}} {{methods have}} been established as a successful way of measuring the degree of pollution in air, water and soil. Environmental magnetism is sensitive to particle size, and has proven effective even at low detection levels. For these reasons, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more widely used.|$|E
25|$|The above {{methods are}} not {{mutually}} exclusive. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, {{when the}} acronym was changed, the {{organization}} decided that DECA {{would no longer}} stand for [...] "Distributive Educational Clubs of America" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> international.|$|R

25|$|The {{topography}} of Santa Maria is generally flat, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> hilly towards the north. This area covers the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Pulong Buhangin and {{some parts of}} Balasing with landscape ranging from 8 to 18 percent slope. The rest of the barangays have a slope range from level to undulating.|$|E
25|$|Today the Junior {{program is}} {{starting}} to grow. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> a very strong team through the support of several Detroit area high schools. They have become increasingly successful in recent years. In 2005, the Detroit Boat Club had the largest presence at the USRowing Youth Invitational in Cincinnati, OH.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of Availability based tariff {{has brought about}} stability {{to a great extent}} in the Indian transmission grids. However, presently <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> outdated in a power surplus grid. A report in 2005 suggested that there was room for improvement in terms of the efficiency of electricity generation in India, and suggested that two factors possibly responsible for the inefficiency were public ownership of utilities and low capacity utilisation.|$|E

25|$|The Czech coup, the PCF's failed {{policy of}} {{sabotage}} and the Marshall Plan's likely passage were all beginning to sway French public opinion. 70% of French people now believed the U.S. {{would do more}} than any other country to help France, compared to 7% who thought the USSR would do more. Despite French concern about Germany, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly clear that the Soviet threat was greater than the German. France would still seek an advantageous power position vis-à-vis Germany, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> reconciled to the prospect of a rehabilitated Germany as part of postwar Europe.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the latter}} 1930s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> {{inevitable}} that a Second World War with Germany was coming. On 3 September 1939 following Germany's invasion of Poland, Neville Chamberlain announced war on Nazi Germany.|$|R
25|$|The used test {{equipment}} market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically {{has a wide}} selection of older analog scopes available. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used instruments are usually out of calibration, and recalibration by companies with the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|These other forms, {{particularly}} the last, are becoming less common {{as they are}} increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife {{is expected to take}} her husband's name but not the other way around). Additionally, in Spain and some other countries <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.|$|E
25|$|The {{progressively}} more severe reports and estimates of event probability and consequences have awakened a broad interest in training people for emergency response. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> widely understood that professional fire fighting, police, and medical {{services will be}} overwhelmed by a major event and that neighbors will have to assist each other as best they can. Appropriate area response organizations would likely {{be similar to the}} 1950s civil defense structure, but such civilian participation has yet to be organized.|$|E
