40|$|It is {{an honor}} to be invited to write about Judge Robert H. Bork 2 ̆ 7 s {{contributions}} to antitrust law. It is also a pleasure to join in paying tribute to <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s work. When I joined the faculty at Yale, <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> was a colleague, though I did not get to know him then. But when <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> left Yale, I inherited his antitrust course. At Yale Law School at least (and only so far as the classroom), I am <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s successor. Despite all of the horrible things that <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> continues to say about the Yale Law School (he has recently added the Yale Club to the list), he remains an important and dominant presence there today. Intellectually, I {{would like to think that}} my antitrust class closely resembles the course that he taught or would be teaching if he had stayed. But <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> has a continuing presence in a different sense. Antitrust remains a popular course, drawing 60 to 80 students per year, which is a very large class by Yale Law School standards. Indeed, the Law School possesses only two or three classrooms that can accommodate that number. In the room in which I typically teach the class, on the back wall directly facing the instructor, and looking over the shoulders of every student, is a large portrait of <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork.</b> It is an excellent portrait, though perhaps emphasizing <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s sternness and seriousness more than his wonderful sense of humor. The presence of the portrait, however, has two effects on the class. First, it keeps the instructor on track. If I were even to entertain the suggestion that something in an antitrust opinion, say, of Justice William O. Douglas, made any sense, a quick glance at the portrait would immediately disabuse me of the thought. The second effect is on the students. Many students, at least at the beginning of the course, will present arguments based on concepts of the existence of barriers to entry, of the ability of a firm with market power to leverage that power from one market to another, or of harms related to foreclosure. To deal with arguments of this nature, all the instructor needs to do is to ask students making such contentions to look over their shoulders at <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s portrait. What, in any other light, is a serious portrait becomes a scowling portrait, and has a wonderful effect on performance and understanding in the class. <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s influence on the understanding of antitrust law will be sustained at Yale Law School for many generations into the future...|$|E
40|$|The late Judge Robert H. Bork {{is usually}} remembered as an eminent jurist and scholar {{in the fields}} of {{antitrust}} law and constitutional law. His judicial opinions and his writings, especially The Antitrust Paradox 1 and The Tempting of America, 2 are certainly standards in these areas. <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork,</b> however, also deserves acclaim for his contributions to other fields of law. One extremely important subject, in which Judge Bork’s judicial work has received little attention, is the law pertaining to national security and U. S. foreign relations. This essay discusses Judge Bork’s opinions in four important D. C. Circuit cases: Demjanjuk v. Meese, 3 Persinger v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 4 Finzer v. Barry, 5 and Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic. 6 In these cases, <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> identified and followed nine very traditional principles of law concerning national security and foreign relations. These principles were so clear and well-established that at the time they seemed unremarkable. Indeed, while scrutinizing nearly every other aspect of Judge Bork’s records, proponents and opponents of his nomination to the Supreme Court said very little about his opinions in these cases. How <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> addressed the law in the area of national security and U. S. foreign relations is a subject that deserves a fresh look in light of important Supreme Court litigation arising out of the War on Terror. In a series of cases, often decided by the narrowest of margins, Justices of the Supreme Court have effectively rejected each of the nine traditional principles that <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> applied in his D. C. Circuit opinions. Contrasting the Supreme Court’s controversial decisions in these cases to Judge Bork’s very different and more restrained approach reveals another aspect of what was lost when the Senate failed to confirm Judge Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987...|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court {{nomination}} and confirmation process {{has become one}} of the most contentious aspects of American politics in recent years, representing a seismic struggle between the president and the U.

As such, we examine the president’s public expenditure of capital to obtain confirmation for Supreme Court nominees facing a Senate that is reticent to confirm.

40|$|It is not... easy to {{see what}} the shock-the-conscience test adds, or should be allowed to add, to the {{deterrent}} function of exclusionary rules. Where no deterrence of unconstitutional police behavior is possible, a decision to exclude probative evidence with the result that a criminal goes free to prey upon the public should shock the judicial conscience even more than admitting the evidence. So spoke Judge Robert H. Bork, concurring in a ruling that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to foreign searches conducted exclusively by foreign officials. A short time thereafter, when an interviewer read back the above statement and invited him to comment further on the subject, <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> responded: [One of the reasons] sometimes given [in support of the exclusionary rule] is that courts shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t soil their hands by allowing in unconstitutionally acquired evidence. I have never been convinced by that argument because it seems the conscience of the court ought to be at least equally shaken by the idea of turning a criminal loose upon society. <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> displays no affection for the exclusionary rule, but he may not be making an affirmative case against it. All he may be saying is that whatever good reasons may exist for excluding illegally seized evidence, the 2 ̆ 2 judges shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t soil their hands 2 ̆ 2 argument isn 2 ̆ 7 t one of them. On the other hand, Bork may be implying something more - or at least a reader may understandably infer something more: Where the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct is more reprehensible than the police officer 2 ̆ 7 s (as, of course, it usually will be), the 2 ̆ 2 judges shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t soil their hands 2 ̆ 2 argument is a good reason for admitting illegally seized evidence. For 2 ̆ 2 judges soil their hands 2 ̆ 2 a good deal more by 2 ̆ 2 turning a criminal loose upon society 2 ̆ 2 than they do by simply ignoring an officer 2 ̆ 7 s violation of the fourth amendment. To put it somewhat differently, if the admissibility of illegally seized evidence turns solely on how the ruling affects the judge 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 conscience, 2 ̆ 2 the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s motion to suppress should almost always fail.

40|$|This Essay {{examines}} 2 ̆ 2 The Tempting of America 2 ̆ 2 {{in three}} stages: Section II briefly summarizes the major {{themes of the}} book along three principal lines that parallel the book 2 ̆ 7 s three parts: Bork 2 ̆ 7 s critique of the Supreme Court, his concept of correct and incorrect legal theory and his assessment of the treatment he received from {{the media and the}} Senate Judiciary Committee.

Section III examines problems that Bork 2 ̆ 7 s judicial philosophy raises from the perspectives of history, jurisprudence, and, most especially, the practice of viewing jurisprudence from alternative and competitive perspectives. The pervasive question in Section III is whether Bork is fully aware of these problems and whether he has adequately and fairly addressed them. Section IV attempts to relate Bork 2 ̆ 7 s judicial philosophy to the underlying purpose of 2 ̆ 2 The Tempting of America 2 ̆ 2 which explores 2 ̆ 2 who we are and how we live. 2 ̆ 2 This section suggests a comparison between Bork 2 ̆ 7 s metaphor of 2 ̆ 2 heresy 2 ̆ 2 as diagnostic of current judicial problems and Ronald Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s metaphor, 2 ̆ 2 the protestant attitude, 2 ̆ 2 as characteristic of a healthy legal culture.

40|$|Part I of this Article {{summarizes}} the relevant {{provisions of the}} Tucker Act, and examines courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of whether a district court had jurisdiction over a claim when a potential judgment exceeded 10, 000. This Article suggests that, over time, traditional Tucker Act jurisdiction has been distorted {{by the appearance of}} a new kind of plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 seeking 2 ̆ 2 structural reform 2 ̆ 2 rather than the kinds of compensation envisioned by the Act. This Article also suggests that Tucker Act jurisdiction has been distorted by two congressional actions: the creation of the judgment fund; and amendments to the Administrative Procedure Act. These congressional actions could be construed to extend district court jurisdiction over claims for money damages. As a result, the distinction between Tucker and non- Tucker Act remedies has been blurred. Part II of this Article explicates the case law before and after the passage of the APA and its relevant amendments. This Article notes how, in the 19802 ̆ 7 s, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began to assert that state suits against the Federal Government seeking reimbursement of grant-in-aid funds should be treated as Tucker Act claims and tried in the United States Claims Court, rather than as non-Tucker Act claims to be tried in the district courts. Although the DOJ achieved some measure of success, <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork,</b> in a masterful display of judicial legerdemain, offered alternative reasoning which became the basis for the Bowen decision.

40|$|My article {{concerns}} constitutional {{interpretation and}} substantive due process, issues that {{played a central}} role in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), one of the two same-sex marriage cases. (The other same-sex marriage case was United States v. Windsor (2013).) -/- The late Justice Scalia consistently maintained that the Court “invented” substantive due process and continues to apply this legal “fiction” not because the Constitution supports it but simply because the justices like it. Two theories underlay his cynical conclusion. First is the theory of “Constitutional Textualism”—or just plain “Textualism”—which says that the meaning of the Constitution lies entirely within the “four corners” of the document. Second is the theory of “Originalism,” which says that this meaning was fixed at the time of ratification. (Likewise, the meanings of the amendments were fixed at the time of their ratification.) -/- While Justice Scalia helped to inspire a Textualist/Originalist (and anti-substantive-due-process) movement, his Originalism has received far more attention than his Textualism. Since Judge Robert Bork first introduced Originalism to the general public during his Supreme Court nomination hearings in 1987, this theory has ignited passions on all sides and effectively re-framed the entire debate about how to interpret the Constitution. Constitutional scholars, left and right, now define themselves as either for or against Originalism. Meanwhile, Textualism has merely retreated into the background. -/- Part of the reason for this disparate treatment is that many who reject Originalism still consider themselves to be Textualists. They agree with Justice Scalia (and <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork)</b> that the text is all-important. They disagree, however, that its meaning was fixed for eternity at ratification. Instead, they maintain that either the meaning of the text or applications of this meaning to new cases can change as society changes. -/- In this Article, I bring Textualism out of Originalism’s shadow and into broad daylight. I argue that once we dig just a little deeper into the proposition that all of the meaning in the Constitution inheres in its words, we find that this theory simply cannot work. In order to interpret the nation’s foundational document, we must resort to assumptions that it does not explicitly state. (Indeed, even Textualism itself is a theory that the Constitution does not explicitly endorse.) And the notion that “extra-textual” assumptions necessarily inform our interpretations of the Constitution poses a direct and insurmountable threat to Textualism. -/- The Constitution actually requires each judge, when faced with a case concerning the right to privacy, not merely to consider the text but also to anticipate and evaluate the moral, social, and political consequences of both possible decisions before choosing between them. While this position may initially sound counterintuitive, it turns out to be a much more realistic theory of constitutional interpretation than Textualism (and Originalism). -/- I ultimately conclude that, contrary to Justice Scalia, the Constitution most certainly does protect a right to privacy. For what it’s worth, the Obergefell majority agree with me (and oppose Justice Scalia). I aim to show exactly why they are correct...|$|E

40|$|Robert Bork, former {{judge for}} the District of Columbia Circuit and {{antitrust}} scholar, has characterized {{the social and}} political goals underlying merger law as 2 ̆ 2 pure intellectual mush. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Social and political values have formed the foundation of the most famous United States Supreme Court decisions interpreting section 7 of the Clayton Act, the primary statutory standard for judging the legality of corporate acquisitions. <b>Judge</b> <b>Bork</b> 2 ̆ 7 s dismissive and derogatory comments challenge both judges and scholars to provide a rigorous intellectual foundation and a procedure for incorporating these values into the merger law enforcement process. Current trends in antitrust policy also force decision makers to confront directly whether anything is wrong with mergers other than the potential increase in market power associated with one firm 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of stock or assets of another. The statutory standards in the Clayton Act for judging the legality of mergers have not been amended since 1950, but courts have differed widely in their application of those standards-from the per se, populist approach of the Warren Court to the rule-of-reason, economic efficiency approach of the Burger Court. In the past, proposed amendments to the Clayton Act have recommended prohibiting all mergers between large firms on the grounds that bigness is bad for social and political reasons. The current trend, however, is toward enforcement and statutory amendments based on economic theories that would permit mergers regardless {{of the size of the}} firms involved if the merger would not lead to an excessive increase in market power. The proposed Merger Modernization Act of 1986, reintroduced as part of the omnibus 2 ̆ 2 competitiveness 2 ̆ 2 package of the Reagan administration in 1987 would, by statutory amendment, eliminate from consideration in merger cases all concerns other than those associated with market power. It is important, then, to appreciate the nature or character of those social and political goals not served by an exclusively economic orientation. This focus is likely to continue during the Bush administration. This Article focuses attention on goals other than economic efficiency by contrasting them to economic goals both in terms of their substantive content and their underlying assumptions. Alternative articulations of the nonefficiency goals are examined to state as precisely as possible what legislators, judges, and scholars had in mind when advocating these goals. Although one can easily appreciate the political and social values scholars and policy makers espouse, it is difficult to identify from the current literature in this area either the connection between mergers generally and undesirable consequences or those particular mergers most likely to have unwanted side effects. Although this Article calls for greater specificity and precision by proponents of nonefficiency goals, it also argues that many of these goals can be included systematically in antitrust enforcement. In response to the appeal of social and political values and their established place in antitrust cases, this Article suggests a more dynamic and democratic interpretation of economic efficiency that incorporates a broader spectrum of values...|$|E
