25|$|The quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a {{literary}} and artistic quarrel that heated {{up in the}} early 1690s and shook the Académie française. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (Anciens) who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> of Antiquity and the Moderns (Modernes), who supported {{the merits of the}} authors of the century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle quickly followed with his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.|$|E

Various studies reported significant associations between waiting times and higher mortality and morbidity among those who survived.

25|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have provided}} evidence {{which may be}} taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin, who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the sentence-final particle le. Certain restrictions on movement from within verb phrases preceding such a particle are found (if various other assumptions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> are accepted) {{to be consistent with}} the idea that the verb phrase has moved from its underlying position after its head (the particle le here being taken as the head of an aspect phrase). However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry. More details about these arguments {{can be found in the}} Antisymmetry article.|$|E

At both companies, he began working as an Assistant Director, whose duties could include anything from cleaning floors to shaving actresses {{at a time when it}} was illegal to show even the slightest hint of pubic hair in Japanese media. Ikeda continued as an Assistant Director at Nikkatsu throughout the 1970s in such films as Flower and Snake (1974), Wife to be Sacrificed (1974) and Noble Lady: Bound Vase (1977), all directed by Masaru Konuma.|$|E

500|$|Cho Ki-chon ( [...] ; 6 November 1913– 31 July 1951) was a Russian-born North Korean poet. He is {{regarded}} as a [...] "founding father of North Korean poetry" [...] whose distinct Soviet-influenced style of lyrical epic poetry in the socialist realist genre became an important feature of North Korean literature. He was nicknamed [...] "Korea's Mayakovsky" [...] after the writer whose works had had an influence on him and which implied his breaking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> of the old society and his commitment to communist values.

500|$|In Chinese literature, {{ailanthus}} {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing {{a father and a}} stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
