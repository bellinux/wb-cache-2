A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison</b> proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras.

His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after its}} secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central {{government}} ordered an offensive against it. The offensive, {{planned to be}} the first act of an offensive against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe ("King of the Baluba") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison</b> and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.|$|E
