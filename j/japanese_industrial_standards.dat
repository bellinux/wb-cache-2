The document lists acrylic fiber and nylon as fibers {{that could be used}} in construction of flags used by the military. For acrylic, the red color is 5.7R 3.7/15.5 and white is N9.4; nylon has 6.2R 4/15.2 for red and N9.2 for white. In a document issued by the Official Development Assistance (ODA), the red color for the Hinomaru and the ODA logo is listed as DIC 156 and CMYK 0-100-90-0.

An appearance or a disappearance of the spectrum lines of iron were checked for various concentrations of iron in the samples, metallic zinc, sodium sulfate, or aluminum sulfate. 　From the results of the experiments, the suitable lines to be used for estimating concentrations of iron was selected as the grading lines.
