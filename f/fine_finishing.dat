He helped the club win the 1981 Danish 2nd Division, and secure promotion to the top-flight Danish 1st Division. In 1981, before the 1982 season, he became the first fully professional player in Danish football, when Brøndby chairman Per Bjerregaard offered him a full-time contract. He was Brøndby's topscorer with 13 league goals in the 1983 season, and was called up for the Danish national team in May 1983, by national manager Sepp Piontek. He played seven games in Denmark's unsuccessful qualification campaign for the 1984 Summer Olympics, scoring a goal against Norway.|$|E
50|$|Adrian Gray {{continued}} his <b>fine</b> <b>finishing</b> form with a 160 checkout in an 8-3 win over Sam Rooney.

The final match of the night and the second round saw the lone American left in the competition, Darin Young, face off against Mervyn King. A high-quality match saw 6 180s and three checkouts over 100 from King; in one instance Young performed a 12 darter despite King hitting back-to-back 180s to leave 41 - in the next leg King hit two more 180s making 12 perfect darts in a row. Young held onto the onslaught, levelling the match at 6-6 from 6-4, but King produced 14 and 13 darters to take the match 8-6.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{polishing}} process, {{which is}} the final process in manufacturing optical elements, {{takes a long time}} and often depends on the experience and special skills. Development of a skill-less polishing technology and automation of its process, therefore, has been required. One of the most promising polishing technologies is Field-assisted <b>Fine</b> <b>Finishing</b> (FFF). In this study, an Electro-rheological Gel (ERG) polishing pad with one-sided patterned electrodes is developed to polish insulator materials and, moreover, a novel electric-field-assisted polishing technology for glass polishing is proposed applying this pad. The ERG polishing pad can change the polishing performance according to applied electric field due to “electro-adhesion effect”. Results of several polishing tests show that the performance of polishing a blue glass can be controlled by applying electric field to the ERG pad...|$|E
40|$|In {{the most}} cases {{manufacturing}} of injection mold and its cavities comprise {{more than half}} of the total production time. Very <b>fine</b> <b>finishing</b> operations can increase production time and cost of injection mold. Appropriate choice of finishing operations and injection technological parameters can reduce price of injection mold production, shorten production time and thus lower price of small and thin injection molded parts. Tool material X 38 CrMoV 5 - 1, used for cavity in injection mold, was finished by fine turning, grinding, lapping and polishing with different technological conditions to achieve various surface roughness. The main aim of this research is to find an influence of surface quality of cavity and injection technological parameters on the surface quality of injection molded parts. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|E
