40|$|We {{show that}} Mannheim's {{conformal}} <b>gravity</b> <b>program,</b> whose potential has a term proportional to $ 1 /r$ and another term proportional to $r$, does not reduce to Newtonian gravity at short distances, unless one assumes undesirable singularities {{of the mass}} density of the proton. Therefore, despite the claim that it successfully explains galaxy rotation curves, unless one assumes the singularities, {{it seems to be}} falsified by numerous Cavendish-type experiments performed at laboratories on Earth whose work have not found any deviations from Newton's theory. Moreover, it can be shown {{that as long as the}} total mass of the proton is positive, Mannheim's conformal <b>gravity</b> <b>program</b> leads to negative linear potential, which is problematic from the point of view of fitting galaxy rotation curves, which necessarily requires positive linear potential.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of Euclidean distance, or a geodesic, {{are of course}} suitable models for the practical application of measurement at classical scale. However, it will be argued here that the complete picture of the abstract geometry that intervenes two points necessarily involves a dynamical network of discrete intervals. Then measurement concepts that aim to remain valid at microscopic length scales must take account of dynamical update in that network. The abstract model developed on that basis displays characteristics analogous to quantum mechanical features; then it is proposed for consideration as the ‘very general model’ of interest to quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>programs.</b> This model suggests that the current formulation of classical mathematics is antithetical to the unification <b>program</b> of quantum <b>gravity...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{treatise}} on time and on background independence in physics. It first considers how time is conceived of in each accepted paradigm of physics: Newtonian, special relativity, quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR). Substantial differences are moreover uncovered between {{what is meant by}} time in QM and in GR. These differences jointly source the Problem of Time: Nine interlinked facets which arise upon attempting concurrent treatment of the QM and GR paradigms, as is required in particular for a background independent theory of quantum gravity. A sizeable proportion of current quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>programs</b> - e. g. geometrodynamical and loop quantum gravity approaches to quantum GR, quantum cosmology, supergravity and M-theory - are background independent in this sense. This book's foundational topic is thus furthermore of practical relevance in the ongoing development of quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>programs.</b> This book shows moreover that eight of the nine facets of the Problem of Time already occur upon entertaining background independence in classical (rather than quantum) physics. By this development, and interpreting shape theory as modelling background independence, this book further establishes background independence as a field of study. Background independent mechanics, as well as minisuperspace (spatially homogeneous) models of GR and perturbations thereabout are used to illustrate these points. As hitherto formulated, the different facets of the Problem of Time greatly interfere with each others' attempted resolutions. This book explains how, none the less, a local resolution of the Problem of Time can be arrived at after various reconceptualizations of the facets and reformulations of their mathematical implementation. Self-contained appendices on mathematical methods for basic and foundational quantum gravity are included. Finally, this book outlines how supergravity is refreshingly different from GR as a realization of background independence, and what background independence entails at the topological level and beyond. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{criticism}} sometimes made of {{the causal}} set quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>program</b> {{is that there is}} no practical scheme for identifying manifoldlike causal sets and finding embeddings of them into manifolds. A computational method for constructing an approximate embedding of a small manifoldlike causal set into Minkowski space (or any spacetime that is approximately flat at short scales) is given, and tested in the 2 dimensional case. This method can also be used to determine how manifoldlike a causal set is, and conversely to define scales of manifoldlikeness. In any quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>program</b> in which spacetime is replaced by a discrete structure, it is important to relate continuum approximations to the underlying structures, in order to relate known physics to the new theory (see e. g. [1]). In the causal set program [2], the discrete/continuum correspondence relies on embeddings of the fundamental causal set (or causet – for definitions see [2, 3, 4]) into Lorentzian manifolds, and the concept of sprinkling. A sprinkling is a random selection of points from the manifold made according to a Poisson process – this means that the number of points sprinkled into any regio...|$|E
