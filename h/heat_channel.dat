The channel {{consists of a}} group of noninteracting particles, which move between two heat baths according to some dynamical process.

40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>channel</b> {{is defined}} by a linear {{time-varying}} (LTV) filter with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the filter output. The continuous-time LTV filter {{is related to the}} heat kernel of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, so the name of the channel. The channel's capacity is given in closed form by means of the Lambert W function. Also a waterfilling theorem in the time-frequency plane for the capacity is derived. It relies on a specific Szego theorem for which an essentially self-contained proof is provided. Similarly, the rate distortion function for a related nonstationary source is given in closed form and a (reverse) waterfilling theorem in the time-frequency plane is derived. Finally, a second closed-form expression for the capacity of the <b>heat</b> <b>channel</b> based on the detected perturbed filter output signals is presented. In this context, a precise differential connection between channel capacity and the normalized optimal detection error (NODE) is revealed. This C-NODE relationship is compared with the well-known I-MMSE relationship connecting mutual information with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) of estimation theory.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{accepted}} measurement methodologies for thermal conductivity of a nanofluid. In this study, a flow cell experimental setup (Figure 1) {{was used for}} the evaluation of dynamic thermal conductivity of the nanofluids. This experimental setup allows for the continuous flow of the nanofluid between an insulated heating element and a cooling fan. Two thermoelectric modules were affixed to both walls of the <b>heating</b> <b>channel</b> and connected to a power supply. The power supply created an electric current which increased the temperature of the walls in the <b>heating</b> <b>channel.</b> A dc pump supplied the circulation of the nanofluid within the closed loop under laminar flow conditions, Re < 2, 300. When the nanofluid was passed through the <b>heating</b> <b>channel,</b> it absorbed some of the heat, increasing the temperature of the nanofluid, and then was subsequently cooled back to room temperature by the cooling fan. The temperature of the nanofluid and the walls were monitored by four thermocouples located at the walls and at the inlet and outlet <b>channels</b> of the <b>heating</b> <b>channel.</b> By comparing the steady-state channel wall temperature, the effectiveness of a nanofluid was evaluated.|$|R

In this purpose, after presenting the main motivations for the introduction of these parameters in place of previously proposed ones, additional information on the theoretical bases and on the consequences of this development is provided. Stability maps, generated by an in-house program adapted from a previous application to boiling channels, are also shown for different combinations of the operating parameters. The maps are obtained as contour plots of an amplification parameter obtained from numerical discretization and subsequent linearization of governing equations; as such, they provide a quantitatively clear perspective of the effect of different boundary conditions on the stability of <b>heated</b> <b>channels</b> with supercritical fluids. In order to assess the validity of the assumptions at the basis of the in-house model, supporting calculations have been performed making use of the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 computer code, detecting the values of the dimensionless parameters at the threshold for the occurrence of instability for a <b>heated</b> <b>channel</b> representative of SCWR proposed core configurations.

40|$|All animals need {{to sense}} {{temperature}} to avoid hostile environments and to regulate their internal homeostasis. A particularly obvious example is that animals {{need to avoid}} damagingly hot stimuli. The mechanisms by which temperature is sensed have until recently been mysterious, {{but in the last}} couple of years, we have begun to understand how noxious thermal stimuli are detected by sensory neurons. Heat has been found to open a nonselective cation channel in primary sensory neurons, probably by a direct action. In a separate study, an ion channel gated by capsaicin, the active ingredient of chili peppers, was cloned from sensory neurons. This channel (vanilloid receptor subtype 1, VR 1) is gated by heat in a manner similar to the native heat-activated channel, and our current best guess is that this channel is the molecular substrate for the detection of painful heat. Both the <b>heat</b> <b>channel</b> and VR 1 are modulated in interesting ways. The response of the <b>heat</b> <b>channel</b> is potentiated by phosphorylation by protein kinase C, whereas VR 1 is potentiated by externally applied protons. Protein kinase C is known to be activated by a variety of inflammatory mediators, including bradykinin, whereas extracellular acidification is characteristically produced by anoxia and inflammation. Both modulatory pathways are likely, therefore, to have important physiological correlates in terms of the enhanced pain (hyperalgesia) produced by tissue damage and inflammation. Future work should focus on establishing, in molecular terms, how a single ion channel can detect heat and how the detection threshold can be modulated by hyperalgesic stimuli...|$|E

The proofs of both waterfilling theorems rely on a specific Szego theorem for a positive definite operator associated with the filter.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Natural convective flow through a vertical plane channel has been considered. Both of the heated walls are kept at the same temperature. These heated walls have sharp-edged wavy surfaces. Conditions under which both laminar and turbulent flow exists in the channel have been considered. Now using a wavy heated wall can increase the heat transfer rate in external natural convective flows. Using wavy heated walls in vertical channel flows could therefore potentially also increase the heat transfer rate. However the added flow resistance resulting from the wall waviness will normally decrease the flow through the channel which would tend to decrease the heat transfer rate from the heated walls. Therefore a need existed to examine what effect the wall waviness does have on the heat transfer rate in natural convective flow through a vertical channel and it was {{for this reason that}} the present study was undertaken. The flow has been assumed to be steady and the Boussinesq approximation has been adopted. The basic k-epsilon turbulence model with the effects of the buoyancy forces fully accounted for has been used. The solution has the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, the ratio of channel width to the <b>heated</b> <b>channel</b> height, the ratio of the amplitude of the wall waviness to the <b>heated</b> <b>channel</b> height, and the ratio of the pitch of the wall waviness to the <b>heated</b> <b>channel</b> height as parameters. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74 (the value for air at temperatures near ambient) and for a single value of the dimensionless pitch of the wall waviness. This leaves the Rayleigh number, the width to heated height ratio of the channel, and the amplitude of the wall waviness to the <b>heated</b> <b>channel</b> height ratio as parameters. Results have been obtained for a range of values of these parameters and the effect of these parameters on the mean Nusselt number has been studied. pm 201...|$|R
40|$|As {{proposed}} in the LUCIFER project, ZnSe crystals are attractive materials to realize scintillating bolometers aiming at the search for neutrinoless double beta decay of the promising isotope 82 Se. However, the optimization of the ZnSe-based detectors is rather complex and requires a wide-range investigation of the crystal features: optical properties, crystalline quality, scintillation yields and bolometric behaviour. Samples tested up to now show problems in the reproducibility of crucial aspects of the detector performance.
