500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, [...] "Sony went in a new direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 May 2010, Jágr {{announced}} he was backing the Civic Democrats and its leader Petr Nečas. At the press conference, he said, [...] "I realize {{that there will be}} elections in two to three days. I would like their outcome to be good." [...] He also urged the party not to forget about sports when distributing money. [...] "We all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if the young did not practice any sport. If children practice some sport, they do not have time for other things such as alcohol." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because {{that is one of the}} things you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ye-es; but first, he {{has nothing}} to tell; and secondly, he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took you}} there," [...] Louis continued, [...] "because I knew that some {{time during the}} night Tapilow would come. Already I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if you two met." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, as Paul Krugman notes, ”the ECB’s efforts rely to an {{important}} extent on a bluff, {{in the sense that}} nobody <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if OMT were actually required”.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Lawley. I {{should like}} to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to the country if there weren't {{soldiers}} to protect it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am an old fool--an old fool!' Dragomiroff began piteously. 'I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> It is all new to me. We {{reason with}} them in Little Russia.' ...|$|E
60|$|The bully was frightened, for {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to him if he {{was caught}} by the Rovers and their friends in such a lonely spot as this.|$|E
60|$|I {{paused for}} a bare second to collect my thoughts, so as to put the thing clearly to her. I might have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> She dashed right in and {{collared}} the conversation.|$|R
60|$|Mamie {{was pale}} with apprehension. She knew her Lora Delane Porter, and she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if Steve {{were to be}} {{discovered}} there. It was, as Keggs put it, as much as her place was worth.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hate New York,' {{she said}} getting {{it out at}} last with a rush. 'I'm scared of it. It--it isn't fair Charlie {{bringing}} me here. I didn't want to come. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> I felt it all along.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said, 'Yes, yes!' eagerly, {{and came}} up quite close to the window. I was like a child, and did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> I was anxious to be comforted in my {{helplessness}} and remorse.|$|E
60|$|So he {{went out}} sadly and told his guards that the empress was {{to be buried in}} the earth up to her neck, so that {{everyone}} might <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to those who dared to deceive the emperor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then, don't you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if {{you were}} {{lowering}} that boat full {{of people in a}} rough sea, and the man at the bow failed to unhook his block at the exact same moment as the man at the stern?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{positive}} wealth," [...] Letitia acknowledged, [...] "but I {{am sure you}} don't want me really, and I haven't the least inclination to get married, and heaven <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to dad if I let him go back to bachelor apartments!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I know why," [...] {{interrupted}} Natty indignantly. [...] "That Cockawee {{does nothing}} but upset. She has turned turtle twice {{out in the}} harbour in fine weather. Ford was a rascal to let her to you. He might have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Why--why--it was almost murder to let you go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{might have}} {{expected}} it, I might have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen!</b> Eustace warned me. Eustace was right. He knows women--as I do--now. Women! What mighty ills have not been done by women? Who was't betrayed the what's-its-name? A woman! Who lost ... lost ... who lost ... who-- er--and so on? A woman ... So all is over! There {{is nothing to be}} said but good-bye?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Nothing escapes their notice, sir. And then I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Some of {{them would}} begin {{reflecting}} on me by saying (for they are free) that they never will on any account engage themselves to lovers without polished leather boots. Hark! Miss Twinkleton. I’ll ask for leave.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Hearing this, Francis said good-bye--and {{said nothing}} more. He was ashamed to {{acknowledge}} it to himself, {{but he felt}} an irresistible curiosity to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> when Agnes arrived at the hotel. Besides, 'Mrs. James' had reposed a confidence in him. He got into his gondola, respecting the confidence of 'Mrs. James.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your invitation," [...] I said, [...] "sounds most attractive. But I am {{curious to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{to me in}} the Rue Strelitz. Should I be offered poison in a jewelled cup, or {{disposed}} of in a cruder fashion? Let me make my will first, and I will come. I am really curious!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings, {{published}} by Ballantine Books on October 12, 1978, still {{referred to the}} sequel in the book's inside cover jacket. Bakshi states {{that he would never}} have made the film if he had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> during the production. He is quoted as saying that the reason he made the film was [...] "to save it for Tolkien, because I loved the Rings very much." ...|$|R
5000|$|You {{can imagine}} just how happy we were after the referee blew the final whistle. After the {{catastrophe}} I drove home with Otto Rehhagel {{who was also}} living in Essen at the time. On the way back, {{he said to me}} there would be a new manager the next day. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> and it wasn't even his fault, but Rehhagel would be made the scapegoat to save face for the club. Borussia Dortmund captain Manfred Burgsmüller ...|$|R
60|$|Jet <b>knew</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{the instant}} {{he failed to}} show a bold front, and between two evils be chose the one which seemed the least.|$|R
60|$|That {{the birds}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{if they were}} caught, and are even a little {{undecided}} about which is the better life, is obvious to every student of them. Thus, if you leave your empty perambulator under the trees and watch from a distance, {{you will see the}} birds boarding it and hopping about from pillow to blanket in a twitter of excitement; they are trying to find out how babyhood would suit them.|$|E
6000|$|When first I {{started this}} series with [...] "The Rover Boys at School," [...] I {{had no idea}} of {{extending}} the line beyond three or four volumes. But the second book, [...] "The Rover Boys on the Ocean," [...] immediately called for a third, [...] "The Rover Boys in the Jungle," [...] and this finished, many boys wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> next, and so I must needs give them [...] "The Rover Boys Out West." [...] Still they were not satisfied; hence the volume now in your hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Credulity is {{a curious}} thing," [...] went on Treherne in a low voice. [...] "It is more {{negative}} than positive, {{and yet it is}} infinite. Hundreds of men will avoid walking under a ladder; they don't know where the door of the ladder will lead. They don't really think God would throw a thunderbolt at them for such a thing. They don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> that is just the point; but yet they step aside as from a precipice. So the poor people here may or may not believe anything; they don't go into those trees at night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> {{if one of}} the world's largest banks became {{severely}} distressed and {{was forced}} to suspend trading, except to say that it would be far worse than long-term capital management: firstly, because they have ongoing trades with every significant market player, everywhere; secondly, because the sums of money are so much larger. A bulge-bracket bank will, on any given day, have over a ten trillion dollars of open trades on the foreign exchange markets and in derivatives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{seen him}} in here," [...] said the office-boy. The truth shone coldly on Sally. She blamed herself for ever having gone away, and told herself {{that she might have}} <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> Left to his own resources, the unhappy Ginger had once more made a hash of it. And this hash must have been a more notable and {{outstanding}} hash than any of his previous efforts, for, surely, Fillmore would not lightly have dismissed one who had come to him under her special protection.|$|R
50|$|Finding a bottled {{message has}} {{generally}} been viewed positively, the finder of a 98-year-old message referring to his find as winning the lottery. However, intense media attention over a personal relationship that resulted from one woman's find, {{is said to have}} caused her to remark that had she <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> she <b>would</b> have left the bottle on the beach. Another woman said she initially felt shocked and violated by publication of the personal suffering she had expressed in a bottled letter that she never expected would be found or read.|$|R
60|$|March and Fulkerson {{said the}} same to each other; and Fulkerson {{said that if the}} old man pulled out, he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> He had no capital to carry the thing on, and the very fact that the old man had pulled out would damage it so that {{it would be hard to}} get anybody else to put it. In the mean time Fulkerson was running Conrad's office-work, when he ought to be looking after the outside {{interests}} of the thing; and he could not see the day when he could get married.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning in}} the middle of the week after this {{incident}} the innocent author of it presented herself in Hilary's study, and, standing in her peculiar patient attitude, made her little statements. As usual, they were very little ones; as usual, she seemed helpless, and suggested a child with a sore finger. She had no other work; she owed the week's rent; she did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to her; Mrs. Dallison did not want her any more; she could not tell what she had done! The picture was finished, she knew, but Mrs. Dallison had said she was going to paint her again in another picture....|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks to you," [...] she murmured. [...] "However," [...] she added, with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "I don't want to frighten you away, and I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if I {{began to talk about}} our adventure. I am sorry, Captain Granet," [...] she went on, turning towards where he was standing, [...] "but I cannot {{possibly}} accept your aunt's invitation. It was very good of her to ask me and very kind of you to want me to go so much, but to-night I could not leave my mother. She has been having rather a fit of nerves about Ralph the last few days, and she hates being left alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now that}} the {{announcement}} of my engagement is out she's certain to get busy. Probably she {{has been waiting for}} something of the sort. Don't you see that all the cards are in her hands? We couldn't afford to let the thing come into court. That poetry would dish my marriage for a certainty. I'd have to emigrate or something! Goodness <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> at home! My old gov'nor would murder me! So you see what a frightful hole I'm in, don't you, Dickie, old man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and, Dick," [...] I went on, breathlessly, [...] "the Greaser {{followed}} me, and if I hadn't {{missed the}} trail, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened.</b> Anyway, he got here first." ...|$|R
50|$|The SPD and the CDU both {{wound up}} with 42 seats (of 110). Being that neither was able to form a majority, there was a several-month-long lull, during which no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> The center-right CDU could not form a {{government}} with its most natural ally the free-marketist FDP, nor could the center-left SPD with its most natural ally the Greens. And no one wanted a grand coalition of the two centrist parties (SPD and CDU). The far-left Linke party and its 6 seats was thus the kingmaker, exactly the result it had hoped for.|$|R
