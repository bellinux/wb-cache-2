25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into <b>fixed</b> <b>objects,</b> from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering wheel rim hyperextends the thumb.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of Proto-Cubism {{the idea of}} form inherent in art since the Renaissance had been questioned. The romanticist Eugène Delacroix, the realist Gustave Courbet, and practically all the Impressionists had abandoned {{a significant portion of}} Classicism in favor of immediate sensation. The dynamic expression favored by these artists presented a challenge in contrast to the static means of expression promoted by the Academia. The representation of <b>fixed</b> <b>objects</b> occupying a space, was replaced by dynamic colors and form in constant evolution. Yet other means would be necessary to jettison completely the long-standing foundation that surrounded them. While the freedom of Impressionism had certainly jeopardized its integrity, it would take another generation of artists, not just to bring the edifice down piece by piece, but to rebuild an entirely new configuration, cube by cube.|$|E

500|$|Scientific {{readers were}} already aware of {{arguments}} that species changed through processes that {{were subject to}} laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague [...] "law of development" [...] of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were <b>fixed</b> <b>objects</b> created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.|$|E

60|$|Torpenhow was {{sprawling}} {{in a long}} {{chair with}} a small fox-terrier asleep on his chest, while Dick was preparing a canvas. A dais, a background, and a lay- figure were the only <b>fixed</b> <b>objects</b> in the place. They rose from a wreck of oddments that began with felt-covered water-bottles, belts, and regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of second-hand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had just gone away. The watery autumn sunlight was falling, and shadows sat {{in the corners of}} the studio.|$|E
6000|$|This rural delirium, as he justly calls it, {{lasted for}} some days, {{at the end}} of which he began seriously to apply himself to work. But work was too soon broken off by a mood of vehement exaltation, {{produced}} by the stimulus given to all his senses by the new world of delight in which he found himself. This exaltation was in a different direction from that which had seized him half a dozen years before, when he had discarded the usage and costume of politer society, and had begun to conceive an angry contempt for the manners, prejudices, and maxims of his time. Restoration to a more purely sensuous atmosphere softened this austerity. No longer having the vices of a great city before his eyes, he no longer cherished the wrath which they had inspired in him. [...] "When I did not see men, I ceased to despise them; and when I had not the bad before my eyes, I ceased to hate them. My heart, little made as it is for hate, now did no more than deplore their wretchedness, and made no distinction between their wretchedness and their badness. This state, so much more mild, if much less sublime, soon dulled the glowing enthusiasm that had long transported me."[256] That is to say, his nature remained for a moment not exalted but fairly balanced. It was only for a moment. And in studying the movements of impulse and reflection in him at this critical time of his life, we are hurried rapidly from phase to phase. Once more we are watching a man who lived without either intellectual or spiritual direction, swayed by a reminiscence, a passing mood, a personality accidentally encountered, by anything except permanent aim and <b>fixed</b> <b>objects,</b> and who would at any time have surrendered the most deliberately pondered scheme of persistent effort to the fascination of a cottage slumbering in a bounteous landscape. Hence there could be no normally composed state for him; the first soothing effect of the rich life of forest and garden on a nature exasperated by the life of the town passed away, and became transformed into an exaltation that swept the stoic into space, leaving sensuousness to sovereign and uncontrolled triumph, until the delight turned to its inevitable ashes and bitterness.|$|E
60|$|Geographical Range; Habitats.--The Pedunculated Cirripedes extend {{over the}} whole world; {{and most of the}} {{individual}} species have large ranges, more especially, as might have been expected, those attached to floating objects; excepting these latter, the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate, and tropical seas. Of those attached to <b>fixed</b> <b>objects,</b> or to littoral animals, it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality. On the shores of Europe I know of only three, viz., a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Alepas. At Madeira (owing to the admirable researches of the Rev. R. T. Lowe), two Pæcilasmas, a Dichelaspis, and an Oxynaspis are known. In New Zealand, there are two Pollicipes and an Alepas, and, perhaps, a fourth form. From the Philippine Archipelago, in the great collection made by Mr. Cuming, there are a Pæcilasma, an Ibla, a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Lithotrya. Of all the Lepadidæ, nearly half are attached to floating objects, or to animals which are able to change their positions; the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies, and more frequently to the former than to the latter. Most of the species of Scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water; on the other hand, most of Pollicipes,[21] of Ibla, and Lithotrya are littoral forms. The species of Lithotrya have the power of excavating burrows in calcareous rocks, shells, and corals; and the singular manner in which this is effected, is described under that genus. Anelasma has its sub-globular peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of Northern Sharks; and I have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of Conchoderma aurita, being sunk into the skin of Cetacea; in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of Ibla, is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female. I believe in all these cases, the cementing substance affects and injures the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic, whilst the surrounding parts, being not injured, continue to grow upwards, thus causing the partial embedment of the Cirripede. In the case of Anelasma, we have growth {{at the end of the}} peduncle, and consequently downward pressure, and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on.|$|E

6000|$|To {{the region}} of the rain-cloud belong also all those {{phenomena}} of drifted smoke, heat-haze, local mists in the morning or evening; in valleys, or over water, mirage, white steaming vapor rising in evaporation from moist and open surfaces, and everything which visibly affects the condition of the atmosphere without actually assuming the form of cloud. These phenomena are as perpetual in all countries as they are beautiful, and afford by far the most effective and valuable means which the painter possesses, for modification of the forms of <b>fixed</b> <b>objects.</b> The upper clouds are distinct and comparatively opaque, they do not modify, but conceal; but through the rain-cloud, and its accessory phenomena, all that is beautiful may be made manifest, and all that is hurtful concealed; what is paltry may be made to look vast, and what is ponderous, aerial; mystery may be obtained without obscurity, and decoration without disguise. And, accordingly, nature herself uses it constantly, as one of her chief means of most perfect effect; not in one country, nor another, but everywhere--everywhere; at least, where there is anything worth calling landscape. I cannot answer for the desert of the Sahara, but I know {{that there can be no}} greater mistake, than supposing that delicate and variable effects of mist and rain-cloud are peculiar to northern climates. I have never seen in any place or country effects of mist more perfect than in the Campagna of Rome, and among the hills of Sorrento. It is therefore matter of no little marvel to me, and I conceive that it can scarcely be otherwise to any reflecting person, that throughout the whole range of ancient landscape art, there occurs no instance of the painting of a real rain-cloud, still less of any of the more delicate phenomena characteristic of the region. [...] "Storms" [...] indeed, as the innocent public persist in calling such abuses of nature and abortions of art as the two windy Gaspars in our National Gallery, are common enough; massive concretions of ink and indigo, wrung and twisted very hard, apparently in a vain effort to get some moisture out of them; bearing up courageously and successfully against a wind, whose effects on the trees in the foreground can be accounted for only on the supposition that they are all of the India-rubber species. Enough of this in all conscience, we have, and to spare; but for the legitimate rain-cloud, with its ragged and spray-like edge, its veilly transparency, and its columnar burden of blessing, neither it, nor anything like it, or approaching it, occurs in any painting of the old masters that I have ever seen; and I have seen enough to warrant my affirming that if it occur anywhere, it must be through accident rather than intention. Nor is there stronger evidence of any perception, on the part of these much respected artists, that there were such things in the world as mists or vapors. If a cloud under their direction ever touches a mountain, it does it effectually and as if it meant to do it. There is no mystifying the matter; here is a cloud, and there is a hill; if it is to come on at all, it comes on to some purpose, and there is no hope of its ever going off again. We have, therefore, little to say of the efforts of the old masters, in any scenes which might naturally have been connected with the clouds of the lowest region, except that the faults of form specified in considering the central clouds, are, by way of being energetic or sublime, more glaringly and audaciously committed in their [...] "storms;" [...] and that what is a wrong form among clouds possessing form, is there given with increased generosity of fiction to clouds which have no form at all.|$|E
