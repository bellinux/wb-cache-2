5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other <b>distiller</b> was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{alternative to}} domain-independent planning {{is to provide}} example plans to demonstrate how to solve problems in a particular domain and to use that information to learn domainspecific planners. Others have used example plans for case-based planning, but the retrieval and adaptation mechanisms for the inevitably large case libraries raise efficiency issues of concern. In this paper, we introduce dsPlanners, or automatically generated domain-specific planners. We present the <b>DISTILL</b> algorithm for learning dsPlanners automatically from example plans. <b>DISTILL</b> converts a plan into a dsPlanner and then merges it with previously learned dsPlanners. Our {{results show that the}} dsPlanners automatically learned by <b>DISTILL</b> compactly represent its domain-specific planning experience. Furthermore, the dsPlanners situationally generalize the given example plans, thus allowing them to efficiently solve problems that have not previously been encountered. Finally, we present the <b>DISTILL</b> procedure to automatically acquire one-step loops from example plans, which permits experience acquired from small problems to be applied to solving arbitrarily large ones. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{advantage}} of the flash <b>distiller</b> over the compound evaporator is its greater operating efficiency, in terms of heat supplied. This is due to working under vacuum, thus low temperature, and also the regenerative use of the condenser coils to pre-heat the seawater feed.|$|E
