5|$|A kitsune {{may take}} on human form, an ability learned {{when it reaches}} a certain age—usually 100 years, {{although}} some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a broad leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. Sometimes young adult males These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate {{the appearance of a}} specific person. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox. Kitsune-gao or fox-faced refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones.</b> Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones</b> and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
25|$|The bishōnen is {{typically}} slender, with clear skin, stylish hair, and distinctly feminine facial features (such as <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones),</b> but simultaneously retains a male body. This androgynous appearance {{is akin to}} the depiction of angels in Western renaissance art, with similar social roots for this aesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{was almost}} painfully thin {{in his early}} days, with <b>high,</b> {{prominent}} <b>cheekbones,</b> and his looks gave no real promise of the handsome, world-class screen star he matured into overseas", wrote Hall in his memoirs. [...] "But from the beginning he was a really first-class actor." [...] Indeed, Hall later cast Finch in {{a larger role in}} Mr. Chedworth Steps Out (1939).|$|R
60|$|The moon-cat, who had now {{reached his}} shoulder, brushed {{the tip of}} her tail across his loose right eyebrow, while Blink's jealous tongue avidly licked his <b>high</b> left <b>cheekbone.</b> With one hand Mr. Lavender was cuddling the cat's head, with the other {{twiddling}} Blink's forelock, and the watchers could see his eyes shining, and his white hair standing up all ruffled.|$|R
60|$|This was {{spoken with}} so sweet and {{polished}} a modulation, {{and yet so}} sadly and severely withal, that Tom looked at the speaker with interest. He was a very tall and powerful man, {{and would have been}} a very handsome man, both in face and figure, but for the <b>high</b> <b>cheekbone,</b> long neck, and narrow shoulders, so often seen north of Tweed. His brow was very high and full; his eyes--grave, but very gentle, with large drooping eyelids --were buried under shaggy grey eyebrows. His mouth was gentle as his eyes; but compressed, perhaps by the habit of command, perhaps by secret sorrow; for of that, too, as well as of intellect and magnanimity, Thurnall thought he could discern the traces. His face was bronzed by long exposure to the sun; his close-cut curls, which had once been auburn, were fast turning white, though his features looked those of a man under five-and-forty; his cheeks were as smooth shaven as his chin. A right, self-possessed, valiant soldier he looked; one who could be very loving to little innocents, and very terrible to full-grown knaves.|$|R
25|$|Poulidor's riding {{style was}} {{aggressive}} and attacking, whereas Anquetil preferred {{to control the}} race {{in the mountains and}} win time in the time-trials. Poulidor became the darling of the French public, to the ire of Anquetil. Poulidor's mid-France upbringing and his slow Limousin speech also contrasted with Anquetil's northern background and sharper accent. Poulidor's face was deeply tanned and furrowed; Anquetil had <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> a smoother face and brushed-up blond hair.|$|E
25|$|During Cäcilie's childhood, the 1848-49 {{revolution}} {{forced the}} Grand Ducal family to flee from Karlsruhe to Koblenz. Cäcilie was 12 {{years old at}} the death of her father in 1852. Princess Cäcilie received a Spartan upbringing. Her relationship with her parents was formal rather than affectionate. She would later apply these same principles raising her own children. She grew into a sharp-tongued girl, witty and well-educated. With <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones</b> and oblique eyes, she had striking Eurasian looks.|$|E
25|$|They have {{distinctive}} styles {{which do}} not compare with the Gupta period sculptures of North India. In these caves, the carvings of {{the faces of the}} human figures are oval shaped with <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones.</b> The body looks slim with tapering limbs. They have several striking mythological scenes carved in relief. Vishnu rescuing the earth, Vishnu taking three strides, and Gaja Laksmi and Durga are all in the Adi-Varaha Cave. Mahishasura Mardhini is in Durga Cave. Krishna lifting mountain is seen in the Pancha-Panadava cave. The relief carving in the Pallava caves is generally shallower than the Deccan caves. The main figures are slender, delicate and elegant. Their hair dresses and crowns are simple and they show no jewellery. Another particular feature noted in the caves is that the lingas are individual carvings and in prismatic shape. However, the drainage as normally provided in the form of pranala or water chute with the linga to drain the abhisheka (Hindu ritual) offering water is not provided in the caves.|$|E
25|$|In the 1800s, the carver, Yomeisay, {{created a}} netsuke (miniature) of Pinto. He is {{accompanied}} by a mythological beast that can only be tamed by magic. Fernão Mendes is shown with unusual fluffy whiskers and beard like the wings spread on his chest. European facial features include a long nose, round eyes, textured <b>cheekbones,</b> <b>high</b> forehead and pear-shaped skull. He is depicted as tall, round-shouldered and thin in a naturalistic way. His long frock shows European buttons.|$|R
5000|$|A.O. Scott of The New York Times {{felt that}} Anthony as Lavoe was hidden behind [...] "his <b>high,</b> {{delicate}} <b>cheekbones</b> and tinted glasses" [...] but [...] "Whenever Héctor takes the stage, however, Mr. Anthony unleashes his charisma, and shows that, whatever his limitations as an actor, he {{is a brilliant}} performer". Scott praised Lopez's performance, noting that it had [...] "a lot of fight" [...] with [...] "a hard, skeptical edge" [...] that made Puchi [...] "a more interesting and plausible character than her husband". Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film and Anthony's performance a positive review, but was critical of Lopez, calling her performance [...] "predictably self-conscious" [...] but said her sequences [...] "complements Puchi's own". Renee Schonfield of Common Sense Media gave El cantante a negative review, [...] "brings the magic of salsa music to the screen; unfortunately, it also brings the audience another bleak story of a flameout singer bent on self-destruction".|$|R
50|$|I ate it all; plastic, {{diamonds}} and sugar-coated arsenic as we danced in honey and sea-salt sprinkled laxative. Coral blossomed portraits in Rembrandt light; <b>cheekbones</b> <b>high</b> and fashionable. Snap! goes the moment; a photograph is time travel, like {{the light of}} dead stars painting us with their warm, titanic blood. Parasitic kaleidoscopes and psychotropic glow worms stop me dead in my tracks. Aphids sucking the red off a rose, but for beauty I will gladly feed my life into the mouths of rainbows; their technicolor teeth cutting prisms and smiling benevolently on the pallid hue {{of the working class}} hero.|$|R
500|$|The bust of Nefertiti {{has become}} [...] "one {{of the most}} admired, and most copied, images from ancient Egypt", and the star exhibit used to market Berlin's museums. It {{is seen as an}} [...] "icon of {{international}} beauty". [...] "Showing a woman with a long neck, elegantly arched brows, <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> a slender nose and an enigmatic smile played about red lips, the bust has established Nefertiti {{as one of the most}} beautiful faces of antiquity." [...] It is described as the most famous bust of ancient art, comparable only to the mask of Tutankhamun.|$|E
500|$|Captain Davy Jones had {{originally}} been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; {{the skin of the}} character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his [...] "beard" [...] as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones.</b> Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: [...] "Kit Carson {{was five}} feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, {{squarely}} built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, {{his head and}} face made up for all the imperfections {{of the rest of}} his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946 Miller was loaned out to Monogram Pictures. She {{played a}} model in the 1946 film noir, Suspense, where she appears as a party guest. Production ran mid-October–early December 1945. Around this time, Miller moved in the old Wallace Reid mansion in Coldwater Canyon, now {{converted}} into a boarding house for aspiring actresses known as [...] "The House of the Seven Garbos." [...] Among the boarders were Ruth Roman, Suzan Ball and Linda Christian. According to Doris Lilly, a former boarder and later society columnist, [...] "The dignity {{of the house in}} general was presided over and encouraged by Kristine Miller, who was blonde haired, <b>high</b> of <b>cheekbone,</b> grey eyed. Kristine had balance, she would check some of our madder impulses, kept us calm when that was necessary. Her manner was quiet and refined, and she had a way of touching a grubby coffeepot {{as if it were the}} tiara of the Empress Josephine. In spite of her reserve, we all knew that Kristine had a fine future for her somewhere, and we felt that she was an excellent actress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rozsi!" [...] {{said the}} Hungarian. A young girl came in. She was rather short, with a deliciously round figure {{and a thick}} plait of hair. She smiled, and showed her even teeth; her little, bright, wide-set grey eyes glanced from one man to the other. Her face was round, too, <b>high</b> in the <b>cheekbones,</b> the colour of wild roses, with brows that had a twist-up at the corners. With a gesture of alarm, {{she put her hand}} to her cheek, and called, [...] "Margit!" [...] An older girl appeared, taller, with fine shoulders, large eyes, a pretty mouth, and what Swithin {{described}} to himself afterwards as a [...] "pudding" [...] nose. Both girls, with little cooing sounds, began attending to their father's face.|$|R

2500|$|A {{trend of}} bodysuits was {{observed}} by film reviewer Alan Farrell {{in his book}} <b>High</b> <b>Cheekbones,</b> Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans, and a number or occurrences of the garb in films were mentioned - Charlize Theron in Aeon Flux, Milla Jovovich in the [...] and [...] film of the Resident Evil franchise, Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix, Angelina Jolie in , Kate Beckinsale in Underworld, and Raquel Welch in Fantastic Voyage. The trend of leather and vinyl catsuits were identified {{as an attempt to}} redefine the gender role of women through films. Theresa L. Geller described the catsuit {{as a part of the}} Hollywood tough chic paradigm in an article published in the journal [...] That view was shared by Sherrie A. Inness in her book Action Chicks, which also included computer games and professional wrestling in that paradigm. The Action Heroine's Handbook describes the catsuit as one of the three options of the first rule of thumb described in the book: [...] "Dress to accentuate your best physical assets". Action Chicks: New Images of Tough Women in Popular Culture by Sherrie A. Inness describes catsuits as an iconic garb of female TV and film characters.|$|E
2500|$|Bogart met Lauren Bacall while filming To Have and Have Not (1944), a loose {{adaptation}} of the Ernest Hemingway novel. The movie has many similarities with Casablanca—the same enemies, {{the same kind of}} hero, even a piano player sidekick (played by Hoagy Carmichael). When they met, Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44. He nicknamed her [...] "Baby." [...] She had been a model since 16 and had acted in two failed plays. Bogart was drawn to Bacall's <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> green eyes, tawny blond hair, and lean body, as well as her maturity, poise and earthy, outspoken honesty. [...] Reportedly he said, [...] "I just saw your test. We'll {{have a lot of fun}} together". Their physical and emotional rapport was very strong from the start, their age difference and disparity in acting experience allowing the dynamic of a mentor-student relationship to emerge. Quite contrary to Hollywood norm, their affair was Bogart's first with a leading lady. He was still married and his early meetings with Bacall were discreet and brief, their separations bridged by ardent love letters. [...] The relationship made it much easier for the newcomer to make her first film, and Bogart did his best to put her at ease with jokes and quiet coaching. He let her steal scenes and even encouraged it. Howard Hawks, for his part, also did his best to boost her performance and highlight her role, and found Bogart easy to direct.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Clirehugh came in; {{she was in}} black, her cheekbones higher, {{her hair}} looser, her eyes bigger. Mrs. Gerhardt saw tears {{starting}} from those eyes, wetting those <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> and cried out: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "His {{face was}} a very fine one, {{although}} sickness and pain had worn it away terribly. His eyes were black, piercing and restless; his <b>cheekbones</b> <b>high,</b> and the lips, naturally thin and close, had that white, compressed look which tells so surely of constant suffering."When Mayne remarked that Lolo, in his decayed health, must {{find it hard to}} rule over his people,"...he heard me with a grim smile, and for answer turned back his pillow, where a loaded gun and a naked sword lay ready to his hand."The invalid Lolo showed, in fact, unexpected reserves of strength. Rising from his bed, he mounted his horse, and accompanied Mayne on a ride to see the view from the top of a neighbouring mountain, which was forthwith named Mt. St. Paul in honour of the old chief. Moreover, Lolo insisted on accompanying Mayne on the next lap of his journey, that from Kamloops to Pavilion." ...|$|R
5000|$|The John VII decorations feature Hellenistic styles fused {{with earlier}} Roman linear styles. [...] Although John VII's frescoes are adorned with breezy tunics, toned {{contours}} {{of flesh and}} animated expressions that individualized the saints, they are considered by archaeologists and historians to be strained in their movement. [...] The artists posed them in conversation with quick hands and turned heads but their backs are [...] "flat" [...] against the background instead of turning inwards toward the conversation. [...] An example of this detail {{comes in the form}} of Saint Hermolaus of Macedon in the Chapel of Physicians who is pictured with <b>high,</b> strongly contoured <b>cheekbones,</b> asymmetrical eyes, arching eyebrows with highlighted long, dark hair and a flowing beard. There are no known contemporary parallels to Santa Maria Antiqua's use of white highlighting that is common here.

60|$|At {{the door}} of the shack the gambler hesitated for an instant, marvelling at the strangeness of this man who had befriended him, and doubting. But by the candlelight he found the cabin {{comfortable}} and without occupants, and he was quickly rolling a cigarette while the other man made coffee. His muscles relaxed in the warmth and he lay back with half-assumed indolence, intently studying Uri's face through the curling wisps of smoke. It was a powerful face, but its strength was of that peculiar sort which stands girt in and unrelated. The seams were deep-graven, more like scars, while the stern features were in no way softened by hints of sympathy or humor. Under prominent bushy brows the eyes shone cold and gray. The <b>cheekbones,</b> <b>high</b> and forbidding, were undermined by deep hollows. The chin and jaw displayed a steadiness of purpose which the narrow forehead advertised as single, and, if needs be, pitiless. Everything was harsh, the nose, the lips, the voice, the lines about the mouth. It was the face of one who communed much with himself, unused to seeking counsel from the world; the face of one who wrestled oft of nights with angels, and rose to face the day with shut lips that no man might know. He was narrow but deep; and Fortune, his own humanity broad and shallow, could make nothing of him. Did Uri sing when merry and sigh when sad, he could have understood; but as it was, the cryptic features were undecipherable; he could not measure the soul they concealed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought you'd gone," [...] {{she said}} gravely, pushing hack her bonnet trn {{he could see}} her face dewed with sweat and pink as a rose. She had the <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones</b> of her race, but she had also their {{exquisite}} fairess of color.|$|E

60|$|And {{the face}} of Jaspar Bellew asleep was {{the face of}} a man who has ridden far, to get away from himself, and to-morrow will have to ride far again. His sandy eyebrows twitched with his dreams against the dead-white, {{freckled}} skin above <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> and two hard ridges were fixed between his brows; now and then over the sleeping face came the look of one riding at a gate.|$|E
60|$|Was this a man, {{or was it}} {{a spirit}} escaped from doom? Blessed Mother of Christ! what a countenance! The eyeballs {{starting}} and upturned, nothing but the white of them to be seen; the lips curled, and, between, two lines of shining fangs; the lifted points of the mustachios touching the <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones.</b> No--no, it was neither a spirit nor a man, she knew now what it was; it was the very type and incarnation of the Spanish Wolf.|$|E
60|$|A man {{was shown}} {{into the room}} a moment later. I leaned forward in my chair so as to see more {{distinctly}} the hero {{of one of the}} most famous cases that had ever been tried in a criminal court. Of his renowned good looks there was little left. He stood there, still tall, with <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> furtive eyes and long mouth. He wore good clothes, his linen was irreproachable, and he kept his gloves on. Nevertheless the stamp of the prison was upon him.|$|E
60|$|Following the sound, he led {{his master}} down two long {{corridors}} {{that ended in}} a chapel. There, lying before the altar, they found a man clad in a filthy priest's robe, a dying man who still {{had the strength to}} cry for help or mercy, although in truth he was wasted to a skeleton, since the plague which had taken him was of the most lingering sort. Indeed, little seemed to be left of him save his rolling eyes, prominent nose and <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones</b> covered with yellow parchment that had been skin, and a stubbly growth of unshaven hair.|$|E
60|$|There {{never was}} an uglier man than Carrier, with that long hatchet-face of his, those {{abnormally}} <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> that stiff, lanky hair, that drooping, flaccid mouth and protruding underlip. Nature {{seemed to have}} set herself the task of making the face a true mirror of the soul--the dark and hideous soul on which of a surety Satan had already set his stamp. But he is dressed with scrupulous care--not to say elegance--and with a display of jewelry the provenance of which is as unjustifiable {{as that of the}} works of art which fill his private sanctum in every nook and cranny.|$|E
60|$|The {{inner door}} burst {{open and a}} big figure appeared, who {{was more of a}} {{contrast}} to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler. Nearly six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles, Isidore Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments of Oberon, looked like a barbaric god. He leaned on a sort of hunting-spear, which across a theatre looked a slight, silvery wand, but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as a pike-staff--and as menacing. His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically, his bronzed face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment a combination of <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones</b> with set white teeth, which recalled certain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations.|$|E
60|$|As the {{newcomer}} approached, Saxon glimpsed sufficient {{of his face}} {{to be reminded of}} the old pioneers and of a certain type of face seen frequently among the old soldiers: Young though he was--not more than thirty, she decided--this man had the same long and narrow face, with the <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> high and slender forehead, and nose high, lean, and almost beaked. The lips were thin and sensitive; but the eyes were different from any she had ever seen in pioneer or veteran or any man. They were so dark a gray that they seemed brown, and there were a farness and alertness of vision in them as of bright questing through profounds of space. In a misty way Saxon felt that she had seen him before.|$|E
60|$|Young Jolyon {{sat down}} not far off, and began nervously to reconsider his position. He looked covertly at Bosinney sitting there unconscious. He {{did not know}} him very well, and studied him attentively for perhaps the first time; an unusual looking man, unlike in dress, face, and manner {{to most of the}} other members of the Club--young Jolyon himself, however {{different}} he had become in mood and temper, had always retained the neat reticence of Forsyte appearance. He alone among Forsytes was ignorant of Bosinney's nickname. The man was unusual, not eccentric, but unusual; he looked worn, too, haggard, hollow in the cheeks beneath those broad, <b>high</b> <b>cheekbones,</b> though without any appearance of ill-health, for he was strongly built, with curly hair that seemed to show all the vitality of a fine constitution.|$|E
6000|$|There was a shout as {{the fallen}} horse {{was on his}} legs again, much cut, and the {{carriage}} shattered and useless. A gentleman came from the crowd and approached the lady.

His dress, though not vulgar, was richer and more showy than is usual in this country, and altogether {{there was something in}} his manner which, though calm and full of self-respect, was different from the conventional refinement of England. Yet he was apparently an Englishman, as he said to the lady, [...] "It is a bad business, but we must be thankful it is no worse. What troubles me is how you are to get back.
