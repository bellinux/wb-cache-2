40|$|<b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) are long-distance migrants, while Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) exhibit more {{variable}} migration tendencies. I {{investigated the}} migratory behavior {{of these species}} using orientation cages and tested hypotheses concerning (1) the presence of migratory restlessness and orientation, (2) inter-specific differences in migratory restlessness and orientation, and (3) correlates of migratory restlessness and orientation. Only four of 16 <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> displayed activity consistent with migratory restlessness although all four owls exhibited significant directionality in their movements. Alternatively, 59 of 97 Northern Saw-whet Owls exhibited activity consistent with migratory restlessness with most of these 59 owls showing preferred directions of orientation. Neither species oriented consistently as a group and, contrary to expectation, Northern Saw-whet Owls exhibited more restlessness in orientation cages. The relative lack of migratory restlessness in <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> might {{be a function of}} small sample sizes or simply this particular species’ reaction to an unfamiliar situation. In <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls,</b> migratory restlessness increased with decreasing natural cloud cover, and was more pronounced in birds with larger flight muscles. Contrary to predictions, <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> also showed a marginal increase in restlessness in response to decreasing furcular fat stores which could be a function of small samples sizes.

40|$|Except for a {{few studies}} in the eastern United States, little has been {{published}} on hemoparasites in owls. We surveyed the blood parasites of 108 Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) and 24 <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) in Idaho during autumn migration in 1999 and 2000. We also surveyed 15 <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (FLOW) during breeding season in Utah from 2000. Leucocytozoon ziemanni, Haemoproteus syrnii, Haemoproteus noctuae,and Trypanosoma avium were identified. The overall prevalence of infection was 53 % (78 / 147) and for the combined species, prevalences ofHaemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Trypanosoma species were 20 %, 39 %, and 4 %, respectively. Northern Saw-whet Owls (NSWO) had an overall prevalence of 51 % (55 / 108), with prevalences of 6 %, 47 %, and 4 % by hemoparasite genus, respectively. <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> had an overall prevalence of 59 % (23 / 39), with prevalences of 56 %, 18 %, and 5 % by genus, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{reproductive}} ecology, {{diet and}} habitat used by <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) during the breeding seasons of 1983 and 1984 were studied in northeastern Oregon. Remote photography was used at 5 nest cavities to record diet; radiotelemetry {{was used to}} determine habitat used for home ranges, nesting, roosting and foraging by 5 male owls; arthropod window traps were used to sample relative abundances of prey between 3 habitats. Density of breeding pairs was estimated at 0. 47 / 40 ha. Home range areas averaged 10. 3 ha. The diet (N= 352), monitored after hatching, spanned 8 orders of arthropods but 62 % of the prey items and 85 % of the biomass were order Orthoptera. Relative proportions of arthropods trapped were greatest in grassland habitat (70 % of total) and least in mixed conifer habitat (8 % of total). Of 5 owls monitored while foraging (N= 352 locations), 4 used ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) /Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest type and 5 used the edge between forests and grasslands significantly more than these types occurred within their home ranges. Owls used roost stands (N= 37) of mixed conifer forest type significantly more than it occurred on the combined home ranges, however, within roost stands, <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> selected ponderosa pine trees for roosts over grand fir (Abies grandis), western larch (Larix occidentalis) or Douglas-fir. This may be related to predator avoidance since <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> are better camouflaged in ponderosa pine than in the other tree species. Nest sites were selected apparently for the surrounding forest stand and ground cover rather than for any variable measured at nest cavities or trees. Owls used forest stands characterized by ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir species composition, trees 30 - 50 cm dbh, canopies with less than 50 % closure and slopes of 16 to 25 percent significantly more than these occurred on the study area. Characteristics of ground cover at nest sites included dominance by several species rather than by a single species, combination of types (grass, forb, shrub) and greater than 33 % ground coverage. These forest stand and ground cover characteristics are interrelated and likely influence prey populations. Timber production may affect habitat used by <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> for breeding. With suitable management, however, timber production and viable populations of <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> may be compatible...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters presenting results of my research on the ecology, habitat selection, and probability of detection of <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) in Idaho. My objectives were to 1) document details of breeding season chronology, mortality, interspecific interactions, and movement patterns, 2) investigate patterns of habitat selection at multiple spatial scales, and 3) describe changes in detectability of owls by broadcast surveys {{over the course of}} the breeding season. I conducted fieldwork from May through August of 2005 and 2006 in the Lowman Ranger District of the Boise National Forest. In particular, I focused my studies in the Rock Creek, Miller Creek, and Lick Creek watersheds immediately surrounding the town of Lowman, in Boise County. As my research came to a close, the Rock Creek watershed began undergoing timber harvest, controlled burns, and other manipulations designed to thin the forest and help restore pre-settlement forest conditions. The behavioral and habitat use data I collected will serve as a reference in future studies to help understand the response of <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> to such habitat manipulations. Numerous management agencies consider <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> a sensitive species in part because of the lack of information on response to habitat alteration. Therefore information contained in this thesis should be useful to those interested in the biology and conservation of this little-known forest owl as well as to forest managers charged with guiding restoration efforts and management activities...|$|R
40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} models depicting species occupancy offer {{a useful}} conservation tool for land managers. Using occurrence data collected in 2009 and 2010 from the Boise National Forest, Idaho, we developed distribution models for <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) to explore associations between habitat factors and owl occupancy. We then spatially applied these models in a Geographic Information System. We considered land cover and topographic variables at three spatial scales: 0. 4 -km, 1 -km, or 3 -km-radius plots centered on point-count locations (n  =  150) with resolution of land covers at 30 m. <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> occupied 27 (18 %) point-count locations and occurred {{in areas with}} {{a higher proportion of}} Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at the 0. 4 -km scale, less diverse land cover composition at the 1 -km scale, and in south-facing aspects at the 3 -km scale. Northern Saw-whet Owls occupied 45 (30 %) point-count locations and were associated with relatively flat terrain at the 0. 4 -km scale that had larger proportions of non-forest land cover. At the 1 -km and 3 -km scales, Northern Saw-whet Owls occurred in areas with south-facing aspects having a higher proportion of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), respectively.

40|$|Broadcasts of conspecific vocalizations {{are used}} to {{increase}} detection rates on surveys of secretive bird species, yet the assessment of detectability necessary to fully interpret such survey data is frequently lacking. We used radiotelemetry to evaluate the probability of detection of 17 radio-tagged male <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Otus flammeolus) using conspecific broadcast surveys in Idaho during 2005 and 2006. Probability of detection among the 11 paired, five unpaired, and one unknown pairing status owls was 100 % during the pair-bonding and incubation periods of the breeding season, after which it declined to less than 15 % during the postfledging period. Paired males showed a different pattern than unpaired males. Following hatching of eggs, detectability of paired males declined gradually over a 6 -week period, whereas detectability of unpaired males dropped sharply for a 4 -week period before increasing during the postfledging period. We suggest that surveys for <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> be conducted during the pair-bonding and incubation periods when high detectability permits stronger inference concerning {{the presence or absence}} of owls based on broadcast survey detections...|$|R
40|$|Birds undergo many {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes {{in preparation for}} migration, such as zugunruhe, hyperphagia leading to pre-migratory fattening, and heightened immune system function. Birds in poor condition, without insufficient reserves, may not complete or even begin migration. Many aspects of the physiological changes occurring during migration are poorly understood, especially in raptors. I investigated the relationship between body condition and heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratios in fall migrating northern saw-whet (Aegolius acadicus) and <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> (Otusflammeolus). Blood smears were made and 200 white blood cells counted on each smear. There was a significant negative relationship between H:L ratios and body condition index in northern saw-whet owls: as body condition decreased, H:L ratios increased. An increased H:L ratio is indicative of increased stress on the immune system. There was no detectable relationship between H:L ratio and body condition index in f 1 ammulated owls; however, the sample size was low. While the H:L ratio {{may be a good}} index for chronic stress, this ratio may not be as useful during migration when most migrating birds are in good condition. A relationship has been shown between hemoparasites and body condition during the breeding season. I investigated this relationship during the migration season in the same owl species as above. Blood smears were made and hemoparasites counted per 200 white blood cells. For northern saw-whet owls in 1999, prevalence was 53 % (n = 30). In year 2000, northern saw-whet owls, prevalence was 47 (n = 70). In year 1999, f 1 ammulated owls had a prevalence of 44 % (n = 16). In 2000 prevalence was 33 % (n = 6). Three genera of hemoparasites were found in both owl species: Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp., and Trypanosoma spp. Northern saw-whet owls were primarily infected with L. ziemanni, while <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> were primarily infected with H. noctuae and H. syrnii. There was no detectable correlation between presence/absence of parasites and body condition index in <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls.</b> Traditionally, northern saw-whet owls are sexed in the field using a morphometric chart that was created from a discriminate function of mass and wing. However, this chart has an area of overlap between small females and large males requiring those birds to be classified in the field as unknown sex. Moreover, in <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls,</b> there is not enough dimorphism to allow them to be sexed by external measurements. I compared three methods of DNA sexing using two sets of primers: P 2 and P 8, and P 2550 and P 2718. All methods gave consistent and comparable results, and were used to successfully sex 44 <b>flammulated</b> <b>owls</b> and 210 northern saw-whet owls. DNA sexing allowed me to assign sex to 112 of 141 owls that would have been classified as unknown by the chart. When compared to DNA sexing results, morphometric methods had an accuracy rate of 97 % on owls definitively sexed by the morphometric chart. DNA sexing is recommended for monomorphic species and any birds that cannot be sexed by morphometric means...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{patterns}} in annual movements of animals {{is an important}} component of population ecology, particularly for migratory birds where migration timing and routes, and wintering habitats have key bearing on population dynamics. From 2009 to 2011, we used light-level geolocators to document the migratory movements of <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> (Psiloscops flammeolus). Four males departed from breeding areas in Colorado for fall migration between ≤ 5 and 21 October, arrived in wintering areas in Mexico between 11 October and 3 November, departed from wintering areas from ≤ 6 to 21 April, and returned to Colorado between 15 and 21 May. Core wintering areas for three males were located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt Mountains in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, and Puebla in central and east-central Mexico, and the core area for the other male was in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains in Tamaulipas. The mean distance from breeding to wintering centroids was 2057 ± 128 km (SE). During fall migration, two males took a southeastern path to eastern Mexico, and two males took a path due south to central Mexico. In contrast, during spring migration, all four males traveled north from Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains to the Rio Grande Valley and north through New Mexico. The first stopovers in fall and last stopovers in spring were the longest in duration for all males and located 300 – 400 km from breeding areas. Final spring stopovers may have allowed male <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> to fine tune the timing of their return to high-elevation breeding areas where late snows are not uncommon. One male tracked in both years had similar migration routes, timing, and wintering areas each year. Core wintering and final stopover areas were located primarily in coniferous forests and woodlands, particularly pine-oak forests, suggesting that these are important habitats for <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owls</b> throughout their annual cycle...|$|R

50|$|The <b>flammulated</b> <b>owl</b> (Psiloscops flammeolus) is a small, nocturnal owl {{approximately}} 15 cm {{long with}} a 36 cm wingspan. Males and females {{can be distinguished}} by their weight. Females are larger, ranging from 62 - 65 g and males are smaller ranging from 50 - 52 g. The owl gets the name flammulated from the flame like markings on its face (Bremiller, 2003). It breeds from southern British Columbia and the western United States to central Mexico. It is a neotropical migrant and winters south of the United States but also in Southern Texas, Arizona, and California (Verna,). Unlike many owls, they are migratory, leaving Canada and the United States in the fall. In the winter, they are found in northern Central America, from southern Mexico to Guatemala and El Salvador. Flammulated owls leave their breeding grounds in August to head to their wintering areas {{and then return to}} their breeding grounds in late April and early May (Samson, 2005). The <b>flammulated</b> <b>owl</b> is similar in appearance to the western screech owl but is only about one-quarter the mass, lacks large ear tufts (but has small ear tufts that are barely visible), has dark eyes and a different voice.

50|$|The <b>flammulated</b> <b>owl</b> nests in tree {{cavities}} and has 2 - 4 {{young at}} a time after a 26-day incubation period. The young are able to forage for their own prey after about 25-32 days (Samson, 2005). These owls are obligate cavity nesters meaning they will only create nests in tree cavities and no where else, (Linkhart & Renyolds, 2007). Females usually select cavities {{that used to be}} woodpecker or northern flicker nests(Samson, 2005). Their nests are bare and have no nesting material. Flammulated owls tend to form breeding pairs with unoccupied habitat between breeding clusters (Marti). They tend to have one clutch of eggs annually. Like other raptors they can live long and have high nesting success, (Linkhart & Renyolds, 2007). During the nesting period the female owls rely on the males to forage for them, (Linkhart & Renyolds, 2007).Nesting habitat in the western U.S. and Canada is usually mature, open ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests. Flammulated owls can also be found breeding in deciduous forests with some conifers present (Marti). In deciduous type habitat flammulated owls can still be productive in terms of breeding.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{closely related}} western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii), {{there are not}} [...] "morphs", as all owls of the western species are gray. Besides coloration, the western screech owl is of {{almost exactly the same}} general {{appearance}} and size as the eastern. The only reliable distinguishing features are the bill color, which is considerably darker (often a black-gray) in the western and olive-yellow in the eastern, and their different voices. The eastern and western screech owls overlap in the range in the Rio Grande valley at the Texas-Mexico border and the riparian woods of the Cimarron tributary of the Arkansas River on the edge of southern Great Plains. Other somewhat similar species that may abut the eastern screech owl's range in its western and southernmost distribution, like the Middle American screech owl (Megascops guatemalae; formerly called [...] "vermiculated screech owl"), whiskered screech owl (Megascops trichopsis) and the <b>flammulated</b> <b>owl</b> (Psiloscops flammeolus), are distinguished by their increasingly smaller body and foot size, different streaking pattern on breast (bolder on the whiskered, weaker on the others), different bare part coloration, and distinctive voices. Through much of the eastern United States, eastern screech owls are essentially physically unmistakable, because other owls with ear tufts are much larger and different colored and the only other small owl, the northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadius) is even smaller, with no ear tufts, a more defined facial disc, and browner overall color.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} aspects of <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus flammeolus) {{breeding}} ecology were {{studied in the}} aspen forests of northern Utah. The primary study site, Snow Basin, is undergoing heavy development {{in preparation for the}} 2002 Winter Olympic Games. First, <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> reproduction was measured to investigate possible impacts of Olympic ski area development. Flammulated Owls nesting near the development site fledged significantly fewer young than owls at the control site, and also differed compared to data from other <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> studies. Reduced productivity was attributable to significantly lower hatching rates at Snow Basin. Ski area development as well as high levels of recreational use were the most likely causes of this reduced productivity, possibly causing incubating females to flush, resulting in egg mortality. Second, an experiment was conducted to investigate possible impacts of artificial lighting on breeding Flammulated Owls. Flammulated Owls were observed foraging in and around lights, suggesting that lights did not have a negative impact. Feeding rates, development of young, and productivity were compared between lighted and unlighted nests and did not differ statistically. Finally, because the habitat at Snow Basin is unique for Flammulated Owls, and because the population nests primarily in nest boxes, habitat characteristics were described and nest site preferences examined. Results suggested Flammulated Owls were not as limited by habitat type as previously thought...|$|E

These owl species exhibited contrasting seasonal timing and body condition. <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> captures peaked in mid-September and Northern Saw-whet Owl captures peaked in early to mid-October. Flammulated Owls displayed greater body condition than Northern Saw-whet Owls and increasing condition scores during the season, whereas Northern Saw-whet Owls had no apparent seasonal condition patterns. Based on seasonal timing of captures, both species showed unimodal movement patterns characteristic of fall migrants. However, in 1999 both species’ capture rates were at least double those in other years of this study. Flammulated Owls’ earlier arrival and departure, coupled with superior body condition, were consistent among years and typical of a longdistance migration strategy. In contrast, the Northern Saw-whet Owls’ later arrival, more lengthy passage, and variable body condition were more characteristic of a short-distance migrant strategy.

Extrarange movements occurred throughout nesting with both sexes participating: males anytime during nesting and females only after their young fledged. Males appear to make ERMs to gain EPCs and later to evaluate resources {{and the status of}} males in other areas, whereas females may be assessing the success of nests in adjacent ranges to judge the quality of potential future mates. Recent studies have shown that extra-pair copulations (EPCs) in many birds are frequent in spite of a variety of mate-guarding strategies. McKinney et al. (1984) and Ford (1983) together list 115 birds in 30 families in which EPCs have been reported. No stri&orms appear on these lists. Ford (1983) discussed the adaptive significance of EPCs and associated extra-range movements (ERMs) of males holding "Type A " territories. M 6 ller (1987) reviewed three main hypotheses regarding intrusions by individuals into the territories of others (the territorial establishment hypothesis (Howard 1920, Morse 1976), the non-territorial holder hypothesis (Kacelnik and Krebs 1983), and the sperm competition hypothesis (Hinde 1956, Ford 1983)) and discussed the predictions of each according to, among others, the timing of intrusions (daily, seasonal) and the intruder's sex. We report an EPC in the <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> Otus flammeolus and document 21 cases of ERMs in this species, some of which were intrusions that are not directly predicted by either of the hypotheses. The breeding biology of Flammulated Owls was studie...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{migration}} geography of Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) is limited. We combined data from multiple {{studies in the}} western United States to evaluate patterns of variation in <b>Flammulated</b> <b>Owl</b> morphometrics. Measurements from autumn migration study sites in New Mexico, Nevada, and Idaho followed a geographic cline from southeast to northwest across the species 2 ̆ 7 range. Our objectives were to: (1) describe age- and sex-specific variation in the morphometrics of Flammulated Owls captured at the three sites, and (2) discuss {{the implications of this}} variation for understanding the species 2 ̆ 7 migration geography. Based on a hierarchical series of factorial two-way ANOVAs, we discovered significant overall sex-specific differences in wing chord, exposed culmen length, and hallux length, and a consistent pattern of site-specific differences for most measurements. Most measurements increased from southeast to northwest, consistent with previous data on clinal variation in the species. Evidence of significant variation in the morphometrics of owls captured at the three migration sites suggests little longitudinal mixing of migrants in the region...|$|E
