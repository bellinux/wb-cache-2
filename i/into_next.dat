The newer {{version of}} the album, {{entitled}} , was released on August 5, 2009, containing new remixes and a new song titled [...] "Wish You Were Here" [...] featuring Malaysian artist Che'Nelle. During her downtime Mýa started her own independent label, entitled Planet 9 and inked a deal with J. Prince's Young Empire Music Group. She released her first mixtape called Beauty & The Streets Vol.1 on September 29, 2009. The mixtape's first single, [...] "Show Me Somethin'" [...] featured Houston-based rapper Bun B and was sent to iTunes in August. The mixtape entered at No. 55 on the Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. Mýa was invited to be a featured guest vocalist on We Are the World 25 for Haiti. In 2010, Variety reported Mýa currently has already completed 10 tracks for her next studio effort with producer Junior Sanchez. No release {{date has been set}} yet but think an electro-dance-rock vibe. Mýa says, [...] "Working with Junior Sanchez is an incredibly creative experiencehe and his team are true musicians, and we have been having so much fun in the studiothe sound is brand new and completely fresh." [...] The songstress was also gearing up for the launch of a brand new single [...] "Love Is the Answer", with Cedric Gervais.

2500|$|In {{relation}} to Gavin's first scenes with Kathy's former husband Phil, {{it was said}} that Gavin [...] "will not be taking no for an answer" [...] and he [...] "doesn't take things quietly", with Treadwell-Collins calling the storyline [...] "a really exciting thriller". Further scenes between Phil and Gavin prompted Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy to think that Phil [...] "may have met his match". A show insider told Inside Soap, [...] "He's not afraid to get his hands dirty, even [...] it means butting heads with the notorious Mitchell family. Phil should watch out—this one's a real handful!" [...] On the storyline where Gavin has Phil kidnapped and demands money to spare his life, an EastEnders insider told Inside Soap, [...] "Gavin knows which buttons to push to frighten Kathy into doing exactly what he wants. He wants that money, he wants her by his side, and if things don't go as he wants, Phil is going to pay a high price." [...] Treadwell-Collins said of the kidnap storyline: [...] "What Gavin does to Phil while he's off screen will take Phil in a whole new direction that will run <b>into</b> <b>next</b> year [...]" [...] Taylforth confirmed that what Gavin does to Phil is the reason Phil starts drinking again, saying [...] "Gavin knows that drinking is Phil's weakness". This has an ongoing impact on Phil and the Mitchells, with Treadwell-Collins calling Phil [...] "a broken man" [...] and confirming it was the start of a storyline that would continue until Easter 2016. The Daily Mail said, [...] "Gavin exploited Phil's weakness for alcohol, forcing him to consume booze and setting him off on a potentially deadly slippery slope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other unique {{themes are}} things like [...] "Garfield's Believe it or Don't", [...] "Garfield's Law", [...] "Garfield's History of Dogs", and [...] "Garfield's History of Cats", which show science, history, {{and the world}} from Garfield's point of view. Another {{particular}} theme is [...] "National Fat Week", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and [...] "kicking Odie <b>into</b> <b>next</b> week". Soon, Garfield realizes that [...] "Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food," [...] (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself). A {{few days after the}} storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a [...] "nagging feeling I'm forgetting something," [...] with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is [...] "Splut Week", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia 'splut', hence the name.|$|E
