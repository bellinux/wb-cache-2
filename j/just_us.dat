25|$|By 1967, several changes {{had taken}} place to the state route designations in the area. North of Montpelier, VT 12 was {{relocated}} to use the Montpelier-Morrisville State Highway. The original VT 12 alignment north of Montpelier was split into two routes. The Montpelier-Hardwick segment was assigned {{as an extension of}} Vermont Route 14, while the Hardwick-Barton segment was re-designated as Vermont Route 16. The Barton-Newport segment, which overlapped with U.S. Route 5, became <b>just</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 5. VT 16 was later extended along old VT 56 to its current northern terminus at VT 5A.|$|E
25|$|The highway was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} Route 39 in the state highway renumbering in 1927. The route remained intact, receiving a concurrency through the two communities when U.S. Route 206 {{was assigned}} in the mid-1930s. The two routes remained intact until the state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953, when Route 39 was decommissioned in favor of <b>just</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 206. The highway was bypassed in 1957, with Route 206 heading {{to the outside of}} the communities. The original alignment became Route 170, and lasted until 1986, when it was removed from the state maintenance. The state turned the alignment over to Burlington County, who re-designated it as County Route 690.|$|E

500|$|RCA {{issued an}} Alabama Greatest Hits {{compilation}} in January 1986, which went over five times platinum, making the band {{the most successful}} country act of the 1980s. The Touch followed in September 1986, and although {{considered one of the}} weakest in the band's catalogue, it did have two number one hits: [...] ""You've Got" [...] the Touch" [...] and [...] "Touch Me When We're Dancing". Their next record, <b>Just</b> <b>Us,</b> received a similar critical response, but produced two number ones: [...] "Face to Face" [...] and [...] "Fallin' Again". [...] They also contributed their vocals to [...] "Deep River Woman", a single by Lionel Richie, from Richie's third solo album Dancing on the Ceiling. [...] Released in December 1986, the single peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and number 71 on the Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be <b>just</b> <b>us.</b> It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E
500|$|... …And Justice for All is a musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was <b>just</b> <b>us</b> really showing off {{and trying to}} show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E

500|$|On 13 December 2012, {{the group}} posted a lyric video of [...] "Change Your Life" [...] on their Vevo account. It was {{originally}} {{speculated that the}} music video would have visuals reflecting the theme of self-belief and overcoming self-doubt. On 15 January 2013, Jade Thirlwall told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that the music video will showcase Little Mix's individual personalities, [...] "We always want our videos {{to be the best}} we can do," [...] Thirlwall explained. She also revealed that the video will be more mellow and real than the group's previous music videos. [...] "We're just chilling and portraying the song and performing it how it should be; there are no fireworks or backflips, it's <b>just</b> <b>us</b> delivering a great song," [...] Thirlwall added. Little Mix wanted to showcase who they are with the video by centering it more around themselves than in previous music videos. The official music video for [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was set to be released on 18 January 2013, but it premiered on Vevo on 31 January instead. It was filmed in two days. Scenes from the video were filmed at the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl when the group were performing a show there as part of their DNA Tour at the end of January in 2013. A spokesman for the theatre said, [...] "We are very proud to be featured as part of Little Mix's 'Change Your Life' video and feel it's a huge achievement for the Rhyl Pavilion". The video features cameos from Jade Thirlwall's mother, Norma Thirlwall, and Perrie Edwards' mother, Debbie Dufty. Norma Thirlwall said, [...] "After a while, everyone forgot the cameras were there, so it looks really natural". Following a product placement deal brokered by Starcom MediaVest's content division, Liquid Thread, the video also sees the Samsung Galaxy features exclusivity in its technology category. Andrew Wynd, head of media, corporate marketing for Samsung Electronics, opined, [...] "It has been fantastic to be able to seamlessly showcase some of [...] functionality in the Little Mix video."

In June 1876, shortly after the first concentrated National Liberal cabinet came to power, he and Nicolae Fleva spearheaded the effort to prosecute the former [...] "White" [...] Conservative ministers. In opening the case, Ghica stated: [...] "It wasn't <b>just</b> <b>us</b> who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on them, and we are the expression of that blame". The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, who was called in for questioning. The attempt to stage a trial was ultimately defeated by moderates in Ghica's own party, who ignored his vocal protests.|$|E
2500|$|HR {{holds that}} the {{therapeutic}} [...] "working through" [...] of personal issues from the past to achieve wholeness is unnecessary.

According to HR, one's [...] "issues" [...] and memories are just thoughts, and the individual can react to them or not.

2500|$|On September 21, Clementi {{complained to}} a {{resident}} assistant {{and two other}} officials that Ravi had used a webcam to videostream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote [...] "I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner." [...] Clementi wrote in detail on the <b>Just</b> <b>Us</b> Boys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and we go to a club. The best part about it was <b>just</b> <b>us</b> coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E
