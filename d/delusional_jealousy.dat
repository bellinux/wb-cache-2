50|$|Morbid jealousy (also {{known as}} Othello {{syndrome}} or <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy)</b> {{is an example}} of the suspicious version of this disorder where a person is preoccupied with the thought that their spouse or sexual partner is being unfaithful without having any real proof, along with socially unacceptable or abnormal behaviour related to these thoughts. The most common cited forms of psychopathology in morbid jealousy are delusions and obsessions. It is considered a subtype of delusional disorder.|$|E
50|$|Extreme obsessions: {{much time}} {{is taken up}} by jealous concerns, {{and there is a}} great {{difficulty}} in putting the concerns out of the mind. Impairment of the relationship, limitation of the partner's freedom and checking on the partner's behavior may occur. Although a distinction was occasionally difficult to make, the categories of ‘psychotic’ (<b>delusional)</b> and ‘neurotic’ <b>jealousy</b> contained similar proportions (each between one-third and one-half).|$|R
50|$|Obsessions: the individual's own {{thoughts}} are egodystonic; they are acknowledged to be senseless, and usually resisted. Jealous thoughts are experienced as intrusive and excessive, and compulsive behavior such as {{checking up on}} their partner may follow. Egodystonicity (the distress caused by thoughts that are unwanted and viewed as contrary to conscious wishes) generally varies a large amount between patients and “a continuum from obsessional to <b>delusional,</b> which morbid <b>jealousy</b> has been suggested” (Insel & Akiskal 1986).|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of psychosis in schizophrenia {{has sometimes been}} linked to {{a higher risk of}} violent acts. Findings on the specific role of delusions or hallucinations have been inconsistent, but have focused on <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> perception of threat and command hallucinations. It has been proposed that a certain type of individual with schizophrenia may be most likely to offend, characterized by a history of educational difficulties, low IQ, conduct disorder, early-onset substance misuse and offending prior to diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Violence {{can occur}} in any {{relationship}} tainted with jealousy, either normal or morbid jealousy. In {{a recent study of}} jealousy by Mullen & Martin in 1994, 15% of both men and women reported that at some time they had been “subjected to physical violence {{at the hands of a}} jealous partner.” Culturally, jealousy may be even used to “justify violence towards partners.” Victims in a homicide case are most likely to be current or ex-partners, in both female and male perpetrators.When a partner repeatedly denies infidelity this may provoke anger and extreme violence. On the other hand, the partner that is suffering may give up and give a false confession, which in turn most likely will provoke rage in the jealous individual. In the US a sample was taken of 20 participants with <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy.</b> 19 were male and Silva (1998) found that 13 had threatened to kill their spouse because of their perceived infidelity. Of the 13 males, 9 actually attacked their spouse. Out of the 20, a weapon was used by 3 of them, and 12 had harmed their spouse. [...] A presence of paranoid delusions and hallucinations of injury to the spouse were most often associated with violence. This suggests that individuals that suffer from <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> that partake in violence may be solely driven by psychotic phenomena. A higher risk of assault was associated with alcohol consumption.|$|E

40|$|Jealousy is {{a complex}} emotion {{characterized}} by the perception of a threat of loss of something that the person values,particularly in reference to {{a relationship with a}} loved one, which includes affective, cognitive, and behavioral components. Neural systems and cognitive processes underlying jealousy are relatively unclear, and only a few neuroimaging studies have investigated them. The current article discusses recent empirical findings on <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> which is the most severe form of this feeling, in neurodegenerative diseases. After reviewing empirical findings on neurological and psychiatric disorders with <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> and after considering its high prevalence in patients with Parkinson's disease under dopamine agonist treatment, we propose a core neural network and core cognitive processes at the basis of (<b>delusional)</b> <b>jealousy,</b> characterizing this symptom as possible endophenotype.

40|$|Although obsessive jealousy is {{a highly}} {{disturbing}} disorder, frequently it goes unrecognized, as most {{attention is paid to}} <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> being the more prominent clinical phenomenon. In order to distinguish obsessive from <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> the basic clinical characteristics of these two types of jealousy are presented, as well as the mechanism of their respective genesis, and the differences which we must be aware of in order to prevent misdiagnosis and consequent wrong treatment choices. The theoretical considerations are supported by case presentations providing a clear picture of the phenomena discussed. Unlike <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> characterized by the presence of strong, false beliefs that the partner is unfaithful, individuals with obsessive jealousy suffer from unpleasant and irrational jealous ruminations that the partner could be unfaithful, accompanied by compulsive checking of partners’ behaviour, which is recognised by the patient as ego-dystonic. This jealousy resembles obsessive-compulsive phenolmenology more closely. Despite the differences, both forms of jealousy result in significant distress for patients and intimate relationships, and carry the risk of abuse, homicide and/or suicide. <b>Delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> is a psychotic disorder and should be treated mainly with antipsychotics, while obsessive jealousy resembles obsessive-compulsive disorder and should be treated with SSRIs and cognitive-behavioural therapy. Regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} insight into the disorder, one of the key factors in the treatment of pathological jealousy is to motivate the sufferers for pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Parkinson's disease (PD), {{commonly}} {{defined as}} a hypokinetic movement disorder, is hampered {{by the appearance of}} motor complications (MC), including dyskinesias and motor fluctuations, and non-motor symptoms such as behavioral, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders, which, in the last years, are gaining increasing attention. The factors affecting MC and these non-motor symptoms are still largely unknown and their interactions; are not yet fully evaluated. Objective: To identify the presence of behavioral, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders in PD patients with and without MC and to evaluate their association with MC. Methods: Consecutive PD patients received a comprehensive structured clinical evaluation including pharmacologic treatment, MC and non-motor symptoms such as reward-seeking behaviors, neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, psychoses and hallucinations) and dementia. Results: 349 patients were included in this analysis. Patient with MC showed enhanced frequency of dementia (p< 0. 001), anxiety, depression and psychoses (p< 0. 01). A higher frequency of impulse control disorders was detected in patients with dyskinesias (22. 2 % - p< 0. 001) and motor complications (12. 2 % - p< 0. 05). Dyskinesias were significantly more present in patients with hypersexuality (p< 0. 05) and compulsive shopping (p< 0. 001), while they were not significantly associated with pathological gambling and binge eating. Patients with dyskinesias also had significantly higher frequency of dopamine dysregulation syndrome, hallucinations and delusions (p< 0. 001), with the exception of <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Discussion: We found a higher frequency of behavioral, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders in patients with MC. The lack of detection of dyskinesias in several PD patients with pathological gambling in our study represents a very interesting issue. While binge eating mainly seems {{to be related to the}} use of dopamine agonists, the significant lack of association between dyskinesias and <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> suggests the hypothesis of a possible underlying psychopathological predisposition rather than a mere pharmacologic effect in PD patients with these behavioral complications.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: <b>Delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> (DJ) {{has been}} {{described}} in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on dopaminergic therapy, but a role for dopaminergic therapy in DJ has not been established. METHODS: The current cross-sectional study on DJ investigated its association with dopaminergic therapies compared with their associations with hallucinations and its prevalence in PD patients. Eight hundred five consecutive patients with PD were enrolled between January 2009 and June 2010. RESULTS: DJ was identified in 20 patients (2. 48 %) and hallucinations in 193 patients (23. 98 %). In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, dopamine agonists {{were significantly associated with}} DJ (odds ratio, 18. 1; 95 % CI, 3. 0 -infinity; P =. 0002) but not with hallucinations (odds ratio, 0. 73; 95 % CI, 0. 49 - 1. 10; P =. 133). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dopamine agonist treatment represents a risk factor for DJ in PD independent of the presence of a dementing disorder, and the presence of this additional nonmotor side effect should be investigated in this clinical population. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society...|$|E
40|$|Leuchine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2) gene {{mutations}} are {{a common}} cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson disease (PD).

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the G 2019 S frequency in a series of 58 familial and 70 sporadic PD patients recruited from Campania, a region in Southern Italy. We identified one heterozygous G 2019 S mutation in a PD patient who also suffered from obsessive disorder and depression and presented hallucinations and <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> while he was treated with l-dopa, pramipexole, and amantadine. Brain (18) F-deoxy-glucose PET showed relative decrease of glucose metabolism in the caudate nuclei and to a lesser extent in cortical parietal/frontal regions. The patient's mother also had PD and molecular analysis demonstrated that she carried the same mutation.

40|$|Among all {{the forms}} of mental extremity, {{paranoia}} and schizophrenia seem to be dominant in North American metafiction. The word {{and the concept of}} paranoia are among the most controversial in the history of psychoanalysis. Although etymologically paranoia means madness or disorder of the mind, J. Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis define it as a "chronic psychosis characterized by more or less systematized delusion, with a predominance of ideas of reference but with no weakening of the intellect [ [...] . ]. Along with delusions of persecution, Freud places erotomania, <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> and delusions of grandeur under the heading of paranoia " (296). It is important to stress that unlike schizophrenia, whose fundamental symptom is Spaltung ("dissociation, " "splitting") and whose typical characteristics include incoherence of thought, action and affection, paranoia is not accompanied by intellectual deterioration (Laplanche and Pontalis 298 - 9; 409). What is more, the paranoid's frenzied production of references and connections could result in an uncontrolled acceleration of the intellect.

40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) {{may present}} <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> (DJ). In a {{previous}} cross-sectional prevalence study we identified 15 cognitively preserved and five demented PD patients with DJ. The current study aimed at evaluating their clinical (motor and non-motor) characteristics and the pharmacological treatments associated with DJ, and its subsequent pharmacological management. Patients were assessed by neurologists and psychiatrists using the Hoehn and Yahr scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Efficacy of DJ management was evaluated in follow-up visits. All patients were in therapy with dopamine agonists. A subgroup of five cognitively preserved patients developed DJ {{after a short}} period of treatment of therapy with dopamine agonists, while other patients developed DJ after a longer period of dopaminergic treatment. Psychiatric comorbidities were common in cognitively preserved and in demented patients. The pharmacological management included the interruption of dopamine agonists in two patients and the reduction of dopamine agonist dose plus the use of antipsychotics in other patients. These clinical data suggest that the management of medicated PD patients should include investigation for the presence of DJ and the evaluation of clinical characteristics potentially relevant to the prevention or the early recognition of delusions.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{describe}} a rare {{case of a}} patient who developed psychotic symptoms after a right stroke that disappeared with antipsychotic treatment, but appears to need low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy. Case description: A 65 -year-old man presented at the psychiatric emergency service {{with a history of}} persistent <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy,</b> visual illusions and agitation with onset about 1 month after a right posterior cerebral artery ischemic stroke. These symptoms only disappeared with therapeutic dosages of an antipsychotic drug (3 mg/day of risperidone). At 2 -year follow-up, he no longer had delusional activity and the antipsychotic treatment was gradually discontinued over the following year. However, 1 week after full cessation, the patient once more became agitated and suspicious and was put back on risperidone at 0. 25 mg/day, resulting in rapid clinical remission. One year after the return to low-dose risperidone, the patient's psychopathology is still under control and he is free from psychotic symptoms. Comments: Psychosis is a relatively rare complication after stroke. To our knowledge, no cases of post-stroke psychosis that apparently require continuous low-dose antipsychotic treatment have been reported to date. Our case suggests that low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy may be needed for certain patients with post-stroke psychosis, especially for those with risk factors and non-acute onset...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> or Othello {{syndrome}} (OS) is a well-described psychiatric disorder with paranoid features {{reported in}} both organic and functional psychoses. In organic psychoses, the disorder occurs more frequently among chronic male alcoholics and in demented patients. To date, only 2 anecdotal cases of OS {{have been reported}} in Parkinson disease (PD) during dopaminergic treatment. Objective: To investigate the presence of OS in PD patients and to study the relationship between dopaminergic treatment, avoiding the possible influence of dementia. Methods: Five hundred sixty-three PD patients without dementia encountered in Our movement disorders practice were included in the study, All patients who developed OS were studied. Relationships between clinical and familial history and dopaminergic therapy and OS were assessed. Results: Six patients with OS were identified. They were all male, with a relatively recent diagnosis of PD characterized by mild-moderate motor deficit. Dopaminergic treatment had been prescribed at low dosages. Neither confusional states (including agitated confusion) nor delirium were associated with OS. The disorder became manifest mainly at time of introduction/increment of antiparkinson treatment. Invariably, OS decreased or receded after reduction/suspension of the antiparkinson drug and prescription of an atypical neuroleptic, usually clozapine or quetiapine. Conclusion: We hypothesize that nondemented PD patients affected by OS do not necessarily present with severe motor complications and may well have a biologic predisposition for psychiatric disorders. In our opinion this paranoid delusion is rarely considered in PD...|$|E
40|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} {{are recognized}} as {{an important step in}} the treatment of psychotic disorders. An atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, is a D 2 and 5 -HT 2 receptor blocker which is commonly used due to its lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms (1, 2). Increased appetite, weight gain and sedation are among the most common side effects of it, whereas, the incidence of risperidone-induced enuresis is under 1 % (3, 4). Despite being a quite rare side effect, nocturnal enuresis reduces compliance to medication (2, 5). Not only the patient but also all family members may be negatively affected by enuresis nocturna (6). Enuresis caused by risperidone with the use of mood stabilizers or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children is discussed in the literature as case reports (4, 7). Here, we aimed to present a psychotic patient with nocturnal enuresis during his treatment with risperidone. CASE A 35 -year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital due to <b>delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> going on for approximately one year, in which he thought his wife was cheating on him with another man. In his psychiatric assessment, there were no other delusions or hallucinations.

In the 20 th day of his treatment, the patients ’ delusional symptoms regressed however urinary incontinence symptoms were seen 4 - 5 times per week. According to the results of urology and internal medicine consultations, no organic pathology was detected. Then, risperidone was suspected for the occurrence of nocturnal enuresis in this patient.

40|$|Background: Jealousy in {{a sexual}} {{relation}} has some advantage that it ensures propagation of one’s own gene as put by evolutionary psychologists. However, if this belief is based on unfounded evidence it may impair the relationship between partners and may be extremely distressful. Morbid jealousy may present as obsession, overvalued idea, or delusion {{as one of the}} symptoms in different psychiatric disorders. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} find the frequency of patients with morbid jealousy presenting in the Department of Psychiatry of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), the psychiatric diagnoses of such patients, frequency of different forms of morbid jealousy (obsession, overvalued idea, and delusion). Also, to assess predisposing or triggering factors for jealousy and to assess for suicidality in such patients and their partners. Materials and methods: All patients attending the Department of Psychiatry, PMCH were administered a screening questionnaire and if they qualified they were further administered the operational criteria for morbid jealousy. The psychiatric diagnosis was confirmed with the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD- 10 : DCR). Each patient was then administered a rating scale to quantify the psychopathology. Results: Out of 970 patients who attended outpatient department, 658 patients were administered the screening questionnaire, 174 qualified who were later assessed with the operational criteria for morbid jealousy. Fifty patients who fulfilled the criteria were assessed. The mean age of presentation for both sexes were 36. 44 year (SD= 13. 12 years). Morbid jealousy was found to be twice as common in males as compared in females. Highest prevalence was found among participants who had higher secondary education, belonged to middle socioeconomic status, and having psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia followed by depression. <b>Delusional</b> <b>jealousy</b> was the commonest followed by overvalued idea and obsession. A total of 20 % of patients reported substance abuse like alcohol, cannabis, nicotine etc. either currently or in the past. Triggering factors found were spouse working away from home, interaction with opposite sex, attractiveness as perceived by the person with morbid jealousy. Females either as patients of morbid jealousy or as partners of a morbidly jealous spouse, carried the higher risk of suicide as compared to males...|$|E
