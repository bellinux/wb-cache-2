5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day. Police were lying in wait and arrested both Power and Williams at the Moorgate station. Police covered Williams's head with an apron to prevent him from being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses. However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an <b>identity</b> <b>parade.</b> Power was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives {{concluded}} that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it {{for at least some}} of that time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an <b>identity</b> <b>parade,</b> he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
25|$|Alfred Richardson {{had turned}} his {{attention}} to the Police <b>Identity</b> <b>Parade.</b> These had been held for many years by police forces, but there was no standard procedure or rules (such as a minimum number in a line up) that was followed. Halifax was the first Police Force whereby all those taking part had to be of similar likeness and build as the person arrested. The number of individuals in any Parade had to be the same wherever the Parade took place. This was adopted throughout the country and is still used today. At this time Richardson became the secretary of the Chief Constables Association of England and Wales and in 1917 he became Vice President and 1918, President.|$|E
50|$|To ensure {{fairness}} and reliability, {{there are certain}} recognised procedures for <b>identity</b> <b>parades.</b> The police also have standing rules to govern identity-parade procedures. Nowadays <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> are often videotaped to minimise disputes about what occurred in or was established by them. Some specially-fitted identity-parade rooms have one-way glass so that witnesses do not feel intimidated by confrontation with possible suspects. Sometimes <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> are not possible or feasible, in which case photo parades take place. For the suitable conditions for photo parades, see S v Ndika.|$|R

25|$|On 14 November 2001 at Lewes Crown Court, {{the jury}} heard from several {{witnesses}}. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother {{who had seen}} a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Roy Whiting when he was selected for an <b>identity</b> <b>parade.</b> One of Payne's shoes was found {{by a member of}} the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered. A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Richardson, in his {{position}} as Chief Constable, issued instructions about introducing, the Keep Left Rule, Traffic Signals and the Police <b>Identity</b> <b>Parade.</b> All motor and horse drawn traffic must drive on the Left hand side of the road. This was mandatory and not optional. Coloured lights at busy road junctions were introduced into Halifax, {{being one of the}} first Boroughs to do so. There were two lights for each road, one red for Danger (red as it was considered to be the best colour to penetrate fog and haze) and green for Go. These two colours were used by the railways and instantly recognizable by the population. They were attached to tram poles and hand operated by a Constable. This is thought to be possibly one of the first uses of traffic lights in the country. London had used semaphore signals, the first sited at Charing Cross, but they were never considered to be effective.|$|E

5000|$|Video Identification Parade Electronic Recording (VIPER) is {{a digital}} system for {{conducting}} <b>identity</b> <b>parades.</b> Rather than recruit {{a group of}} volunteers who resemble a suspect, police officers can retrieve a selection of pre-recorded video recordings of people unrelated to the case under investigation.

Campbell's wife, Margaret had {{opened the door to the}} gunman and his {{accomplice}} when they had come looking for her husband. She had got a good look at the two men, who drove off in a Ford Cortina after the shooting, and although she identified Jackson as the killer at an <b>identity</b> <b>parade,</b> murder charges against him were dropped on 4 January 1974 at Belfast Magistrates' Court.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, {{a man was}} arrested, {{detained}} from 2–4 May for {{in excess}} of 48 hours and wrongfully accused of murder. The man was autistic, and the police failure to handle such a case sparked controversy. According to the police, the suspect made a written confession of an assault that contradicted severely with statements obtained whilst interviewed with family members. A nursing home later offered the suspect an alibi, corroborated with video evidence, that the man {{could not have been}} at the alleged crime scene. Civil rights activists condemned the incident which traumatised a vulnerable individual, and criticised the police procedures including not proposing legal representation, lengthy detention, an methods for obtaining a bogus confession. The police chief expressed [...] "regret" [...] but refused to make an apology. Also in May 2015, police procedures for conducting identity parades attracted controversy when suspects in an assault case on television reporters were allowed to wear shower caps and face masks during an <b>identity</b> <b>parade,</b> ostensibly to cover distinctive features, leading to the police abandoning the case due to insufficient evidence. The police stance was confirmed by the new Chief Commissioner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} morning, Nodder {{was placed}} in an <b>identity</b> <b>parade,</b> {{and each of the}} witnesses who had seen Mona on 5 and 6 January did not hesitate to pick him out as the man they had seen in her company. Confronted with both these positive identifications and the successive pieces of evidence being discovered at his home, Nodder changed his story as to his actions on 5 January. In his initial statement, given on the evening of 8 January, Nodder claimed he had encountered Mona by chance outside her school, and that the child had asked him to take her to visit her aunt (Edith Grimes) in Sheffield in order that she could see her newborn cousin, whom she had not yet seen. Reluctantly, he had agreed to Mona's request, as he had expected to see Mrs. Grimes the following day (the pair having an agreement to meet once a week in their affair). He had therefore persuaded Mona to spend the evening at his home, before giving the child two shillings and placing her on a bus to Sheffield the following evening, with instructions—both verbal and written—as to how to reach her aunt's home. This arrangement would therefore ensure Nodder's home was empty when Mrs. Grimes visited him at their pre-scheduled meeting time. Nodder further stated Edith Grimes could assist with the case, adding she had known his address but alleging she had withheld this information from the police. (Edith Grimes admitted to police she and Nodder had engaged in an affair, but indignantly denied his other claims and accusations.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Devlin Committee was a UK {{committee}} {{based on}} the Devlin report of 1976, which looked {{at a number of}} criminal cases in order to draw conclusions on the method of visual identification of suspects. The committee was established to follow on from the investigations into the wrongful accusation of Adolf Beck by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1907. The Devlin report submitted to the committee was made after a number of cases where <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> led to the mis-identification of a suspect. These included Adolf Beck, Oscar Slater, Luke Dougherty and Laszlo Virag, cases ranging from 1908 to 1972.|$|R
50|$|While in {{detention}} at Arbour Hill Prison, he {{was subjected to}} a number of <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> and identified as being the man who had held up a motor cyclist outside 38 Mount Street, Dublin where Lieutenant Ames, a suspected intelligence officer was killed. He strongly protested his innocence of involvement in that incident on Bloody Sunday. He claimed he was at Mass in Blackrock (over four miles from the scene of the shooting) at the time. Several witnesses supported this alibi evidence but it was false. However, witnesses including a church rector, attested that the claim by soldier witnesses to have known the time by the chiming of the church bell revealed that the bell had not chimed for years.|$|R

40|$|The {{vestibular}} organs, {{providing the}} sense of balance and acceleration, have dense neuroanatomical connections. Stimulation of these organs elicits widespread changes in cortical blood flow, including regions active during face perception and recognition. Previous studies report improved face recognition in acquired prosopagnosia following vestibular stimulation and an enlarged N 170 in healthy adults. The present study explores the effect of pioneering caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) in the behavioural performance of healthy adults during face recognition tasks. Sixty {{participants were asked to}} identify the nationality of celebrities in four testing sessions following an ABAB design. A significant main effect of stimulation demonstrated improved accuracy during those sessions with CVS. The findings have immediate real-world value in settings that require superior face recognition skills such as passport control and <b>identity</b> <b>parades.</b> The study also provides further evidence to the efficacy of vestibular stimulation in modulating cognitive processes...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1970, Dolan and {{his band}} were {{performing}} at the Wookie Hollow Club in Liverpool. Dolan {{and a member of}} his road crew stayed in the venue for drinks and to chat to their fans. Some people at a nearby table were attempting to bully the (by now closed) bar into providing them with champagne. Dolan joked that they should come back in a few hours for a [...] "champagne breakfast". The men took exception to this and became abusive. Dolan and his companion tried to leave but were prevented from doing so. During the following fracas Dolan was headbutted, (breaking his nose) kicked, punched and slammed into lavatory fittings and a wall in a sustained attack which was only halted when the sound of police sirens could be heard. It took six weeks for the singer to recover well enough to return to work. The club was sued but went into liquidation. The police attempted to identify the perpetrators and held <b>identity</b> <b>parades</b> which Dolan attended but no-one was ever prosecuted.|$|R

25|$|Alfred Herbert Richardson (1874–1951) was an English policeman. He {{joined the}} Birmingham City Police in 1890. He {{achieved}} very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became Chief Constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully {{applied for the}} Chief Constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained {{until his retirement in}} 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the formalisation of procedures for police <b>identity</b> <b>parades,</b> making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his time. He came from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851–1938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871–1952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929. Thus three members of the Richardson family served as chief constables between 1902 and 1920. He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.|$|R
