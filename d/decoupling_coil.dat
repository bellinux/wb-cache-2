40|$|Phased array surface coils offer high SNR {{over a large}} {{field of}} view. Phased array volume coils have high SNR at the surface and centre of the volume. Most array coil designs {{typically}} employ a combination of geometrical and additional techniques, such as isolating preamplifiers for element-to-element decoupling. The development of array coils for small animal MRI is of increasing interest. However isolation preamplifiers are expensive and not ubiquitous at the field strengths typically employed for small animal work (4. 7 T, 9. 4 T, etc). In addition, isolating preamps complicates the designs of coils for transmit SENSE since they do not decouple during transmitting. Therefore, this thesis reexamines a "tried and true" method for <b>decoupling</b> <b>coil</b> elements. In this work five different coils for mouse imaging at 200 MHz are presented: a 16 leg trombone design quadrature birdcage coil and four geometrically decoupled volume phased array coils. The first mouse array coil is a two saddle quadrature coil with a circularly polarized field. The second coil is a four channel transmit/receive volume array coil that is decoupled purely geometrically, {{without the need for}} other forms of decoupling. The third array coil is a modified 'open' configuration to facilitate the loading of animals. The fourth coil presented is a 'tunable' <b>decoupling</b> <b>coil,</b> where the geometric decoupling between elements is 'tunable', in order to compensate for different loading conditions of the coil. Tunable decoupling between elements was achieved using two mechanisms, a decoupling paddle for isolation of top to bottom elements, with a variable overlap mechanism for decoupling diagonal elements. Bench measurements demonstrate good decoupling (better than - 20 dB) of the coil elements and 'tunability' of both mechanisms. Phantom images from all coils are presented...|$|E

However, it is technically very challenging to design efficient high-frequency phased arrays for small-diameter, vertical-bore magnets, especially since standard decoupling methods, such as impedance mismatched preamplifiers, cannot be easily in-tegrated. A four-coil phased array was constructed for micro-imaging at 600 MHz, and sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) reconstructions of spin-echo and echo-planar im-ages of the mouse brain were performed to reduce imaging time and susceptibility artifacts, respectively.

40|$|With {{the current}} {{surge in the}} {{development}} and use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) due to increased environmental consciousness, methods to increase the driving range and improve the battery charging conditions of these vehicles have become important research areas. Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) is one of the solutions to the challenges currently faced by EV manufacturers and customers. IPT is a method that is used to transfer power over large air gaps and has proven to be efficient, reliable and convenient in the charging of electric vehicles and also for factory automation systems and charging of consumer devices such as mobile phones. In some cases, it necessary to have transmitter and receiver topologies having multiple coils especially in a three phase IPT highway system or a table top IPT system for charging many consumer devices or mobile phones at the same time. Multi coil topologies are also used in lumped charge pad topologies to enable better misalignment tolerances. In such cases it is necessary to mutually <b>decouple</b> these multiple <b>coils</b> to avoid interactions that could affect the efficiency of power transfer. The current state of the art systems offer solutions that lead to the <b>decoupling</b> of multiple <b>coils</b> by their relative spatial position, and are hence limited. Multi coil systems operating at the same frequency also generate magnetic fields that add or cancel out each other, thereby changing the air gap magnetic field orientation depending on which coil is powered. A multi frequency IPT system developed in this thesis aims to provide a solution to the above challenges. A multi coil primary system with two coils carrying currents of different frequencies can be designed to transfer power independently without interactions between the two different frequency systems. This thesis develops this concept by first investigating the need for <b>decoupling</b> multi <b>coil</b> transmitter and receiver designs. Multi frequency IPT is then introduced and the design considerations are developed in order to achieve a frequency decoupled IPT system. Experimental results of the proposed multi frequency method using two transmitter coils are also presented.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{define the}} {{clinical}} and prognostic role of MR in a pediatric population with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Fifteen children underwent MR 12 hours to 2 months postinjury using <b>decoupled</b> surface <b>coils</b> and ventilator support as needed.

RESULTS: On MR, {{of seven children}} with spinal cord neurologic deficits, four had hemorrhagic contusions, one had nonhemorrhagic contusion, one had extensive infarction, and one revealed a normal cord. All had persistent deficits on hospital discharge. Eight without cord neurologic deficit revealed no cord lesions on MR; this group included two with epidural hematoma, four with ligamentous disruption, and two with bone compression. CONCLUSIONS: Children may have extensive cord contusion and / or infarction with minor, remote, or no fracture dislocation.

40|$|Conventional proton (1 H) {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is generally insensitive to the lung due to the low tissue density and other complicating factors. On the other hand, inhaled inert fluorinated gas MRI is a promising technique for functional lung imaging, since it can visualize {{the distribution of the}} inhaled gas. To better understand and develop this novel technique, a vast number of pre-clinical animal experiments are required for validating and optimizing the radio frequency (RF) coils that are used to acquire MRI data. The simplest approach would be to use single-tuned coils (i. e. RF coils each tuned to a single resonance frequency), such that a 1 H coil is used to obtain anatomical information, while a separate 19 F coil is used to obtain functional lung information. Unfortunately, this approach also requires image registration (i. e. co-alignment of separate images) in order to combine the information from the 19 F and 1 H coils. The purpose of this thesis is to eliminate the need for image registration by developing an optimized 1 H/ 19 F dual-tuned coil for rodent lung imaging and disease model investigation. Our initial design was a coil-inside-coil (CIC) approach with geometric decoupling of the 1 H and 19 F resonators. Using the CIC approach, two independent coils are positioned concentrically with each other. The inner coil is then rotated until the position inducing the minimum voltage level is found. This method is restricted to linear mode RF <b>coils</b> because geometrical <b>decoupling</b> cannot be performed in quadrature mode due to reflection of RF power resulting in a poor signal to noise ratio (SNR). Our next approach was to construct a single birdcage coil dual-tuned to 1 H- 19 F frequencies. This was done by taking the advantage of the fact that birdcage coils inherently have two orthogonal channels that are electrically invisible to each other. Because the 1 H and 19 F nuclei have close resonant frequencies at 3 T (127. 74 MHz and 120. 15 MHz), each channel can be tuned to be on resonance for one frequency. The coupling between the two channels was quantitatively measured and compared to geometrically <b>decoupled</b> <b>coils</b> demonstrating the differences in decoupling performances. The advantage of this coil is that it assures identical B 1 field profiles for the two nuclei, and slightly increased the filling factor for 1 H resulting in improved SNRs. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that because 1 H and 19 F channels are orthogonal to each other, neither can be built to operate in a quadrature mode. In our final approach, a switch-tuned quadrature coil was built which can be switched to resonate at either the 1 H or 19 F frequencies. PIN diodes are used to actively control the switching between the two frequencies. This method enables the combination of the benefits afforded by using a quadrature coil (i. e. factor of 2 increase in SNR) and those of the dual tuned coil (i. e. the ability to switch frequencies on the fly without having to physically change coils and move samples, animals or patients from their anatomically localized positions). Using this switch-tuned coil, quantitative lung ventilation imaging can take place investigating various new imaging pulse sequences and disease models. B 1 field mapping, B 1 homogeneity and the uniform distribution of the currents on both fluorine and proton channels were measured...|$|R

The current flows over the flat-strip were computed, it showed that a significant increase of current close to the edges. This result agrees with theory.

40|$|Dynamic nuclear {{polarisation}} is {{a technique}} that allows one to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in an NMR experiment substantially, by transferring the inherently larger electron polarisation to the nuclei. Quantum mechanical models of this effect have thus far been limited to the description {{of only a few}} nuclei. This is due to the exponential scaling of the matrices involved in the description of the system. In this thesis methods of reducing the state space needed to accurately describe the simulation of solid effect DNP were explored and tested. Krylov Bogoliubov averaging has been used to remove high frequency oscillations from the system Hamiltonian and confine the trajectory of the dynamics to the zero quantum coherence subspace. Truncation of the basis spanning the Liouville space to low spin correlation orders has been tested and a condition for a minimum truncation level was found. A strategy based on a projection method, which allows one to describe the spin polarisation transient with multi-exponential functions, is introduced. This results in a linear scaling of the propagator with the number of spins. The influence of the parameters involved in the solid effect on the dynamics of the polarisation build up is discussed.

The model includes electromagnetic and gas-dynamic forces but excludes energy conversion from radial motion to axial motion, {{with the intention of}} characterizing thrust efficiency loss mechanisms that result from a conical versus a at inductive coil geometry. The range of conical pulsed inductive thruster geometries to which this model can be applied is explored with the use of finite element analysis. A semi-empirical relation for inductance as a function of current sheet radial and axial position is the limiting feature of the model, restricting the applicability as a function of half cone angle to a range from ten degrees to about 60 degrees. The model is nondimensionalized, yielding a set of dimensionless performance scaling parameters. Results of the model indicate that radial current sheet motion changes the axial dynamic impedance parameter at which thrust efficiency is maximized. This shift indicates that when radial current sheet motion is permitted in the model longer characteristic circuit timescales are more efficient, which can be attributed to a lower current sheet axial velocity as the plasma more rapidly <b>decouples</b> from the <b>coil</b> through radial motion. Thrust efficiency is shown to increase monotonically for decreasing values of the radial dynamic impedance parameter.

40|$|A novel active {{shimming}} {{method is}} {{proposed for the}} correction of magnetic field nonuniformity of superconducting (SC) magnet for magnetic resonance imaging. Active shimming utilizes several coils to correct specific field harmonic components appear in the inhomogeneous field, and each coil is usually designed independently to the others, and also takes no account {{of the presence of}} the main magnet coil blocks. However, the magnetic coupling among these SC shim coils exists, and also the interaction between those zonal even-order shim coils and the main magnet are particularly significant. This coupling/interaction can lead to the drift of main field and even a possible destruction of shim coils by quench due to tremendous energy transferred from the main magnet. In this paper, we attempt to develop magnetic decoupling technologies for the reduction of magnetic interactions between the shim coil and main magnet. Specifically, a hybrid optimization algorithm, including linear and nonlinear programming, is proposed to design a set of decoupled even-order zonal shim coils. The linear programming determines the globally optimal topology and preliminary position of the shim coils. Then, the nonlinear programming is applied to further optimize the position and the turn number of the shim coils, ensuring the designed coils are capable of correcting the unwanted field deviation. Taking the example of Z 2 shim coil, compared with the conventional Z 2 shim coil, the proposed method significantly reduces the mutual inductance between the Z 2 shim coil and the main magnet. For the same field deviation in the tested case, the mutual inductance has been decreased from 83 to 2. 3 H. We also further analyze the influence of system parameters and main magnet structure on the optimal topology of decoupled Z 2 shim coil. Z 4 and Z 6 shim coils are also designed with excellent decoupling effect.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{focuses on}} the transceive phased array designs for {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI). With the introduction of phased array technology in MRI, {{a wide variety of}} phased array coils have been constructed for human clinical applications or small animal studies. Compared to receive-only phased array coils, transceive phased-arrays combine the function of the transmit coils and receiver coils. They have the capability of generating a homogeneous magnetic field and detecting the MRI signal with a high signal-noise-ration (SNR). Operations at high field have the advantage of being able to enhance the SNR and gain a high spectral resolution. However, to realize the full benefits of high field parallel MRI, current radio frequency (RF) technology still needs improvements and many technical challenges need to be overcome, such as providing an optimized engineering solution which balances the RF magnetic field penetration, coil sensitivity, coupling/decoupling and B 1 field homogeneity. Moreover, in some applications, such as in a small animal system, the limited space within small animal systems makes it difficult to incorporate both transmit and receive coils. In this thesis, these issues concerning transceive systems are explicitly optimized for RF performance through a number of proposed novel and effective hardware solutions. An inverse method for the design of phased-array is described and applied to the design of asymmetric, unshielded RF array coils. This method expands the geometry of arrays from conventional cylinders to part-spheres, cone and ellipsoid shapes that conform more closely to the anatomy under study. The research work developed and presented in this thesis has been applied to two specific RF coil applications, human breast imaging and small animal imaging. Firstly, for transceive RF breast coils design, a two-loop array coil has been designed and optimized to improve the homogeneity of the B 1 field. Secondly, a hybrid structured design of the breast array coil has been proposed for the improvement of the overall RF field performance, especially the superior-inferior area of the breast, which is a problematic area for the conventional breast coil. Finally, a single-turn solenoidal transceive breast coil design for a bilateral breast MRI has been introduced. For small animal MRI in a high field application, three dedicated, shielded eight-element transceive volume-arrays for large rat MRI applications has been designed and two have been constructed. Several techniques and methods have been proposed and employed for the array design to help to improve the coil RF penetration depth and the signal reception capability, and also to minimize the mutual <b>decoupling</b> between adjacent <b>coil</b> elements. As an important accessory of the phase array system, a high power eight-channel T/R switch unit is also designed and fabricated. Both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated the technical potential of the proposed transceive phased-array technology for high-field human and small animal MRI applications...|$|R
