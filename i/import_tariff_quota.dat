40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{existing}} theory on the equivalence of <b>import</b> <b>tariff</b> and <b>quota.</b> If the equivalence is defined {{on the domestic}} price level (weak equivalence), then either the zero conjectural variation for domestic country or a perfectly competitive market will be sufficient to support this equivalence. If the equivalence is defined both on the same domestic price level as well as tariff rate (strong equivalence), then the conditions are that either domestic country acts as a Cournot competitor and foreign country is a price taker, or both domestic and foreign country are price takers. An empirical spatial-equilibrium trade model is constructed to simulate the impacts of <b>import</b> <b>tariff</b> and <b>quota.</b> Using Taiwan¡¦s rice import as an example, the empirical results show that if Taiwan switches from the <b>quota</b> system to <b>tariff</b> system, the domestic rice price as well as total social welfare can be increased given the same import volume.

40|$|Although many {{countries}} have adopted freer trade regimes {{or are in}} the pro-cess of reforming quantitative restrictions, such reforms are not without short-term costs. Sudden removal of quantitative restrictions can release a surge of demand for imports that can deplete foreign exchange reserves and force rapid adjustment by domestic industries. Five methods to more gradually liberalize quantitative restrictions are discussed: raising quota ceilings until they are non-binding; eliminating quotas product by product; converting <b>quotas</b> to equiva-lent <b>tariffs</b> and then reducing them; auctioning quota licenses; and converting <b>quotas</b> to <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas,</b> and then liberalizing these.

Welfare comparisons boil down to sourcing costs comparisons. Quotas tend to dominate at high domestic prices, ad valorem tariffs at intermediate prices and specific tariffs at low domestic prices. Welfare maxima are achieved with more restrictive policies than under perfect competition. These results rationalize separate negotiations for sensitive products in the Doha Round and the setting of tariff-rate quotas that mimic import quotas for these products. Finally, in ascertaining the robustness of our policy ranking to the choice of variable anchoring the comparisons, we found that specific tariffs unambiguously dominate ad valorem <b>tariffs</b> and <b>quotas</b> when government revenue or imports anchor the comparisons.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is aimed at}} understanding why border trade policies are today complemented with behind-the-border policies like output subsidies, R&D subsidies, and public R&D investments. This is {{a new type of}} protectionism that becomes prominent since the 2006 - 2008 economic crisis. In this paper we analyze the impact of various policies on domestic cost-reducing research and development (R&D) expenditures using an international duopolistic model with uncertainty regarding the result of the R&D process. We examine the impact of “at-the-border” policies (<b>import</b> <b>tariffs,</b> <b>import</b> <b>quotas,</b> voluntary export restraints, and minimum price agreements) as well as “behind-the-border” policies (output subsidies, R&D subsidies, and public R&D investments). We demonstrate new theoretical findings, in particular the increasing then decreasing impact of quotas on R&D, as well as the impact of production subsidies, public R&D investments, and minimum price agreements on private R&D. We conclude that R&D subsidies are appealing policy instruments because they support not only domestic R&D expenditures but also domestic production and profits without reducing consumers’ surplus.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of trade {{restrictions}} on competition in oligopolistic markets. Quantitative restrictions, such as VER's (Voluntary Export Restrictions) are shown to affect {{the extent to which}} foreign firms can compete in the domestic market, and hence to raise the equilibrium prices and profits of both domestic and foreign firms [...] when such restrictions are not too severe. This increase in prices and profits is shown to make it unlikely for VER's to raise National Welfare. In addition, I show that domestic output may fall due to the VER's. For these reasons, VER's {{do not seem to be}} desirable ways of restricting <b>imports.</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and <b>Quotas</b> are also shown to be non-equivalent in such oligopoly models. A comparison of the effects of <b>tariffs</b> and <b>quotas</b> shows that it would be in the interest of domesti cmanufacturers t lobby for VER's instead of <b>import</b> equivalent <b>tariffs.</b> In addition, it is shown that the foreign firm would prefer VER's to <b>import</b> equivalent <b>tariffs,</b> even if tariff revenues were refunded to them. Thus, the recent VER's on Japanese automobiles may well have been in the interests of both Japanese and American firms, and at the expense of the nation as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the economic impact on the least developed countries (LDCs) of reduced trade barriers in their export markets. 48 countries are currently designated as “least developed” by the United Nations. We study the consequences of removing <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> and <b>quotas</b> on the imports of products from these countries in the QUAD-countries (i. e., the EU, the USA, Canada, and Japan), which represent 65 - 75 % of the LDC export market.

We find that the aggregate benefits of duty-free and quota-free access for the LDCs are likely to be modest, even when measured relative to their present low levels of income. The main reasons are (1) that most LDCs presently enjoy quite liberal market access in important export markets, and (2) that the ability of LDCs to take advantage of trade preferences is limited, due to supply constraints and restrictive “rules of origin”...|$|R
