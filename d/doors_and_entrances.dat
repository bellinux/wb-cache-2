By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave.

40|$|Since {{the early}} times of their history, the Muslim {{societies}} knew the waqf system that expanded constantly; various social groups {{participate in the}} expansion of the Awqaf properties, especially traders and rich people. These properties provided a significant help to realize many important social services in these communities, mainly, health care improvement, education, fighting poverty, freeing war captives, and taking care of visitors and guests. During the Islamic Medieval period, the kings, sultans and princes awqaf arose. They competed in leaving their properties for the welfare of their citizens. Among these were the sultans of the Zyanides State who ruled the Central Maghreb, currently named Algeria, between AH 633 - 962 / AD 1235 - 1554. Sultans Awqaf were largely concentrated in the capital of the Zyanides State-Tlemcen. The most famous sultans who contributed in its spreading were Yagmurasn Ibn Ziyan, Abu Hamu Musa I, Abu Tashafeen I, Abu Hamu Musa II. They granted estates and fields of productive trees to mosques, koranic schoold, Zaouïates and students of theology, imams and poor people too. The Islamic Awqaf contributed greatly in the economic, social and scientific development of the Tlemçanian society as well as some other cities in the Central Maghreb. The Awqaf were the most important cause that led to the flourishing of many social and cultural institutions which were providing many social services to the Central Maghreb community. This paper in devoted to the Awqaf of some Sultans of Central Maghreb. To reach this, I relied on some important and documents still not totally exploited in rewriting the history of the region. These documents consist of inscriptions found in many of the mosques and Zaouïates firstly published by Charles BROSSELARD on the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>entrances</b> in several episodes of “la Revue Africaine”. The inscriptions consist of an inventory of all properties granted to these institutions; they make also reference to their location, denomination, and the different social groups benefiting from them...|$|E
