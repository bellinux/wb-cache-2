5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the <b>flesh</b> will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the <b>flesh</b> becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the <b>flesh</b> gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>fleshing</b> waste {{ratio of}} leather {{processing}} is very high, {{that was about}} 70 - 230 kgs/ton of raw material. Those waste containing high amount of protein. The aim of this experiment was to know the influenceof <b>fleshing</b> powder on the increasing of broiler body weight. This experiment was classified into two steps. The first step {{was focused on the}} preparation of <b>fleshing</b> powder. The second step was the application of <b>fleshing</b> powder as protein substitute of broiler feed. The results showed that the quality of <b>fleshing</b> powder prepared by pressurize steaming at 2 atm for 15 min was better than by unpressurized method. The additional and the final weight of broilers feed by <b>fleshing</b> powder were not significantly difference with the control. Therefore, <b>fleshing</b> powder could be used as protein substitute on the prepraration of broiler feed instead of fish powder...|$|R

5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap <b>flesh</b> dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the <b>flesh,</b> and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the <b>flesh</b> and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the <b>flesh</b> to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} {{research}} is to know the growth Aspergillus niger on alternative medium, that are White – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato, Yellow – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato, and Cassava. The method used in this study is experimental research using completely randomized design (CRD) with one factor that is kinds of medium PDA (M 0), medium white – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato (M 1), medium yellow – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato (M 2), and medium cassava (M 3) with using the fungus Aspergillus niger. The inoculation of Aspergillus niger use agar block method which incubated for 3 days with temperature 280 C. The parameter of this research are colony diameter, sporulation, and the color micellium of Aspergillus niger. Data were analyzed with quantitative and qualitative methods. The result of this research showed the growth of Aspergillus niger after incubation during 72 hours, the diameter medium of PDA is 35, 5 mm, medium White – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potatois 39 mm, medium Yellow – <b>fleshed</b> sweet potatois 33 mm and medium of Cassava is 37, 5 mm with dense of sporulation and the best color micellium is media of PDA.

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>fleshing</b> in the leather tannery generates solid waste in theform {{of pieces of}} meat mixed with fat. <b>Fleshing</b> wastes contain {{approximately}} 50 - 80 o% protein and 20 - 40 % fat. Protein from <b>fleshing</b> waste {{can be used for}} animal feed, cornpost and gelatin. The fat {{can be used as a}} base for soap rnaking, fat liquoring at leather tanning processes, and fuel (diesel oil substitute). This research aimed to study the possibility of utilizing fat fron <b>fleshing</b> waste in leather tannery. The result show that fat offleshing waste could be obtained by heating or by mechanical/enzymatic extraction. Fats obtained from <b>fleshing</b> waste were called tallow that had a triglyceride with unsaturated carboxylic acid and considered to be ester group. Ester group could be reacted with bases by saponification reaction to produce soap. Ta use thefat offleshing waste in leather anointment as fat liquoring, then the fat must be sulfonated.

Costly NA encourage the researcher to find the media from easily material, cheap, {{and there was a}} source of nutrients for the growth of bacteria such as cassava, white and yellow <b>fleshed</b> sweet potatoes with high carbohydrate as a source of carbon for bacterial growth. This research was an experimental study using two factor of completely randomized design (CDR). Fist factor was a types of bacteria, such as E. coli (B 1) and Bacillus subtilis (B 2) and the second factor was the types of media, such as NA media (M 0) white <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato (M 1), yellow <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato (M 2) and cassava (M 3). Inoculation used streak plate method which incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours.
