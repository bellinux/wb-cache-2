The transparency of graphene to electrons with energies between 2 and 40 eV has been measured by using an optimized vacuum-triode setup.

25|$|Since the {{conductance}} of {{ionic current}} flow {{is controlled by}} the gate voltage, using a material with high dielectric constant as the wall of the channel is desired. In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance. A channel surface with a low surface charge is also desired in order to strengthen the effect of potential tuning by <b>gate</b> <b>electrode.</b> This increases the ability to spatially and temporally tune the ionic and electrostatic environment in the channel.|$|E
25|$|Polysilicon {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the <b>gate</b> <b>electrode</b> and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E

Qualitative and quantitative changes in the transport characteristics of these devices, {{as a function of}} gate-array voltage, are described. Experiments are reported for two widths of Si nanowires, 40 and 17 nm, and for a varying number of <b>gate</b> <b>electrodes,</b> all spaced at a pitch of 33 nm. We find that these top nanowire <b>gate</b> <b>electrodes</b> can be utilized to locally deplete the carriers in the underlying Si nanowire and thus define an array of coupled quantum dots along the nanowire. Reproducible Coulomb blockade is observed, and clear diamond features are obtained when the conductance is plotted in the plane of the source-drain and gate voltages. The regularity of the diamond diagrams is imposed by the regularity of the SNAP top <b>gate</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Model computations of the electronic structure starting from a tight-biding Hamiltonian in the atomic basis suggest that the control made possible by the top gate voltage induces the emergence (and reversible submergence) of a coupled quantum dot structure in an otherwise homogenously doped Si nanowire.

It used crystalline silicon for the semiconductor and a thermally oxidized layer of silicon dioxide for the insulator.

40|$|To help {{satisfy a}} need for {{high-density}} logic circuits insensitive to radiation, it has been proposed to realize inverse majority gates as microscopic vacuum electronic devices. In comparison with solid-state electronic devices ordinarily used in logic circuits, vacuum electronic devices are inherently much less adversely affected by radiation and extreme temperatures. The proposed development would involve state-of-the-art micromachining and recent advances in the fabrication of carbon-nanotube-based field emitters.
