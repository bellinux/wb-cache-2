30|$|Preceding post-fire assessment, {{information}} on fire progression and intensity may exist if fires were actively managed. Several incident teams may rotate {{in and out}} {{during the course of}} one fire, contributing several sets of fire data that may not be fully integrated after the fact. Many techniques may be used to map the <b>going</b> <b>fire,</b> including nighttime thermal infrared imaging and daytime aerial observation, so data may not be standardized overall. The information can be useful for post-fire assessment, but caution should be exercised if applied to research or long-term management as quality and content can be variable, while sufficient documentation of methods may be lacking.|$|E
40|$|Since {{fighting}} fires {{can pose}} a great {{risk to the}} lives of firefighters, {{it is important to understand}} how they perceive risks in dynamic wildfire situations. The aim of the current study was to determine whether career and volunteer firefighters differ in their perception of the risk of a going vs. contained fire and whether descriptions of a fire as either going or contained affected perceptions of risk. It was expected that career firefighters would rate a contained fire as significantly riskier than would volunteer firefighters. The sample consisted of 55 career and 84 volunteer CFA Victorian firefighters (134 males and 5 females). An ambiguous wildfire scenario was presented and described as either going or contained and risk ratings were recorded. Two-way ANOVA results showed that career firefighters rated a <b>going</b> <b>fire</b> as equally risky as a contained fire. On the other hand, volunteer firefighters perceived a fire described as contained to be significantly less risky than a fire described as going, despite the fact that the same fireground conditions were described in both cases. It was concluded that a framing effect had occurred and that career firefighters demonstrated a higher level of situation awareness than volunteer firefighters due to their heightened levels of risk perception when exposed to contained wildfire scenarios. A practical implication of the current research is that those conducting firefighting briefings need to be aware of possible framing effects in the way information is presented to firefighters and need to ensure that all briefings make risks cognitively salient to firefighters. <br /...|$|E
