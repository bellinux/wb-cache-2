5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is an <b>extension</b> of the London Underground {{to serve}} the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, {{it appears to be}} considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile tunnelled <b>extension</b> would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed <b>extension</b> would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground <b>extension,</b> which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} <b>extension</b> {{was designed}} in 1889 by John Whitelaw.

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for an <b>extension</b> of the City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process}} of constructing an <b>extension</b> to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The <b>extension</b> plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant that it had to be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the <b>extension</b> as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E

These <b>extensions</b> preserve many properties of the original uniform algebra. In this paper, we study general uniform algebra <b>extensions</b> and the properties of these <b>extensions.</b> We then introduce a class of <b>extensions</b> that share some characteristics of Cole's construction, and show that these <b>extensions</b> preserve certain properties of the original uniform algebra.
