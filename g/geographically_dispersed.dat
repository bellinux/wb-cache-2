LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at <b>geographically</b> <b>dispersed</b> locations within the region.

5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with <b>geographically</b> <b>dispersed</b> wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E

The discovery of communities that are <b>geographically</b> <b>disperse</b> stems from the requirement to identify higher-level organizational structures, such as a logistics group that provides support to various <b>geographically</b> <b>disperse</b> terrorist cells.

To address the problem of finding <b>geographically</b> <b>disperse</b> communities, we modify the well-known Louvain algorithm to find partitions of networks that provide near-optimal solutions to this quantity. We apply this algorithm to numerous samples from two real-world social networks and a terrorism network data set whose nodes have associated geospatial locations. Our experiments show this to be an effective approach and highlight various practical considerations when applying the algorithm to distance modularity maximization. Several military, intelligence, and law-enforcement organizations are working with us to further test and field software for this emerging application...|$|R

It is evident that the Guru Granth record is an accurate rendition of what Namdev wrote: the oral tradition probably accounts significantly for the changes and additions that {{appear to have been}} made by that time. The numerous subsequently produced manuscripts also show variant texts and additions that are attributed to him.

25|$|Buoyed by {{the recent}} victory in the Binh Gia {{campaign}} {{and the support of}} their major allies, North Vietnamese leaders began preparing a strategy to defeat South Vietnamese and United States military forces. Lê Duẩn, Secretary of the Communist Party, believed that the South Vietnamese regime was able to survive because they still had a strong army to rely upon. Therefore, to win the war and reunite the country, the South Vietnamese military had to be destroyed completely. Lê Duẩn believed the Communist forces must destroy three or four of South Vietnam’s nine regular army divisions in a series of large battles, and pin down the eleven elite battalions of the South Vietnamese strategic reserve. Thus, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a summer offensive with the objective of defeating the South Vietnamese army by drawing them into battle repeatedly with numerous, <b>geographically</b> <b>dispersed</b> attacks.|$|E
25|$|After the Tennessee General Assembly {{enacted a}} 1905 law to {{segregate}} Nashville's streetcar system, local black leaders {{were determined to}} protest the law through a boycott of the public transportation system. When the law first {{went into effect in}} July, the boycott was effective, as few blacks were riding streetcars. Boyd, then head of the local chapter of the National Negro Business League, joined with other prominent citizens to promote and formalize the boycott. Because many blacks needed the streetcar system to travel to and from work, it proved difficult to maintain participation in the boycott. To help their fellow black citizens avoid using Nashville's public streetcars, Boyd joined with lawyer James C. Napier and funeral home director Preston Taylor to establish a rival black-owned public transit system, the Union Transportation Company. The new company began service on September 29, 1905, operating five steam buses. These vehicles lacked the power needed to climb some of the city's hills, so the company acquired a fleet of 14 electric buses. To avoid buying electricity from a white-owned utility, the transportation company powered the buses with a generator {{in the basement of the}} Publishing Board building. The company had limited financial resources, was not able to effectively meet the transportation needs of Nashville's <b>geographically</b> <b>dispersed</b> black population, and was handicapped by a tax on electric streetcars that the city of Nashville enacted in 1906 specifically to combat the black-owned business. The Union Transportation Company went out of business within a year, by which time the boycott had been largely abandoned. Although the boycott was ultimately unsuccessful, its long duration was one source of inspiration for bus boycotts in the 1950s.|$|E
