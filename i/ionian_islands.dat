5|$|A death {{certificate}} discovered in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The {{death certificate}} also indicates {{that he was a}} British subject and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the <b>Ionian</b> <b>islands,</b> the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
5|$|From May 1864, George {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the Peloponnese, through Corinth, Argos, Tripolitsa, Sparta, and Kalamata, where he embarked on the frigate Hellas. Proceeding northwards along the coast accompanied by British, French and Russian naval vessels, the Hellas reached Corfu on 6 June, for the ceremonial handover of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> by the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Storks.|$|E
5|$|The Theme of Cephallenia (θέμα Κεφαλληνίας, thema Kephallēnias), {{controlling}} the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> {{was established in}} the mid- to late 8th century, to protect imperial communications with Italy and defend the Ionian Sea from Arab raids. The new imperial possessions in Apulia were added to it in the 870s, before they were made into a separate thema (that of Longobardia) in about 910.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> sought not only to deny their use to the French, but also to foster Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire, with whom Britain was still at war. Local Greek nationalists and brigands were formed into the 1st Greek Light Infantry under John Oswald and later Richard Church. This was the first modern independent Greek military unit, and its existence encouraged other Greek nationalists to join the British forces in the region, forming the core {{of what was to}} become the United States of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands.</b> Troop withdrawals late in 1809 delayed any further invasions until March 1810, when Collingwood's temporary successor Thomas Byam Martin detached a squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet for an operation against Santa Maura. Landings were effected on March 22, and the island surrendered on April 16 after an eight-day siege of the principal fortress, the attackers considerably aided by the desertion of the garrison's native Greek troops to Oswald's Greek Light Infantry.|$|E
5|$|The navy {{enjoyed a}} major {{comeback}} under the ambitious emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180), who used it extensively {{as a powerful}} tool of foreign policy in his relations with the Latin and Muslim states of the Eastern Mediterranean. During {{the early years of}} his reign, the Byzantine naval forces were still weak: in 1147, the fleet of Roger II of Sicily under George of Antioch was able to raid Corfu, the <b>Ionian</b> <b>islands</b> and into the Aegean almost unopposed. In the next year, with Venetian aid, an army accompanied by a very large fleet (allegedly 500 warships and 1,000 transports) was sent to recapture Corfu and the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> from the Normans. In retaliation, a Norman fleet of 40 ships reached Constantinople itself, demonstrating in the Bosporus off the Great Palace and raiding its suburbs. On its return voyage however it was attacked and destroyed by a Byzantine or Venetian fleet.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} regimental {{promotion to}} major in the 28th Foot on 9 May 1816. The regiment moved to a garrison posting in the <b>Ionian</b> <b>islands</b> in 1819, and {{his time in the}} islands saw him command a force which put down a local rising on Santa Maura. On 2 September 1819 he purchased the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel and command of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders. His tenure at the 92nd was short and contentious; since it was garrisoned in Jamaica, he did not actually join the regiment until October 1820, and then scandalised his officers and men by his approach to regimental traditions. He appeared on parade in a cocked hat rather than the conventional highland bonnet, and attempted to order the regiment to wear trousers rather than the kilt. The Duke of York quickly arranged for his transfer to a less sensitive role, and he was transferred to command the 90th Light Infantry, a Lowland—and safely trousered—regiment, on 9 August 1821. The 90th were in the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> where Stovin had been posted some years earlier, but his second tour was substantially quieter; he saw no further active service before he retired from the 90th on half-pay on 23 April 1829. For his services there, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E
5|$|The British {{presence}} in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 {{with the arrival of}} the frigates HMS Amphion under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an immediate impact with a series of raids in the Dalmatian and <b>Ionian</b> <b>islands.</b> In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by despatching the frigates Danaé and Flore from Toulon. HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe side of it has the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view, holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws. The <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> formed part of the Venetian maritime trade route to the Orient.|$|E

50|$|The {{project on}} the <b>Ionian</b> <b>island</b> of Zakynthos was the {{original}} project. The groups founders, Dimitris and Anna Margaritoulis, began collecting data here in the late 1970s and from those initial studies the group grew.|$|R
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Greek War of Independence in late March 1821, some Greek military leaders recognised the Muslim-Albanian menace around Lalas and the possibility of coming to the aid of the coreligionists, the Ottoman Turks. As a result, the local Greeks initially attempted to siege the Muslim Albanians of Lalas but were not successful. Shortlybafter on May 13, a small force of Greek soldiers occupied a mountainous position near Lalas. Their position was vulnerable and likely to fall until the appearance of 500 volunteers of Ionian Islanders from Cephallonia and Zakynthos and their four cannons. The Zakynthian volunteers were led by Dionysios Sembrikos. On May 30 the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Island</b> force had grown with the arrival of fighters from Elis and Kalavryta. The combined Greek force endeavoured to surround Lalas. The Muslim Albanians of Lalas realised their difficult position and were shocked by the number and organisation of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Island</b> volunteers. Some of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Island</b> volunteers are likely to have received training in Western military tactics and organisation. The other Greek rebels were also impressed with the organisation of the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Island</b> force. Despite some disagreement between the Ionian Islanders and the Peloponnesians on the timing of their attack on the trapped Muslim-Albanians, the Ionian Islanders {{sent a letter to the}} Muslim-Albanians allowing them to surrender peacefully or be attacked and given over to the Peloponnesians. The letters was signed by Dionysios Sembrikos and the Zakynthian Panagtios Strouzas. However, this attempt at resolving the stalemate was indecisive.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{object in}} the British Library is the Perkins D {{cylinder}} press developed by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819.

5|$|The main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were {{deployed}} in the Ionian Sea. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> and the four fortresses of Butrinto, Parga, Preveza and Vonizza on the Albanian and Greek coasts. In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of Paxi, Santa Maura, Theaki, Cephalonia, Zante and Cerigo, capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October. Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the main town. Although the town was besieged, operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing Généreux to successfully break out and reach Ancona. By {{the end of the}} year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural range}} of Potamon fluviatile is highly fragmented, and covers parts of many {{countries}} with a Mediterranean coastline.

It is also found {{on a number of}} islands, including Sicily, Malta and Gozo, the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> Aegean Islands, Sporades and Andros in the Cyclades. Although the species as a whole is widespread, it is declining in numbers, and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|Vertzami is a thick, dark-skinned grape variety, {{best known}} for single-varietal wines {{produced}} on the <b>Ionian</b> <b>island</b> of Lefkada.

50|$|Andreas Laskaratos (Ανδρέας Λασκαράτος; 1 May 1811 - 23/24 July 1901) was a satirical {{poet and}} writer from the <b>Ionian</b> <b>island</b> of Cefalonia (or Kefallinia), {{representative}} of the Heptanese School (literature). He was excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church because his satire targeted many of the church's prominent members.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} development around 1803, was {{the formation}} of a 1,200 strong militia recruited from all classes of the islands. Some members of the old <b>Ionian</b> <b>Island</b> elite resisted arguing that only peasants should be subject to military obligations. However, it was finally passed in the Ionian Assembly.|$|R
5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the 92nd Gordon Highlanders at Jamaica—where he scandalised his regiment by ordering them to adopt trousers {{instead of the}} kilt—and the 90th Light Infantry in the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> before retiring from active duty in 1829. He then held a number of administrative roles in Ireland, including the state secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant and the commissioner of police in Ulster, and after the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 became a palace courtier. His final military role was the (ceremonial) colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment, which he held from 1848 until his death.|$|E
5|$|George's {{reign of}} almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was {{characterized}} by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands</b> peacefully, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. Compared to his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine, Alexander, and George II proved short and insecure.|$|E
5|$|Lefkada, {{part of the}} Despotate of Epirus {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362. The Despotate of Epirus {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central <b>Ionian</b> <b>Islands,</b> it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. Lefkada, however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
