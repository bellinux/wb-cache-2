Analogous to proliferating terrestrial wireless sensor networks, massively distributed space sensor networks will enable the observation of real-time multi-point phenomenology. For example, an ionospheric plasma <b>depletion</b> <b>sensor</b> network would shed light on “plasma bubbles” accepted {{as the cause of}} satellite navigation and communication signal scintillation at low latitudes in the post-dusk sector. Economics dictate a low-cost, massproducible sensor node for this prospective class of space mission.

Here we give a brief overview of the contribution of various mitochondrial and other organellar channels to cancer cell proliferation or death. Much attention is focused on channels involved in intracellular calcium signaling and on ion fluxes in the ATP-producing organelle mitochondria. Mitochondrial K+ channels (Ca 2 +-dependent BKCa and IKCa, ATP-dependent KATP, Kv 1. 3, two-pore TWIK-related Acid-Sensitive K+ channel- 3 (TASK- 3)), Ca 2 + uniporter MCU, Mg 2 +-permeable Mrs 2, anion channels (voltage-dependent chloride channel VDAC, intracellular chloride channel CLIC) and the Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP) contribute importantly to the regulation of function in this organelle. Since mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis, modulation of their ion channels by pharmacological means may lead to death of cancer cells. The nuclear potassium channel Kv 10. 1 and the nuclear chloride channel CLIC 4 as well as the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) -located inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor, the ER-located Ca 2 + <b>depletion</b> <b>sensor</b> STIM 1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), a component of the store-operated Ca 2 + channel and the ER-resident TRPM 8 are also mentioned.

40|$|Disaster {{prevention}} {{in civil}} infrastructures requires {{the use of}} techniques that allow temperature and strain measurements in real time over lengths of a few meters to tens of kilometres. The distributed Brillouin sensor (DBS) technique has the advantage to combine all these characteristics. The sensing mechanism of the DBS involves the interaction of two counter-propagating lightwaves, the Stokes and the pump, in an optical fibre. Spatial information is obtained through time domain analysis. The sensing data are recorded from the measurement of the pump depletion. We explore the benefits and the drawbacks of this approach and show that there is a power range for which the sensing performances are optima. To achieve that goal, Brillouin fibre generator (BFG) and amplifier (BFA) were studied leading to the derivation of a threshold definition for the BFA, which is the configuration of the DBS. Within that context, numerical and analytical models describing the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) interaction are introduced and validated experimentally. Even if pump depletion is carefully controlled, the Brillouin spectrum shape, and hence the sensor performance, still depend on the sensing parameters such as power, pulse and fibre characteristics. We use a signal processing method grounded in the physics of Brillouin scattering. An analytical approximation, valid for the optimum sensing region, reconstructs the Brillouin spectrum distribution from input sensing parameters and measured data. These data are obtained with a spectrum analysis methodology, based on three original tools: the Rayleigh equivalent criterion, the lengthstress diagram, and the spectrum form factors. This methodology has been successfully used on experimental spectra. The DBS and the signal processing approach were then used to monitor the structural changes in steel pipes and in a composite column, all subjected to heavy loads. The DBS measured the strain distribution of those structures while they were stressed. The DBS provided detailed information on the structure's health at local and global level, associated with deformations, cracks and buckling. This work demonstrates that the DBS is capable of extracting critical information useful to engineers: engineer's experience and judgement in conjunction with appropriate data processing methods make possible to anticipate structural failures.

40|$|A key {{functionality}} of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consists in}} obtaining and transporting the information of interest (e. g., event/status) {{required by the}} applications. The applications running on WSN also specify desired reliability levels on the desired information. Consequently, reliability requirements, possibly changing over time and of tunable levels over an application, are stipulated on the transport of information. As the WSN environments are often exposed to perturbations (e. g., energy <b>depletion,</b> <b>sensor</b> and connectivity loss etc), these specifically {{need to be considered}} in order to achieve the desired reliability on information transport. The existing approaches to reliable transport typically focus on maximizing the attained reliability levels than the more complex facets of reliability adaptation or tunability. These approaches thus tend to over utilize the network resources (e. g., energy) even when the application does not require enhanced reliability. On this background, this thesis develops a novel generalized framework for reliable information transport in WSNs. The proposed framework supports various applications, provides tunable reliability of information transport and copes with dynamic network conditions. To ascertain the fundamental issues dictating the reliability of information transport in WSNs, this thesis models and compares existing information transport techniques. We highlight the key problems with the existing techniques and provide solutions to achieve desired application requirements. The generic information transport framework developed in this thesis comprises of flexible and modular architectural blocks where different existing approaches can be easily incorporated. To maintain the generality of the framework we classify WSN applications and devise their information model. We achieve tunable reliability using probabilistic forwarding and opportunistic suppression of the information. For the detection of information loss, a hybrid acknowledgment technique is proposed which efficiently combines implicit and explicit acknowledgments. To ensure end-to-end reliability we develop heuristics to allocate reliability across the hops and tunable retransmission mechanism at each sensor node. In addition, if the sensor nodes know the spatial correlation of the information, they adapt the number of retransmissions according to the number of source nodes. Furthermore, congestion control is necessary in order to ensure the tunable reliability. We propose proactively detecting the congestion by observing the input and output information flow across a node. When congestion is detected, we propose mechanisms to split the information flow on multiple paths to alleviate congestion. If the congestion persists the information rate is adapted by the sensor nodes. Our simulation results in the standard sensor network simulator TOSSIM show that the proposed framework supports various applications with evolving reliability requirements, copes with dynamic network properties and outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. Our framework also significantly reduces the number of transmissions to result in an efficient solution...|$|E

It re-entered Earth's atmosphere and burned up over Africa on December 7 at approximately 19:51 UT (2:51 p.m. EST) at an estimated location of 16.4 N, 18.6 E. The probe returned telemetry for about 25 hours of its 38-hour-6-minute journey. The other 13 hours were blackout periods due to the location of the two tracking stations. The returned information showed that the internal temperature remained at about 43 °C over most of the period.While Pioneer 3 did not meet its primary mission objective of a lunar flyby, the data obtained was of particular value to James Van Allen. The Pioneer 3 probe data in addition to the data from the previous Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 satellites led to the discovery of a distinct second radiation belt around the Earth. The trapped radiation starts at an altitude of several hundred miles from Earth (where the outer belt was first observed by Sputnik 2 and Sputnik 3) and extends for several thousand miles into space. These Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth are named for Dr. James Van Allen, in honor of his discovery.|$|R

Under the Bid and Rescue algorithm, sensor nodes assess the message forwarding load they experience and estimate the lifetime that their battery power will allow under such a load.

This property is important since it prolongs the networks lifetime by avoiding early energy <b>depletion</b> of <b>sensors.</b> We first present a basic algorithm that in each step probabilistically decides whether to propagate data one-hop towards the final destination (the sink), or to send data directly to the sink. This randomized choice balances the (cheap, but slow) one-hop transmissions with the direct transimissions to the sink, which are more expensive but “bypass ” the sensors lying close to the sink and propagate data fast. Note that, in most protocols, these close to the sink sensors tend to be overused and die out early. By a detailed analysis we precisely estimate the probabilities for each propagation choice in order to guarantee energy balance. The needed estimations can easily be performed by current technology sensors using simple to obtain information. Under some assumptions, we also derive a closed form for these probabilities. The fact (shown by our analysis) that direct (expensive) transmissions to the sink are needed only rarely, shows that our protocol, besides energy-balanced, is also energy efficient. We then enhance this basic result with some recent findings including a generalized algorithm and demonstrating the optimality of this two-way probabilistic data prop...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} few years {{wireless}} sensor networks have received a greater interest in application such as disaster management, border protection, combat field reconnaissance and security surveillance. Sensor nodes are expected to operate autonomously in unattended environments and potentially in large numbers. Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. The data communication and various network operations cause energy <b>depletion</b> in <b>sensor</b> nodes and therefore, it is common for sensor nodes to exhaust its energy completely and stop operating. This may cause connectivity and data loss. Therefore, it is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate measures are taken to sustain network operation. In this paper we survey cellular architecture and cluster-based to sustain network operation in the event of failure cause of energy-drained nodes. The failure detection and recovery technique recovers the cluster structure in less than one-fourth of the time taken by the Gupta algorithm and is also proven to be 70 % more energy-efficient than the same. The cluster-based failure detection and recovery scheme proves to be an efficient and quick solution to robust and scalable sensor network for long and sustained operation. In cellular architecture the network is partitioned into a virtual grid of cells to perform fault detection and recovery locally with minimum energy consumption. Fault detection and recovery in a distributed manner allows the failure report to be forwarded across cells. Also this algorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be more energy efficient...|$|R
40|$|Sensors in a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) probe their surroundings and report their findings to a base-station over multi-hop paths. Given {{the important role of}} the base-station, an adversary who likes to disrupt the network operation would eagerly look for where the base-station could be and target it with attacks in order to inflict maximum damage. Unfortunately, the continuous flow of traffic towards the base-station creates a pronounced pattern of wireless links that may expose the base-station position and thus make the network more vulnerable. This thesis investigates means for boosting the anonymity of the base-station. First, we adapt three models -Entropy based model, GSAT test and Evidence theory model, to quantify anonymity of the base station. Then, two novel approaches for boosting the anonymity of the base-station are proposed. One is for the base-station to disguise itself by transmitting some of the data packets it receives with varying intensity. The goal is to create a perception that the base-station node is just another sensor node sending some information and thus confuse the adversary. Another approach is for the base station to relocate itself to a more concealed position within the network. Relocating the base station completely scraps/nullifies the adversary's efforts to track it down and forces him to start his search from scratch. This thesis investigates the problem of base station relocation with respect to when to relocate, where to relocate and how to relocate. These approaches are validated through simulation. Our results show that the proposed measures not only safeguard base station but also increases the lifetime of the WSN due to uniform energy <b>depletion</b> of <b>sensor</b> nodes...|$|R
