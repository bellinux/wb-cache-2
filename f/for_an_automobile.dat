5|$|In 1912, Hill {{moved to}} Hastings, Nebraska, {{where he went}} to work <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> dealership. In his job, he {{traveled}} throughout central Nebraska; in the course of this, he spoke with many collectors and investigated possible Pike sites. When he reached a managerial position at the dealership, he recruited his salesmen to bring him reports on archaeological sites and collections.|$|E
5|$|J. R. Miller, relying {{more and}} more on Pflueger's {{hard-working}} energy, social conviviality and artistic talent, gave him a wide variety of assignments including designs <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> showroom, a firehouse and a number of private homes. Pflueger extended his proposed styles to include Aztec elements and Spanish Colonial Revival themes, the latter favored by several clients for their homes.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{was at a}} high level <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> of this era. These features included a heater, theft-proof locks, rotary door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted ignition switch that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiments}} {{showed the}} Stirling engine {{could be better}} to power an extended-range electric vehicle rather than serving as the primary power <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile.</b> The Spirit with the Stirling engine was better suited to run at a constant power setting, {{in contrast to the}} internal combustion engine with its easy throttle regulation over a wide range. Although successful in the MOD 1 and MOD 2 phases of the experiments, cutbacks in funding further research and lack of interest by automakers ended possible commercialization of the Automotive Stirling Engine Program.|$|E
25|$|The {{trademark}} Volvo (which is Latin for I roll) {{was first}} registered by SKF on 11 May 1915 {{with the intention}} {{to use it for}} a special series of ball bearing for the American market but it was never used for this purpose (however in the application for the trademark, it was also designated for the purpose of automobiles). The SKF trademark as it looks today was used instead for all the SKF-products. Some pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured but never released to the market, and it was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, now as a trademark and company name <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile.</b>|$|E

25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out footrest is a recliner. A permanently fixed chair in a train or theater is a seat or, in an airplane, airline seat; when riding, it is a saddle or bicycle saddle; and <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile,</b> a car seat or infant car seat. With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair {{for two people}} is a 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or if is not upholstered, a bench. A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E
25|$|Other {{residents}} use bicycle {{infrastructure in}} the area such as the neighborhood's class three Arterial Bike Route: 14th Street, 'BikeLink' bicycle lockers at the nearby 12th Street /City Center, 19th Street, and Lake Merritt BART Stations, and numerous city-installed bike racks to which they can lock their bikes. A Bicycle Rental business rents bikes by the hour nearby on the East side of Downtown. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan, and Oakland's Measure DD park improvement plan for Lake Merritt calls <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> lane reduction and re-striping of bike lanes onto two of the district's streets: Lakeside Drive and Madison Street, and on nearby Webster and Franklin Streets, North of 14th Street. The plan also calls for the installation of a separated class one bikeway and multi-use trail immediately {{around the perimeter of}} Lake Merritt, and class two bicycle lanes on all arterial streets surrounding the lake, such as Grand Avenue, between Harrison and Macarthur, where a bike lane already exists, and on Lakeshore Boulevard, onto which a bicycle lane has been planned and contracted to be striped.|$|E
25|$|Since the show's debut, {{automobiles}} {{have been}} a signature prize on The Price Is Right. Most hour-long episodes have two pricing games that are each played <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> and in most episodes (although not all), at least one showcase will include an automobile. For special episodes, such as the 5,000th episode, there will often be more cars offered. From 1991 to 2008, almost all automobiles offered on the show were made by companies based in the United States, specifically Detroit's Big Three (although cars made by these companies' foreign subsidiaries or in a joint-venture with a foreign company were also offered). The move was made by Barker, {{in his capacity as}} executive producer, as a sign of patriotism during the first Iraq war in 1991 and as a show of support to the American car industry, which was particularly struggling at that time. When Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form Daimler Chrysler AG (now simply Daimler AG after Chrysler split from the automaker; Chrysler is now controlled by Italian automaker Fiat), the foreign ownership of Chrysler did not affect carrying any Chrysler-related models. Since Barker's retirement, cars made by foreign companies have been offered, most notably Honda, which has several factories throughout Ohio (the home state of Carey and then-announcer Fields). Through product placement, certain episodes in 2008 and 2009 featured Honda as the exclusive automobile manufacturer for vehicles offered on that episode. The major European (Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Fiat and Volvo) and Asian (Hyundai-Kia, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan and Honda) manufacturers have all provided cars on the show since the ban was lifted, with premium foreign cars almost exclusively used for games that generally offer higher-priced cars, such as Golden Road and 3 Strikes. Starting around 2010, vintage and classic cars have occasionally been offered as prizes for games which do not involve pricing them. Among them {{have been a}} 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air and a 1964 Bentley S3. These cars are usually offered in games where their prices are irrelevant to gameplay, such as Hole in One and Bonus Game.|$|E
50|$|Microprocessor {{control of}} a system can provide control {{strategies}} that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. <b>For</b> example, <b>an</b> engine control system in <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load on the engine, ambient temperature, and any observed tendency <b>for</b> knockingâ€”allowing <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> to operate {{on a range of}} fuel grades.|$|R

500|$|By 1930, Strupper and his wife, Odelle, {{had moved}} to Atlanta where he was {{employed}} as the sales manager <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile</b> accessories business. [...] He was also {{a contributor to the}} Atlanta Journal. Although there are competing stories as to the origin of the Red Elephant mascot for the University of Alabama, some sources have cited a story written by Strupper about an October 1930 football game between Alabama and Mississippi. [...] Strupper wrote: [...] "At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity." ...|$|E
500|$|Until mid-decade, all radios in {{automobiles}} used vacuum tubes, but on April 28, 1955, Chrysler and Philco {{announced the}} development and production of the first all-transistor radio <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile.</b> Dubbed the Mopar model 914HR, it was jointly developed by Chrysler and Philco and offered as a $150 option for 1956 Imperial and Chrysler car models. Philco manufactured the radio exclusively for Chrysler at its Sandusky, Ohio plant. [...] A few years earlier in 1952, Blaupunkt {{had been the first}} company to offer FM radio for automobiles, although AM radio still dominated for years to come. Beginning in 1955, Chrysler offered a small phonograph called the Highway Hi-Fi in its luxury cars, which played proprietary seven-inch records. [...] It proved unpopular and was soon discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Thyristors are {{commonly}} used in place of diodes to create a circuit that can regulate the output voltage.
