40|$|Rail and wheel wear is {{a complex}} problem. Lubrication plays an {{important}} role in reducing wear and enhancing asset life. Curves and switches are the areas of major challenges. Tight curves when running dry shows wear rates higher to rapid wear, increased maintenance costs and non-availability of track due to maintenance or replacement. The economic analysis based on cut-off radius, lubricants and applicators takes a very long time using field data. Rail operators often face difficulties when selecting lubricants. Lubricant manufactures use different test standards when specifying lubricant properties. Four-ball test fails to give a meaningful indication of lubricant performance. The result is often a complex decision problem in ranking different lubricants under a particular axel load. An appropriate selection of lubricant <b>for</b> a particular <b>rail</b> <b>application</b> can give financial returns and extension of asset life. An experimental set up has been proposed in this paper. The experimental results are expected to be used for development of models on effective lubrication. This paper proposes experimental setups and methodology for analysis of lubrication effectiveness in heavy haul lines. Theories along with existing research to date relating to ranking of lubricants <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications</b> and a criterion for the ranking is discussed. An analysis is carried out to compare lubricants used in Australian Heavy Haul lines based on manufacturer supplied specifications and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{transportation}} systems {{rely heavily on}} hydrocarbon based internal combustions engines (ICE) as the prime mover of vehicles. <b>For</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications</b> electrification of the route provides an opportunity to improve efficiency and eliminate local emissions at point of use. However, route electrification is not always cost effective for secondary routes which see lower passenger volumes and less frequent trains; there is therefore an increasing interest in railway vehicles being equipped with energy storage based propulsion systems. Most of the railway vehicles that use an electrical traction energy storage system are at a prototype stage. Therefore, long-term real life data for the behaviour of traction batteries is not available up to now. The study {{presented in this paper}} describes ageing characterisation of two battery chemistries (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) and Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP)) <b>for</b> representative <b>rail</b> duty cycles.

40|$|In current non-electrified rail systems {{there is}} a {{significant}} loss of energy during vehicle braking. The aim of this research has been to investigate the potential benefits of introducing onboard regenerative braking systems to rail vehicles. An overview of energy saving measures proposed within the rail industry is presented along with a review of different energy storage devices and systems developed <b>for</b> both <b>rail</b> and automotive <b>applications.</b> Advanced flywheels have been identified as a candidate energy storage device <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications,</b> combining high specific power and energy. In order to assess the potential benefits of energy storage systems in rail vehicles, a computational model of a conventional regional diesel train has been developed. This has been used to define a base level of vehicle performance, and to investigate the effects of energy efficient control strategies focussing on the application of coasting prior to braking. The impact of these measures on both the requirements of an energy storage system and the potential benefits of a hybrid train have been assessed. A detailed study of a range of existing and novel mechanical flywheel transmissions has been performed. The interaction between the flywheel, transmission and vehicle is investigated using a novel application-independent analysis method which has been developed to characterise and compare the performance of different systems. The results of this analysis produce general ‘design tools’ for each flywheel transmission configuration, allowing appropriate system configurations and parameters to be identified for a particular application. More detailed computational models of the best performing systems have been developed and integrated with the conventional regional diesel train model. The performance of proposed flywheel hybrid regional trains has been assessed using realistic component losses and journey profiles, and the fuel saving relative to a conventional train quantified for a range of energy storage capacities and power-train control strategies.

40|$|Hardware-in-the-loop {{simulation}} (HILS) {{is one of}} {{the high-tech}} approaches that combines theory, numerical simulation, software, digital communications, data acquisition, instrumentation and control to give a mechatronic system. Such a system can be utilised to simplify development and design processes for complex systems as well as their testing and validation, which allows reduction or, in some cases, avoidance of the high cost of real field tests. It is well known that the automotive industry has implemented HILS widely in their research projects and investigations, but what is a situation with HILS in railway research? Recent publications [1 – 7] show that the quantity of papers in this field is significantly increased and it is possible to predict that, over the next 5 – 10 years, HILS {{will be one of the}} most required tools <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> vehicle design, much as multibody software is at the present time. For the development of HILS solutions, researchers should have deep multidisciplinary knowledge and a good background in mechanical, electrical and computer science. The components of HILS solutions <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications</b> are almost the same as for automotive ones, but the rail vehicle presents additional challenges as it is more complex and contains many more non-linearities and uncertainties. In addition, the common use of friction damping components in rail suspensions present more challenges to the numerical solvers and calculation speed. One key area of research is how to achieve numerical solutions of existing wheel/rail contact models at sufficient speed for real-time applications. Another issue is how to take into consideration the train dynamics (many vehicles are involved in the train operation process) ? Or more, how to develop a real-time model in order to describe the contact mechanics for pantograph systems and how to test them? The list of uncertainties can become very lengthy...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the new European satellite navigation system Galileo will perform new options for the usage of GNSS in the rail sector. Due to increasing accuracies, more reliable position information and a higher availability Galileo will become a more and more important technical solution <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications,</b> especially <b>for</b> safety relevant applications, such as generating position information for track vacancy proving. Before a new system is set into operation, a certification process takes place. During this process, the overall system and every module of the system have to be validated according to the technical specifications. The easiest way of validation is a static test-period in a laboratory, such as the RailSiTe® of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center in Braunschweig. The RailSiTe® offers the ability to analyse, test and validate systems, subsystems and components of train control equipment. New or modified concepts – either technical or operational – can be investigated {{in order to achieve}} an optimised operation or to increase the operational safety. The test equipment of the RailSiTe® can easily be modified for the testing and validation of navigation systems and applications. This includes the generation of positioning information provided by a GNSS such as the Galileo system. By using such a test setup, only static position information is available. For the {{implementation of}} realistic test conditions it is necessary to generate dynamic position information. This cannot be provided only by a laboratory like the RailSiTe®. Therefore the Institute of Transportation Systems will build up a Road-Rail-Vehicle in the current year. The vehicle is equipped with several navigational sensors, such as a GNSS receiver, a radar sensor, an inertial platform and other sensors for the testing and evaluation of different sensor combinations. These two laboratories – the RailSiTe® and the Road-Rail-Vehicle – will be coupled for testing and validating <b>rail</b> <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> the Galileo system. In the RailSiTe® the application under test will be implemented and developed test sequences will be run through. The trackside infrastructure is given virtually by the RailSiTe®. In addition, the Road-Rail-Vehicle will be driven on an existing railroad while the onboard Galileo receiver is determining the position information. The position information is sent via radio to the RailSiTe® in Braunschweig where it will be included in the testing process. By combining the RailSiTe® and the Road-Rail-Vehicle during the test of a Galileo <b>rail</b> <b>application</b> it is possible to perform laboratory tests under nearly ideal conditions with real dynamic position information...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design evolution process of a composite leaf spring <b>for</b> freight <b>rail</b> <b>applications.</b> Three designs of eye-end attachment for composite leaf springs are described. The material used is glass fibre reinforced polyester. Static testing and {{finite element analysis}} {{have been carried out}} to obtain the characteristics of the spring. Load-deflection curves and strain measurement as a function of load for the three designs tested have been plotted for comparison with FEA predicted values. The main concern associated with the first design is the delamination failure at the interface of the fibres that have passed around the eye and the spring body, even though the design can withstand 150 kN static proof load and one million cycles fatigue load. FEA results confirmed that there is a high interlaminar shear stress concentration in that region. The second design feature is an additional transverse bandage around the region prone to delamination. Delamination was contained but not completely prevented. The third design overcomes the problem by ending the fibres {{at the end of the}} eye section...|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} kinds of steel are used <b>for</b> railway <b>rails.</b> From simple pearlitic steels for rarely used tracks over premium pearlitic steels for high performance lines to special bainitic, martensitic and austenitic steels for switches and crossings. Most of these steels have been trial and error developed over time in track. The main reasons <b>for</b> replacement of <b>rails</b> are fatigue and wear. For material selection purposes fatigue properties {{must be taken into}} account. Simple fatigue testing methods that allow comparison of different steels are scarce in literature. In this thesis results from low cycle fatigue test of four different steels are compiled and a comparison based on strain energy density is presented. The steels are all used <b>for</b> railway <b>rail</b> <b>application.</b> One is near fully pearlitic steel which is mainly employed in common track. The other three are used for different parts in switches and crossings. It is one carbide free bainitic steel, one high manganese austenitic steel and a martensitic steel. Results show the martensitic and bainitic steel as the superior steels at low strain ranges (< 0. 4 %). At high strain ranges the bainitc steel fails to perform due to crack sensitivity and the martensitic and the pearlitic steels are superior. The austenitic steel can not readily be compared to the other steels through low cycle fatigue tests because of its unique hardening property. The comparison of strain energy densities is a viable way to compare standard steels...|$|R

40|$|Modern railway {{systems are}} subject to intense use, with fast trains and large axle loads. There are many {{criteria}} which determine the suitability of a steel <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> track <b>applications.</b> The primary requirement is structural integrity, which can be compromised {{by a variety of}} fatigue mechanisms, by a lack of resistance to brittle failure, by localised plasticity and by excessive wear. All of these depend on interactions between engineering parameters, material properties and the environment. The track material must obviously be capable of being manufactured into rails with a high standard of straightness and flatness in order to avoid surface and internal defects which may cause failure. Track installation requires that the steel should be weldable and that procedures be developed to enable its maintenance and repair. Commercial success depends also on material and life–time costs. 1. Track Materials There are many kinds of loadings which can adversely affect the life of rails; amongst these, wear and plastic deformation induced by contact stresses can combine to cause unacceptable changes in the rail head profile. The system of contact stresses is dependent upon the relative motions of the wheel and rail within a small contact zone of about one square centimeter. Th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on constructing a tunable secondary suspension for high-speed trains using magneto-rheological fluid dampers (referred to as MR dampers hereafter), {{in the interest}} of improving lateral ride comfort. Two types of MR dampers (type-A and type-B) with different control ranges are designed and fabricated. The developed dampers are incorporated into a secondary suspension of a full-scale high-speed train carriage for rolling-vibration tests. The integrated rail vehicle runs at a series of speeds from 40 to 380 km/h and with different current inputs to the MR dampers. The dynamic performance of the two suspension systems and the ride comfort rating of the rail vehicle are evaluated using the accelerations measured during the tests. In this way, the effectiveness of the developed MR dampers for attenuating vibration is assessed. The type-A MR dampers function like a stiffness component, rather than an energy dissipative device, during the tests with different running speeds. While, the type-B MR dampers exhibit significant damping and high current input to the dampers may adversely affect the ride comfort. As part of an ongoing investigation on devising an effective MR secondary suspension for lateral vibration suppression, this preliminary study provides an insight into dynamic behavior of high-speed train secondary suspensions and unique full-scale experimental data for optimal design of MR dampers suitable <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>applications.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Railway {{business}} (both in Sweden and internationally) {{is in need}} of {{efficient and}} non-destructive methods for convenient measurements of the neutral temperature. Banverket has hitherto made some investigations of different such methods and this analysis aims in this perspective to · Identify different techniques and methods that are possible to use for measuring the neutral temperature and sort out those that are not useful <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications.</b> · Give the theoretical basis for each method in order to obtain a firm base for further investigations and judgements. · Perform critical examinations of the development potential, cost and time consumption for each of the methods and identifying those methods and equipments that are of most interest for further investigations. · Identify additional actions to be taken in combination with efficient neutral temperature determinations for reduction of the heat distortion risk in CWR-tracks. The following methods are possible candidates for further investigations: Ultrasonic methods Based on either the longitudinal wave principle or the birefringence principle with methods developed by, for example, NIST and RIPL. Deformation methods Based on measurements of either strains or of positions with commercial methods as the Pfender device, the MS- 02 device, the MP method or the geodesic method. Magnetic methods The Barkhausen noise principle seems to be more promising than the magnetic parameter method with developed testing methods by Railscan, Railtest and Rollscan. X-ray diffraction method Based on diffraction of X-rays in crystal planes, portable equipment exists although the method has traditionally been used under laboratory conditions. Rail vibration techniques method Based on the relation between stiffness and force in combination with an accurate laser measurement system, this method is a promising alternative. In parallel to improved measurement techniques for neutral temperature, a list of possible additional actions has been identified. These are additional logical ways to reduce the risk <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> heat distortions and they do not have any technical solutions today. The author is currently not aware of all possible efforts that have been made regarding these issues but they should be kept in mind during future work. For example: · Could rail cooling be performed by heat conduction to the cooler regions below the track? · Should the neutral temperature be increased (cf. chapter 3) ? · Could rail grinding improve the mechanical integrity? · Are there possible modifications of the CWR-concept itself that could reduce the thermal stress build up? · One obvious action is to improve the lateral resistance of the track region. This is the main focus of the accompanying report within this preliminary study. This preliminary study shows that there exist promising methods that would improve the measurements of neutral temperature. When this preliminary study is completed, it is therefore proposed that actions are taken for more detailed investigations of the one or two most promising methods. This should be done through field studies and laboratory studies in Sweden but also, where appropriate, through visits to places in Europe where the methods have been evaluated. It would also be of interest to study additional ways of reducing the risk <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> heat distortions...|$|R
40|$|Problem Statement: Fatigue {{life testing}} of large {{tapered roller bearing}} {{components}} <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> <b>applications</b> is often very costly and time consuming. The purpose of this project is to assist Amsted Rail Company, Inc. develop a large railroad tapered roller bearing test rig that does not require scaled down prototypes bearings. As these are tapered rollers, loads can be applied from either the lateral or radial direction. L 10 bearing life test predictions for the test rig bearings should be carried out using the American Bearing Manufacturers Association standards. The test rig can be designed to test as many as 4 bearings at a time or as little as one bearing raceway (1 / 2 bearing) at a time. The overall goal of the project is to design a test rig that will provide accelerated life test results, create solid models of the test rig design for illustration purposes, and provide supporting design calculations. Rationale: With completion of this project it will allow Amstead Rail Company Inc. to test their bearing products in a quicker and more efficient manner. They {{will be able to}} obtain test data in a much quicker manner, drastically decreasing the amount of time needed to make manufacturing adjustments to current production. Secondly, it will allow Amstead Rail to excel in product development by enabling them to test prototype bearing at a never achieved pace. Approach: Our team has used the method of static analysis to solve for the loads corresponding to a rail car bearing under full and partial loads. We then designed a prototype test rig and that we saw as a best fit to our customers need. We then animated the product in 3 D using the Inventor CAD program and analyzed the rig/bearing in ANSYS computer software to ensure that it could provide/withstand the designed loads. Interim Results and Conclusions: As of 12 / 1 / 2014 our team has determined the static loads that may be seen in the rig and bearing during testing operation. We have factored in many engineering criteria and worked with our contact personnel at Amstead Rail to ensure that our prototype design will meet their desired needs. Currently, our team starting to move forward with the Inventor 3 D modeling and ANSYS load analysis of the test rig. Anticipated Results and Conclusions: The expected results of this design project are to provide a bearing test rig concept that has been proven through static analysis; with corresponding 3 D CAD drawings that will allow for a functioning prototype to be built along with a bill of materials needed to create the rig.

This may be an unnecessary burden, and it is tempting instead to try to use {{as much of the}} existing interpret infrastructure as possible, both for handling aspects of the computation that are not symbolic, and for propagating symbolic ones. This approach was used to implement Rubicon, a bounded verification system <b>for</b> Ruby on <b>Rails</b> web <b>applications,</b> in less than 1000 lines of Ruby code. Rubicon uses symbolic execution to derive verification conditions from <b>Rails</b> <b>applications</b> and an off-the-shelf solver to check them.

Screen printing was not only used to deposit the active piezoelectric material but also an inertial mass ink based on tungsten. This enables the device to be printed entirely by screen printing providing a low-cost route to manufacture. Finally, details of a simulation tool that can take real world vibrations and estimate vibration energy harvester output was presented.
