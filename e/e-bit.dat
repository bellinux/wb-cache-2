There are two bits in every second block or submultiframe, whose task is to indicate block errors in {{the far end of}} the communication. The mechanismis as follows: Both bits (called E-bits) have [...] "1" [...] as their default value. When {{the far end of the}} communication receives a 2 Mbit/s frame and detects an erroneous block, it puts a [...] "0" [...] in the <b>E-bit</b> that corresponds to the block in the frame being sent along the return path to the transmitter. This way, the near end of the communication is informed that an erroneous block has been detected, and both ends have the same information: one from the CRC-4 procedure and the other from the E bits. If we number the frames in the multiframe from 0 to 15, the <b>E-bit</b> of frame 13 refers to the submultiframe I (block I) received at the far end, and the <b>E-bit</b> of frame 15 refers to the submultiframe II (block II).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{generation}} of Bell states between distant vertices in a permanently coupled quantum spin network, interacting via invariant stratification graphs. To begin with we establish a class of upper bounds over achievable entanglement between the reference site and various vertices. We observe that the maximum of these upper bounds is 1 <b>e-bit.</b> We conclude that the reference site can generate a Bell state with a vertex if the corresponding upper bound of the vertex is 1 <b>e-bit.</b> Thus for generation of a Bell state this upper bound must be saturated. Taking this into account, we obtain the characteristic constraint of the proper graphs. We introduce a special class of antipodal invariant stratification graphs, which is called reflective, whereas the antipode vertex obeys the characteristic constraint. We also show that the antipodal association scheme graphs are reflective so Bell states can be generated between the antipodal vertices. Moreover we observe that in such graphs the proper Hamiltonian that enables creation of Bell state is the Heisenberg interaction between vertex pairs. Comment: 14 pages 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Let K be the {{diagonal}} subgroup of U(2) ^{(x) n}. We may view the one-qubit state-space H_ 1 {{as a standard}} representation of U(2) and the n-qubit state space H_n=(H_ 1) ^{(x) n} as the n-fold tensor product of standard representations. Representation theory then decomposes H_n into irreducible subrepresentations of K parametrized by combinatorial objects known as Young diagrams. We argue that n- 1 classically controlled measurement circuits, each a Fredkin-gate interferometer, {{may be used to}} form a projection operator onto a random Young diagram irrep within H_n. For H_ 2, the two irreps happen to be orthogonal and correspond to the symmetric and wedge product. The latter is spanned by ket{Psi^-}, and the standard two-qubit swap interferometer requiring a single Fredkin gate suffices in this case. In the n-qubit case, it is possible to extract many copies of ket{Psi^-}. Thus applying this process using nondestructive Fredkin interferometers allows for the creation of entangled bits (<b>e-bits)</b> using fully mixed states and von Neumann measurements.

40|$|We {{show how}} an {{arbitrary}} qubit rotation can be teleported, albeit probabilistically, using 1 <b>e-bit</b> of entanglement and one classical bit. We {{use this to}} present a scheme for implementing quantum secret sharing. The scheme operates essentially by sending a "secret" rotated qubit of information to several users, who need to cooperate in order to recover the original qubit.

40|$|Efficient quantum-state {{transfer}} is achieved in a uniformly coupled spin- 1 / 2 chain, with open boundaries, by application of local magnetic fields {{on the second}} and last-but-one spins, respectively. These effective barriers induce appearance of two eigenstates, bi-localized {{at the edges of}} the chain, which allow a high quality transfer also at relatively long distances. The same mechanism may be used to send an entire <b>e-bit</b> (e. g., an entangled qubit pair) from one to the other end of the chain...|$|E
40|$|Given a bipartite {{quantum state}} (in {{arbitrary}} dimension) and a decomposition {{of it as}} a superposition of two others, we find bounds on the entanglement of the superposition state in terms of the entanglement of the states being superposed. In the case that the two states being superposed are bi-orthogonal, the answer is simple, and, for example, the entanglement of the superposition cannot be more than one <b>e-bit</b> more than the average of the entanglement of the two states being superposed. However for more general states, the situation is very different. Comment: 4 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the spin-spin entanglement between two identical fermions generated in spin-independent scattering. The spatial {{degrees of freedom}} act as ancillas {{for the creation of}} entanglement to a degree that depends on the scattering angle, θ. The number of Slater determinants generated in the process is greater than 1, corresponding to genuine quantum correlations between the identical fermions. The maximal entanglement attainable of 1 <b>e-bit</b> is reached at θ=π/ 2. We also analyze a simple θ dependent Bell's inequality, which is violated for π/ 4 <θ≤π/ 2. This phenomenon is unrelated to the symmetrization postulate but does not appear for unequal particles...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme in which {{entanglement}} {{can be transferred}} from atoms (discrete variables) to entangled states of cavity fields (continuous variables). The cavities {{play the role of}} a kind of quantum memory for entanglement, {{in such a way that}} it is possible to retrieve it back to the atoms. In our method, two three level atoms in a lambda configuration, previously entangled, are set to interact with single mode cavity fields prepared in coherent states. During the process, one <b>e-bit</b> of entanglement may be deposited in the cavities in an efficient way. We also show that the stored entanglement may be transferred back to flying atoms...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} remote {{implementation}} of a unitary transformation on a qubit. We show the existence of non-trivial protocols (i. e., using less resources than bidirectional state teleportation) which allow the perfect remote implementation of certain continuous sets of quantum operations. We prove that, up to a local change of basis, only two subsets exist that can be implemented remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed direction n⃗ and rotations by a fixed angle around an arbitrary direction lying in a plane orthogonal to n⃗. The overall classical information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote implementation depends on {{whether it is a}} priori known to which of the two teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal protocol consumes one <b>e-bit</b> of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to Bob but only one from Bob to Alice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: I {{will show}} by the {{following}} thought experiment applied to the possible generation of a warp field by harnessing quantum effects that there exists evidence in this exercise that the Universe should display an Exponential growth rate over time we’d observe as an accelerated expansion. In 1993, Bennett et al. showed that if Alice and Bob each hold one of two particles which are entangled together, a quantum state can be transmitted from Alice to Bob completely by sending fewer classical bits than would be required without the entanglement. The aspect I have been attempting to show is that one can even reduce this set further into what is best term quantum information transfer and as such, possibly control the velocity of classical information transfer and even rewrite the classical information for any zero point state or higher. But let’s examine this a bit further here. In every q-bit there is one <b>e-bit</b> of information stored. A quantum bit (or qbit) is a two dimensional Hilbert space, with basis states | 0 > and | 1 >, The general state of qbit is: Ψ = ei[(φ) / 2]co...|$|E
40|$|The {{e-business}} {{market is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} markets in Brazil, with e-business sales accounting for BRL 14. 8 billion in 2010 and a growth of 40 % per year (+ 1000 % over the past 7 years). Sales-event clubs and collective bargaining websites are one of the most dynamic segments of the e-business market: the number of new players is increasing rapidly, with over 1200 collective bargaining websites currently operating in Brazil. In that context, growth and differentiation seem to be two key success factors for Coquelux. According to webshopper (23 rd Edition, <b>e-bit),</b> growth can be achieved by targeting middle and low-income consumers from class C, who represent 50 % of the total e-commerce sales. But Coquelux, which is specialized in desire and luxury brands, has built its reputation and competitive advantage through its “exclusivity”, by targeting wealthier consumers from classes A and B who are attracted by its fashionable and high-end positioning. The evolution (growth?) of this market and the development of its competition naturally raise a strategic question for Coquelux’s managers: can Coquelux grow and still maintain its competitive advantage? Should it grow by expanding its consumer base to class C? If so, how? Consumers from classes A, B or C must be targeted through the same online communication channels. Recent studies from the ABEP/ABIPEME emphasized the importance of social networks as a tool for converting new clients and gaining their loyalty, regardless of their social class. However, high-income and low-income e-consumers do not have the same consumption habits, do not respond to the same type of marketing strategies, and most importantly, do not share the same values. Thus, it seems difficult to expand Coquelux’s consumer base to class C without changing its marketing strategies and altering its image Three options were identified for Coquelux: reinforcing its leadership on the luxury segment and focusing on a small niche market (1), which would threaten its survival in the long run; completely changing its strategy and competing for a mass market through commercial brands (2), which requires major financial investments that managers don’t have access to; or finding an intermediary solution (3). This thesis’ recommendation for the third option consists in focusing on premium brands (rather than luxury) in order to increase sales volume (Coquelux’s most profitable sales happened with local desire brands) with products that appeal to class B but also attract the emerging class C which is looking for brand recognition. It could thus implement a slow entry strategy towards the mass market without damaging its main competitive advantage...|$|E
