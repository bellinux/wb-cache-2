5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, {{a symbol of the}} beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays {{a significant role in the}} action of the poem: as the lover <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).|$|E

25|$|In 1987 Morrison {{published}} {{her most}} celebrated novel, Beloved. It {{was inspired by}} the true story of an enslaved African-American woman, Margaret Garner, a piece of history that Morrison had discovered when compiling The Black Book. Garner had escaped slavery but was pursued by slave hunters. Facing a return to slavery, Garner killed her two-year-old daughter but was captured before she could kill herself. Morrison's novel <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> dead baby returning as a ghost, Beloved, to haunt her mother and family.|$|E
25|$|In his miserable room, Dionis is {{studying}} an almanac of astrology, and listening, {{through the open}} window, to a girl singing; charmed by the sound, he sees (or <b>imagines)</b> <b>the</b> girl as a modern-day Ophelia. In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, {{under the rule of}} Prince Alexander the Good. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near Iași, dressed in Orthodox monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac. He is Friar Dan, who he has only dreamed of being Dionis, and the book is a present from his teacher, Ruben.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a core network of brain regions, including the hippocampus, supports both past remembering and future <b>imagining.</b> We investigated <b>the</b> importance of the hippocampus for these functions. Five patients with bilateral hippocampal damage and one patient with large medial temporal lobe lesions were tested {{for their ability to}} recount autobiographical episodes from the remote past, the recent past, and to imagine plausible episodes in the near future. The patients with hippocampal damage had intact remote autobiographical memory, modestly impaired recent memory, and an intact ability to <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> future. The patient with large medial temporal lobe lesions had intact remote memory, markedly impaired recent memory, and also had an intact ability to <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> future. The findings suggest that <b>the</b> capacity for <b>imagining</b> <b>the</b> future, like the capacity for remembering the remote past, is independent of the hippocampus...|$|R
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E

500|$|As he {{approaches}} adolescence and {{becomes aware of}} his sexuality, he begins to see common objects as phalluses—phalluses that project unholy rays. [...] These objects include his fingers, his toes, and his own penis, and he obsessively tries to deflect their [...] "pecker rays" [...] from reaching holy items such as churches or statues of Mary. [...] Binky finds his anguish all-consuming as he <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> destruction he cannot avoid, and spends hours praying to God for forgiveness. [...] As an adult, Binky confronts his faith and by smashing a set of statues of the Virgin Mary declares himself free of the Church and its influence on him.|$|E

500|$|The {{story begins}} as a boy named Marco walks home from school, {{thinking}} of his father's advice: [...] "Marco, keep your eyelids up/ And {{see what you can}} see." [...] However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.|$|E
500|$|The {{nightingale}} described {{within the}} poem experiences {{a type of}} death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats <b>imagines</b> <b>the</b> loss {{of the physical world}} and sees himself deadas a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing nightingales all over the heath.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) enlists Puck to {{help her}} with her first glee club solo.

Later, Sue suggests that the club perform the anthem [...] "Sing" [...] by My Chemical Romance, as they must present an anthem at the forthcoming Regionals competition. They rehearse the song, and it is well received {{by most of the}} members, who disregard Rachel's suggestion that they should instead compose an original anthem. Her week with New Directions over, Sue reveals that she has become the vocal coach for one of the glee club's Regionals competitors, Aural Intensity.|$|E
