At the turn of the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry was at the forefront of Spain's emergence as a world leader in quality wine production, being the first Spanish wine region to adopt the use of stainless steel <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks.</b> The area is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses.|$|E
25|$|The Charmat method {{takes place}} in {{stainless}} steel <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> that are pressurized.

The wine is then cooled, clarified and bottled using a counter pressure filler. The process of carbon injection (or carbonation), the method used to make soda pop fizzy, does not involve initiating a secondary fermentation but rather injecting carbon dioxide gas directly into the wine. This method produces large bubbles that quickly dissipate and is generally only used in the cheapest sparkling wines.|$|E

25|$|The Penedès is {{the largest}} and most {{productive}} wine region of Catalonia and is considered the birthplace of Cava. The region has a long winemaking history and its proximity to Barcelona has had a strong export market. In the 19th century {{it was one of the}} first Spanish wine regions to implement a large-scale commercial wine production particularly for export to post-phylloxera France. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Penedès region led in the Spanish wine industry's technological revolution; it was the first wine region to adopt the use of temperature-controlled stainless steel <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks.</b> The region also began to increase its varieties and improve its vine stock with clonal vine selections of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Merlot, Pinot noir, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

30|$|The {{large-scale}} SSF {{was performed}} in an 80 -l stainless <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> mixture contained 8.6 – 15.9 % SMCM (depending on the pretreatment), 25 FPU/g-SMCM cellulase, and 1 % dry yeast. For this fermentation, cellulase GODO TCD-H 3 (Godo Shusei Co., Ltd, Japan) was used. SMCM (with or without pretreatment) was mixed with 18  l of deionized water in the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 30  min. After cooling to 37 °C, 2  l of the cellulase solution (114 – 209  g/l depending {{on the amount of}} SMCM) and 20  g of dry yeast (Nisshin Super Camellia dry yeast; Nisshin Foods Inc., Japan) were added to the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 72  h with stirring at 150  rpm. Fermented samples were removed after 24, 48, and 72  h. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 12, 000 ×g for 15  min and stored at − 80 °C until ethanol analysis. Ethanol yield was calculated {{on the basis of the}} amount of cellulose in SMCM without any pretreatment.|$|R
25|$|The wort is {{then placed}} in a tank to undergo fermentation. These <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> can be of several types: oak, cement coated with epoxy, {{stainless}} or enamelled steel, or epoxy resin. For large volume tanks the control of temperature, which typically is around 18°C, becomes necessary. The majority of aromatic components (acetates of alcohol and ethyl esters of fatty acids) are synthesized by the yeast during fermentation of light juice below 18°C. However, clarity and low temperatures are factors which slow fermentation. Recourse to the addition of selected yeasts for these difficult working conditions becomes crucial. In contrast some producers grow their vines organically or biodynamically: the lees are of good quality without synthetic chemicals harmful to yeast so they are kept in the wine. Turbidity of the must ensures a good supply of yeasts and fermentation in small tanks or in barrels then does not require mastery of cold.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> radically changed the wine industry in warm climate regions like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of barrel fermenting whites as {{a throwback to the}} traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak has a long tradition in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they hit the market. A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|E

Historically Chablis was aged in old wooden feuillette barrels that were essentially neutral: they did not impart the characteristic oak flavors (vanilla, cinnamon, toast, coconut, etc.) that are today associated with ageing a wine in barrels.

2500|$|In {{the most}} notable {{expression}} of Nebbiolo, the wines of Barolo, there is division between what is considered a [...] "traditional" [...] approach to Nebbiolo and a [...] "modernist" [...] approach. The roots of both styles can trace their history to the early [...] "pre-technology" [...] production of Nebbiolo. Prior to the advent of temperature-controlled fermentation, the late harvest dates for Nebbiolo meant that the wines began fermentation when the weather turned cold. These cool temperatures would delay fermentation for several days, extending the maceration period and extraction of phenolic compounds such as tannins. When fermentation did begin, temperatures would reach excessive levels of 95-100 °F (35-38 °C), which would drastically reduce potential aromas and flavors. With {{the high levels of}} tannins, these early Barolos would require five years or more of aging in oak barrels to soften some of the astringency. Lack of understanding of proper hygiene lead to less sanitary conditions than what both traditional and modernist producers maintain today. Those conditions lead to the development of bacterial infection of cement <b>fermentation</b> <b>tanks</b> and old wood barrels, which contributed to the development of off flavors and potential wine faults that would require at least 24 hours decanting to alleviate.|$|E
