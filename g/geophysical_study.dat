50|$|The first <b>geophysical</b> <b>study</b> of the Kamil Crater was {{conducted}} during an Italian-Egyptian expedition undertaken in February 2010 {{as part of}} the 2009 Egyptian-Italian Science Year (EISY) and proved the meteoritic origin of the crater. It is estimated to be less than 5,000 years old and shows a well-preserved rayed structure. The crater was produced by an iron meteorite that has been given an official name after the closest topographic feature in the area, Gebel Kamil, and which fragmented into thousands of pieces upon impact with the sandstone bedrock. The meteor is estimated to have been 1.3 m wide and to have weighed 5000 to 10000 kg. Meteor fragments totalling 800 kg were recovered during the geophysical expedition, the bulk of which are curated at the Egyptian Geological Museum in Cairo. Type specimens also are curated at the Museo Nazionale dell'Antartide at the University of Siena, and at the Museo di Storia Naturale at the University of Pisa.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, {{documentation}} of gravels {{characteristic of the}} Gunnison River and located at the western mouth of Unaweep Canyon provide evidence for occupation of the canyon by an ancestral Gunnison River [...] Hence, the ancestral Gunnison River may have carved the canyon. However, another hypothesis holds that the ancestral Gunnison River did not carve the canyon, but exhumed a pre-existing (paleo) canyon. This hypothesis of an ancient age for the inner gorge of Unaweep Canyon comes from dating of sediments recovered in a core through the canyon fill. This core proved {{the existence of a}} thick (>300 m) sediment fill in the canyon, an idea first proposed in the 1970s {{on the basis of a}} <b>geophysical</b> <b>study.</b> Related to the proposed ancient age for the canyon is the hypothesis that the canyon was glaciated during the Late Paleozoic, roughly 300 million years ago.

30|$|The <b>geophysical</b> <b>study</b> of Abe et al.

These results suggest that a magma reservoir exists at depths of 8 – 15  km, which is consistent with our amphibole barometry results (Fig.  6).

40|$|A {{programme}} of geochemical and <b>geophysical</b> <b>study</b> {{was started}} in 1971 to assess the mineral potential of the Exmoor area. Drainage geochemistry over both Exmoor and the Brendon Hills indicated areas of anomalous metal concentrations in stream sediments which call for further investigation. Some of these anomalies undoubtedly relate to vein style mineralisation, but others probably reflect a stratiform distribution of ore metals. Barium anomalies have also been recognised and these are presumed to indicate previously unrecorded veins of barite. Investigation of an aeromagnetic anomaly which trends WNW - ESE over the upland areas resolves it into shallow and deep components. The source of the more deepseated magnetic anomaly remains uncertain but two diamond drill holes showed the shallow source to be pyrrhotite mineralisation {{in the form of}} disseminations and veinlets. Detailed soil geochemistry was carried out over some of the aeromagnetic anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract.
