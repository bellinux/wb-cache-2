The absence of any consequential readings at any of the tested locations as compared to the control sample reading 1050 mg/kg supports the evidence that these facilities were not execution gas chambers. The small quantities detected would indicate that at some point these buildings were deloused with Zyklon B - as were all the buildings at all these facilities.|$|E

5000|$|Cannabis is {{detectable}} by saliva testing. Just {{like blood}} testing, saliva testing detects {{the presence of}} parent drugs and not their inactive metabolites. This results in a shorter window of detection for cannabis by saliva testing. Delta 9 THC is the parent compound. If a saliva sample is tested in a lab, the <b>detection</b> <b>level</b> can be as low as 0.5 ng/mL (up to 72 hours after intake) [...] and if an onsite instant saliva drug test is used, the cut off level is generally 50 ng/mL (up to 12 hours after intake).

5000|$|Protein {{dipstick}} measurements {{should not}} be confused with the amount of protein detected on a test for microalbuminuria which denotes values for protein for urine in mg/day versus urine protein dipstick values which denote values for protein in mg/dL. That is, there is a basal level of proteinuria that can occur below 30 mg/day which is considered non-pathology. Values between 30-300 mg/day are termed microalbuminuria which is considered pathologic. Urine protein lab values for microalbumin of >30 mg/day correspond to a <b>detection</b> <b>level</b> within the [...] "trace" [...] to [...] "1+" [...] range of a urine dipstick protein assay. Therefore, positive indication of any protein detected on a urine dipstick assay obviates any need to perform a urine microalbumin test as the upper limit for microalbuminuria has already been exceeded.|$|E
50|$|Although {{particles}} and TOC are usually measured using on-line methods, {{there is significant}} value in complimentary or alternative off-line lab analysis. The value of the lab analysis has two aspects: cost and speciation. Smaller UPW facilities that cannot afford to purchase on-line instrumentation often choose off-line testing. TOC {{can be measured in}} the grab sample at a concentration as low as 5 ppb, using the same technique employed for the on-line analysis (see on-line method description). This <b>detection</b> <b>level</b> covers the majority of needs of less critical electronic and all pharmaceutical applications. When speciation of the organics is required for troubleshooting or design purposes, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) provides an effective analysis. This method allows for identification of biopolymers, humics, low molecular weight acids and neutrals, and more, while characterizing nearly 100% of the organic composition in UPW with sub-ppb level of TOC.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The UK {{police service}} {{has a major}} {{challenge}} to introduce innovative ways of improving efficiency and productivity, whilst {{at the same time}} improving public opinion as to their effectiveness in the “fight against crime”. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline an exploratory study of the ability to cluster police forces based on their sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels</b> over a number of different offence groups and whether these clusters have different associated public opinions towards them. Design/methodology/approach – Using secondary data and the fuzzy c-means clustering technique to exposit clusters of police forces based on sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels,</b> relating them in a statistical analysis with public opinion on the police. Findings – The clustering analysis shows how police forces can be considered relative to each other, based on their sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels</b> of certain offence groups, including; burglary, fraud and forgery and criminal damage. Using the established clusters of police forces, in respect of independent variables relating to public opinion, including confidence in police; there does appear to be statistically significant differences amongst the clusters of police force. Research limitations/implications – The results demonstrate the connection between the police's attempt to fight crime and public opinion. With the public opinion measures considered post the establishing of police forces’ clusters, the results show the public does notice the <b>level</b> of sanction <b>detections</b> achieved. The identified disconnect of the public with the criminal justice system is something that can be improved on in the future. Practical implications – Demonstrates that there is a significant link in the relationship between the <b>levels</b> of sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels</b> of police forces and public opinion about their ability to fight crime. Originality/value – This paper employs fuzzy c-means, a modern clustering technique nascent in this area of research...|$|R
40|$|The Beckman Helium Discharge Detector {{has been}} found to be {{sensitive}} to the fixed gases oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen at <b>detection</b> <b>levels</b> 10 - 100 times more sensitive than possible with a Bow-Mac Thermal Conductivity Detector. <b>Detection</b> <b>levels</b> o~ approximately 1. 9 E- 4 ~ v/v oxygen, 3. 1 E- 4 ~ v/v nitrogen, and 3. 0 E- 3 ~ v/v hydrogen are estimated.

5000|$|In humans, psychophysical {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} constant BGN have also implicated the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) in selective listening. The research perhaps most {{relevant to this}} thesis has been performed by Scharf and his colleagues. In 1993, Scharf et al. presented data from eight patients who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy to treat Ménière’s disease, a procedure which severs the OCB (presumably both the MOCS and the LOCS). Scharf et al. (1993) {{did not find any}} clear differences in subjects’ thresholds to tones in noise before and after surgery. Shortly after this finding, Scharf et al. (1994, 1997) performed a comprehensive set of psychophysical experiments from a total of sixteen patients who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy (including the original eight subjects). [...] They measured performance in the psychophysical listening tasks before and after surgery, and found no significant difference in performance for (i) detection of tones, (ii) intensity discrimination of tones, (iii) frequency discrimination of tones, (iv) loudness adaptation, and (v) detection of tones in notched-noise. Their only positive finding was that most patients detected unexpected sounds in the operated ear better than in the healthy ear, or the same ear before surgery. This result was obtained using a truncated probe-signal procedure which led the patient to expect a certain frequency on each trial. Twelve subjects completed this experiment. Their procedure was similar to that of Greenberg and Larkin (1968), except only 50% of trials (not 77%) contained a target whose frequency matched that of the auditory cue. The other 50% of trials containing a probe whose frequency differed from that of the cue. Also, only two probe frequencies were used, one whose frequency was higher than the target, and one whose frequency was lower than the target. All trials contained an auditory cue (at the target frequency) prior to the first observation interval. The results were used to construct a basic attentional filter, which displayed <b>detection</b> <b>level</b> of the expected (and cued) target frequency and the two unexpected probe frequencies. From the two published reports (Scharf et al., 1994, 1997), ears for which the OCB has been lesioned showed an attentional filter with an average depth of about 15%-correct less than those ears for which the OCB was intact. Although {{there is no way to}} empirically convert this value to dB, a rough estimate based on psychometric functions presented by Green and Swets (1966) yields a value of 2-3 dB. Their results have been summarised in the inset figure.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{paper is}} set {{in the context of the}} impact of new public {{management}} (NPM) on the police service in the UK. Specifically, it aims to describe a modelling based approach to targeted police performance improvement within a specific area of measured operational policing namely sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels.</b> It draws upon nationally available crime statistics, which have been utilised in a novel way in order to provide the police with an additional performance management technique. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses secondary data and the PROMETHEE ranking technique to exposit performance rank improvement of a police force amongst their most similar forces group. Findings – The modelling approach is a proven tool that could be used in partnership with other police performance management techniques in their attempt to meet the public interest and Home Office demands for improvements in base sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels.</b> Research limitations/implications – The paper presents a theoretical approach that seeks to address a complex and multifaceted operational issue affecting all police forces. The theoretical nature in itself presents a potentially idealistic scenario. Practical implications – The paper demonstrates that innovative modelling has the potential to add value to techniques that are currently used in the area of police performance improvement, in this case sanction <b>detection</b> <b>levels.</b> At the fundamental level this could be viewed in terms of “Where to start first, and from there?” with respect to targeting certain types of crime.

40|$|The Monte Carlo program FLUKA {{was used}} to {{calculate}} the number of muons reaching <b>detection</b> <b>level</b> in events initiated by primary cosmic gamma ray interactions in the atmosphere. The calculation was motivated by the desire to gauge the sensitivity of arrays like that of Project GRAND to primary gamma cosmic rays while measuring single muons at <b>detection</b> <b>level.</b> Because direct gamma pair production is not a significant source of muons, normally the presence of muons is not considered as a signal for gamma rays. However, due to their non-negligible cross section for hadron production, high-energy gamma rays can initiate hadronic showers containing a large number of pions. These can decay producing secondary muons which then {{have a good chance of}} reaching <b>detection</b> <b>level.</b> The complete kinetic energy and space distribution of such muons can be predicted by simulating in detail the whole process by means of Monte Carlo techniques. However, the code used must be capable of handling both hadron-nucleus and photon-nucleus interactions. Unlike most available Monte Carlo particle transport programs, such interactions are implemented in FLUKA, up to several tens of TeV, based on Dual Parton and Vector Meson Dominance models. The FLUKA capability to describe hadronic cascades generated in the atmosphere by primary cosmic hadrons has already been shown in several studies. In the present paper, the investigation has been extended to primary gamma rays. The numbe...|$|E
