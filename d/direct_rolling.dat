40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{well-known}} {{fact that the}} rolling movement always has a lower friction compared to sliding friction, the authors have conceived and realized a pivoting movement joint on a “layer of balls ” with “compensation space”, placed between the acetabular cup and the femoral head. This technical solution allows free self-directed migration of the balls, depending on the resistance opposed, with successive occupation of the “compensation space”. As a concept, the proposed technical solution excludes {{the existence of a}} cage for maintaining the relative positions of the spheres. It can be observed that the smallest values of the force and of the friction coefficient are obtained for the prostheses with balls and self-directed movement (approximately 5 times smaller than the values obtained for a classical prosthesis). For all the couples tested, the friction force grows with the growth of the normal load and of the oscillation speed. Changing the contact mechanism for the artificial hip joint from one sliding contact between two large surfaces, to a multitude of rolling contacts, could lead to some problems regarding functionality and durability of the active prosthesis elements.

Vanadium microalloyed steels {{with high}} yield {{strength}} (≈ 600 MPa), good toughness and ductility {{have been successfully}} produced in commercial thin slab casting plants employing <b>direct</b> <b>rolling</b> after casting.

While some vanadium is precipitated in austenite as cuboids and pins the grain boundaries, a major fraction is available for dispersion strengthening of ferrite. Despite a coarse as-cast grain size, significant grain refinement can be achieved by repeated recrystallisation during hot rolling. Consequently, a fine and uniform ferrite grain structure is produced in the final strip. Increasing the V and N levels increases dispersion strengthening which occurs together with a finer ferrite grain size. The addition of titanium to a vanadium containing steel, decreases the yield strength due to the formation of V-Ti(N) particles in austenite during both casting and equalisation.

40|$|Abstract. Thin slab <b>direct</b> <b>rolling</b> (TSDR) {{technology}} has some important metallurgical differences compared to conventional routes. One {{of these differences}} deals with the combination of coarse as-cast austenite grains {{and the possibility of}} limited solubility of microalloyed addition at the entry of the rolling mill. The industrial tendency of increasing the strength and toughness of steel grades produced by TSDR route requires increased amounts of Nb addition to achieve a proper austenite conditioning prior to transformation. Nevertheless, an increase in the Nb content rises the risk of premature Nb(C,N) precipitation during early rolling stages. In order to avoid this, one possibility is to add Mo and limit the amount of Nb. This study analyzes the influence of different Mo contents on static recrystallization of Nb microalloyed steels. The analysis includes the evaluation of the incidence of the combined effect of Nb and Mo solute drag retardation in both heterogeneous recrystallization evolution and grain size distribution for the case of initial coarse austenite grain sizes. To do that, partially recrystallized microstructures have been analyzed and microstructural parameters of interest quantified...|$|E

A coupled thermo-mechanical model including inverse analysis technique was adopted for the solver. The advantage of the solution was the analytical form of both incompressibility and mass conservation conditions. This can prevent usual FEM variational solution problems concerning unintentional specimen volume loss caused by the numerical errors. It is very important for the discussed modeling because the deformation process is running in temperature range that is characteristic for the last stage of transformation of steel aggregation state. The well known machine allowing tests in the discussed temperature range is the Gleeble ® 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. However, carrying out experiments with steel deformation in semi-solid state using this machine are very expensive. Therefore application of a dedicated computer simulation system is strictly required. Inverse analysis and appropriate modeling of the testing procedure makes tests possible, first of all, but it also results in lowering testing cost.
