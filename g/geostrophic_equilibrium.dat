50|$|Equatorial Rossby waves {{can also}} adjust to {{equilibrium}} under gravity in the tropics; because the planetary waves have frequencies {{much lower than}} gravity waves. The adjustment process tends {{to take place in}} two distinct stages where the first stage is a rapid change due to the fast propagation of gravity waves, the same as that on an f-plane (Coriolis parameter held constant), resulting in a flow that is close to <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> This stage could be thought of as the mass field adjusting to the wave field (due to the wavelengths being smaller than the Rossby deformation radius. The second stage is one where quasi-geostrophic adjustment takes place by means of planetary waves; this process can be comparable to the wave field adjusting to the mass field (due to the wavelengths being larger than the Rossby deformation radius.|$|E

L function possesses unique parameter θM, Comparing with other famous probability distribution L distribution function has similarly certain properties such as, (1) variance is (θM/ 3) 2; standard variance is θM/ 3, mathematical expectation equal to zero, (2) fourth moment (θM) 4 / 25, coefficient of kurtosis is 0. 24, which more 0. 24 {{than that of}} Normal distribution function.

A further study of temperatures and zonal winds is conducted for Canton Island, Ascension Island, and Balboa, C. Z. Statistics are derived for the period of record prior to 1962 and for that subsequent to 1962.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} {{colocated}} Godunov type finite volume schemes {{applied to the}} two-dimensional linear wave equation with Coriolis source term. The purpose is to explain the wrong behaviour of the classical scheme and to modify {{it in order to}} avoid accuracy issues around the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and in geostrophic adjustment processes. To do so, a Hodge-like decomposition is introduced. Then three different well-balanced strategies are introduced. Some properties of the associated modified equation are proven and then extended to the semi-discrete case. Stability of fully discrete schemes under a classical CFL condition is established thanks to a Von Neumann analysis. Some numerical results reinforce the purpose...|$|E
40|$|In large lakes, {{during the}} heating season, the {{combination}} of surface wind drift and solar heating results in the horizontal transport {{of some of the}} absorbed heat into the coastal zone. Large-scale vertical movements associated with alternating upwellings and downwellings distribute the heat over a deeper water mass than at mid-lake. As a result, the mean shape of isotherm surfaces is “domed” and, correspondingly, the lake surface is slightly raised near shore and depressed over the center thermocline dome. The mean circulation in <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with this surface elevation field is a cyclonic gyre. In Lake Ontario, the amplitude of the mean surface velocity associated with this gyre is of the order of 3 cm sec- 1...|$|E
40|$|A quasi-steady {{state model}} of the {{consequences}} of rotation on the hydrodynamical structure of a stellar radiative zone is derived, by studying in particular the role of centrifugal and baroclinic driving of meridional motions in angular-momentum transport. This nonlinear problem is solved numerically assuming axisymmetry of the system, and within some limits, it is shown that there exist simple analytical solutions. The limit of slow rotation recovers Eddington-Sweet theory, whereas it is shown that in the limit of rapid rotation, the system settles into a <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The behaviour of the system is found to be controlled by one parameter only, linked to the Prantl number, the stratification and the rotation rate of the star.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{filtering}} inertia-gravity waves from elevation and depth-averaged velocity is described. This filtering scheme {{is derived from}} the linear shallow water equations for constant depth and constant Coriolis frequency. The filtered solution is obtained by retaining only the eigenvectors corresponding to the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and by discarding explicitly the eigenvectors corresponding to the fast moving inertia-gravity waves. An alternative formulation is derived using a variational approach. Both filtering methods are tested numerically for a periodic domain with constant depth and the variational approach is implemented for a closed domain with large topographic variations. The filtering methods significantly reduce the amplitudes of the inertia-gravity waves while preserving the mean flow. The variational method is compared to the Incremental Analysis Update technique and the benefits of the variational filter are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{shallow water}} {{equations}} are introduced and discretized {{in a standard}} C-grid with a leapfrog, FCTS numerical scheme combined with simple Asselin-Roberts filtering as presented in Kantha and Clayson [5]. Plain Dirichelet conditions were implemented at the boundaries. Sim-ple testing were performed with a gaussian level elevation and with wind forcing. The <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of a gaussian level elevation is presented and an analytical solution of the steady-state is obtained.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} to derive surface geostrophic current from a newly released altimetric sea-level data set. TOPEX/Poseidon data were first completely reprocessed from Geophysical Data Records using new algorithms accommodating marginal seas and coastal conditions. The methodology {{applied to the}} reprocessed data essentially consists of a smoothing of the raw along-track coastal altimetric data at scales at which the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> holds. This {{was reduced to a}} computational procedure using a set of objective criteria. We have applied the method to the East India Coastal Current (EICC) at the western boundary of the Bay of Bengal. This paper first examines the quality of the new data set, which compares well with tide-gauge data; the current we derived is consistent with independent estimates. Our methodology reveals the full spectrum of the along-shore current, ranging from intra-seasonal to inter-annual time scales, from the deep ocean to the shelf-break area where the EICC exists. The algorithm can be applied to any coastal region where an order of the Rossby radius can be defined, and it therefore opens up bright prospects for mapping the variability of other boundary-current systems in the world ocean from altimetry...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamical}} coupled ice-ocean {{numerical model}} for the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is suggested and used to study upwelling dynamics in the MIZ. The nonlinear sea ice model has a variable ice concentration and includes internal ice stress. The model is forced by stresses on the air/ocean and air/ice surfaces. The main coupling between the ice and the ocean {{is in the form}} of an interfacial stress on the ice/ocean interface. The ocean model is a linear reduced gravity model. The wind stress exerted by the atmosphere on the ocean is proportional to the fraction of open water, while the interfacial stress ice/ocean is proportional to the concentration of ice. A new mechanism for ice edge upwelling is suggested based on a <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> solution for the sea ice medium. The upwelling reported in previous models invoking a stationary ice cover is shown to be replaced by a weak downwelling due to the ice motion. Most of the upwelling dynamics can be understood by analysis of the divergence of the across ice edge upper ocean transport. On the basis of numerical model, an analytical model is suggested that reproduces most of the upwelling dynamics of the more complex numerical model...|$|E
40|$|A {{perturbation}} {{potential vorticity}} (PV) theory is developed {{to investigate the}} three-dimensional, time-depen-dent, linear geostrophic adjustment of a stably stratified, Boussinesq atmosphere that is disturbed from (i) quiescent equilibrium due to a localized, unbalanced, zonal wind anomaly and (ii) <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of the uniform zonal flow due to an isolated couplet of acceleration–deceleration forcing. This prescribed zonal momentum forcing propagates downstream at a speed c that {{is less than the}} basic-state zonal flow speed U and physically represents the parameterized effects of nonlinear inertial advection. Transient, dispersive inertia–gravity waves in all fields are essentially removed during the early stage of the response associated with the initial value problem. The steady-state equilibrium that conserves the initial per-turbation PV is a localized, geostrophic zonal jet with meridionally confluent (diffluent) flow in its entrance (exit) region. This jet is supported by a couplet of perturbation low and high pressure north and south of the zonal jet core, respectively. There exist no steady-state ageostrophic winds and vertical motions once balanced equilibrium is reached. This long-term asymptotic response characterizes a localized linear thermal wind balance among the baroclinic perturbations that will not be preserved in the nonlinear initial value problem. The forced response for a uniform, stably stratified, zonal flow whose Rossby number is RoU 5 (U 2 c) / 2 a...|$|E
40|$|A planar {{problem of}} {{nonlinear}} transverse oscillations {{of the surface}} (warm) front of a finite width is considered {{within the framework of}} a reduced-gravity model of the ocean. The source of oscillations is the departure of the front from its <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> When the current velocity is linear in the horizontal coordinate and the front's depth is quadratic in this coordinate, the problem is reduced to a system of four ordinary differential equations in time. As a result, the solution is obtained in a weakly nonlinear approximation and strongly nonlinear oscillations of the front are studied by numerically solving this system of equations by the Runge-Kutta method. The front's oscillations are always superinertial. Nonlinearity can lead to a decrease or increase in the oscillation frequency in comparison with the linear case. The oscillations are most intense when the current velocity is disturbed {{in the direction of the}} front's axis. A weakly nonlinear solution of the second order describes the oscillations very accurately even for initial velocity disturbances reaching 50 % of its geostrophic value. An increase in the background-current shear leads to the damping of oscillations of the front's boundary. The amplitude of oscillations of the current velocity increases as the intensity of disturbances increases, and it is relatively small if background-current shears are small or large...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{analyzed}} the thermohaline, light transmission and particulate matter data, obtained in the western sector of the Ross Sea during the X Italian Expedition, {{for the purpose of}} investigating the evolution of the High Salinity Shelf Water in this area. In particular CTD data were used to estimate the baroclinic velocity field. Light transmission and total particulate matter data (from Niskin bottles mounted on a Carousel water sampler) were used to analyze the nepheloid layers and the evolution of the suspended sediments. This basin is characterized by a northward flow of very dense High Salinity Shelf Water (Ø = 1. 95 °C, S = 34. 90), much colder than the incoming Circumpolar Deep Water (Ø = 1. 20 °C, S = 34. 70). We obtained a scenario in which the High Salinity Shelf Water interacts with the Circumpolar Deep Water along the Antarctic Slope Front, and deviates from its <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Interestingly, this cold dense water mixes with Circumpolar Deep Water at the shelf break and flows downward until it seems to disappear. Below this cold flow, a thin turbulent current has been observed, again moving northward with a high velocity 0. 2 – 1. 0 m s/ 1. This thin flow also contains high concentration of suspended matter produced by the interaction of the dense water and the bottom sediments. The various elementary mechanisms ruling the dynamics of such down-flows, namely the effects of topographic irregularities, bottom friction, Ekman benthic boundary layers or the effect of the variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which can push offshore the dense water, are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The Gulf of Aigues-Mortes (NW Mediterranean Sea) is a midshelf zone whose {{scale is}} an {{intermediate}} between the nearshore scale (0 – 10 m depth) and the coastal scale (including the whole continental shelf). Its hydrodynamics is investigated {{for the first}} time. ADCP, CTD and thermosalinograph data were collected during three short cruises (HYGAM; March 6 – 7, 20 – 21, April 5 – 6, 2005). They were scheduled approximately every 15 days to sample the gulf circulation under different weather conditions. Moreover, the cruise data were used to validate the Symphonie model, a 3 D primitive equations circulation model. The circulation features displayed by in situ data were well reproduced by Symphonie. A downscaling modelling approach was implemented, the largest scale being obtained by the replay of the MFSTEP regional model of the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. The analysis, closely coupling in situ measurements and model results, provides information {{that would not have}} been obtained using data separately. The great variability of the oceanic circulation at this scale is well evidenced. Winds are the main forces, not only locally but also at a larger scale. North winds generate coherent structures interacting with the general Mediterranean circulation. The explanation of the induced currents is then not straightforward, some of them being, for example, northward. South and southeast winds reinforce the sloping surface, the latter allowing the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with longshore currents. This study, focused on the end of winter 2004 – 2005, also enhances the heat fluxes from offshore to nearshore, as well as the initiation of shelf dense waters. The knowledge of the midshelf oceanic circulation is then applied to run a numerical experiment which describes both the dispersion of a fictive contaminant from a point S (at the centre of the GAM), and evaluates the risk of contamination of the beaches along the GAM shores...|$|E
40|$|Mesoscale model {{simulations}} {{provide insight}} into the complex jet streak adjustments on 11 - 12 July 1981 that preceded the first of two significant gravity wave events to have been generated over the Rocky Mountains in Montana. Simulations employing a variety of terrain treatments indicate that prior to wave formation, geostrophic adjustment processes modified the structure of the mid-upper tropospheric jet streak by creating secondary jetlets to the southeast of the polar jet streak in proximity to the gravity wave generation region. This simulated restructuring of the mid-upper tropospheric jet streak {{is the result of a}} four stage process. During stage 1, the wind adjusts to the mass field as the jet streak exit region propagates into the inflection point between the upstream trough and downstream ridge in the height field. Stage 2 is initiated as the mass field is forced to adjust to the new ageostrophic wind field created during stage 1. Stage 3 is defined by a second geostrophic adjustment process occurring in a similar manner but to the south and east of the adjustment which occurs during stage 1. A low-level mesoscale jetlet is formed during stage 4 in response to the low-level pressure falls that are established during stage 3. The perturbation of this jetlet, caused by orographically-induced adiabatic and diabatic physical processes, is the likely mechanism responsible for the generation of the first and second episode of observed gravity waves. The dynamics responsible for this wave episode are discussed as differential surface sensible heating inducing an orographically-forced mountain-plains solenoid, resulting in the formation of additional mesoscale jetlets and internal gravity waves. Also discussed is how convective latent heating modifies the numerically simulated terrain-induced internal gravity waves, especially their amplitude and phase velocities, which provide better agreement with those wave characteristics observed in nature. Finally, the three-dimensional linear response of a zonally uniform barotropic flow in a vertically unbounded, continuously stratified, Boussinesq atmosphere which is perturbed from <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Synoptic {{development}} is studied using a two-and-one-half-layer contour dynamics model in full spherical geometry. The model has three isentropic layers: two lower layers that are dynamically active and one upper layer that is kept motionless. The isentropic layers cover the whole sphere and are confined in the vertical direction by two rigid horizontal boundaries. The model {{is assumed to}} be in hydrostatic and geostrophic equilibrium; forcing/friction and diabatic heating/cooling are neglected. In both active layers, the horizontal structure is represented by a piecewise-uniform distribution of potential vorticity with a single front in each layer. The potential vorticity front in the upper active layer can be associated with the tropopause or, to be more specific, with the sudden change in height of the tropopause at the jet stream. The potential vorticity front in the lower active layer enhances the baroclinicity of the system and may be associated with the polar front. Because of the assumption of hydrostatic and <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> the model atmosphere is completely defined by the instantaneous positions of the contours and can be integrated in time using the technique of contour dynamics. It is shown that realistic zonal flows can be obtained by a suitable choice of parameters. A linear stability analysis reveals that small-amplitude perturbations of given planetary wavenumber may grow for only specific latitudinal positions of the potential vorticity fronts. The maximum growth rates and highest planetary wavenumbers are found for potential vorticity fronts that are located at approximately the same latitude. Because of the conceptual simplicity of the model, in which the potential vorticity structure is represented by only two contours, the instability mechanism expresses itself in a clear way. The contour dynamics model also captures the nonlinear stages of cyclogenesis remarkably well, as is evident from the time evolution of the fronts and the time evolution of a passive tracer in a numerical simulation of a cutoff cyclone...|$|E
40|$|A three fold nested {{model is}} built, {{covering}} (a) the Mediterranean Sea (resolution 1 / 4 degree) (b) its North-Western part (resolution 1 / 20 degree), and (c) the Gulf of Lions (resolution 1 / 100 degree). The GHER hydrodynamic model (see e. g. [1]) {{is used for}} a simulation of the springs of 1997 and 1998. As the model allows mode splitting, the timestep in each grid is 3 seconds for the barotropic modes, and 3 minutes for the baroclinic modes. ECMWF atmospheric forcings and MODB 4 /MEDAR climatic data are used. This simulation is run with one-directionnal and bi-directionnal nesting (i. e. without and with statevector feedback), and results are compared. The output of the 1997 and 1998 simulations (3 D temperature and salinity fields, and sea surface elevation field) are then used to build 3 D multivariate EOFs over the 3 grids alltogether. This guarantees perfect correlations between points from different grids, that are physically at the same location. The following twin experiment is then set up. The simulation from 1998 serves as a control run. A delayed state of this run, serves as initial conditions for the perturbed run. The first 40 EOFs are used to build a reduced-rank model errorspace. Sea surface temperature and sea surface elevation from the reference run, physically located in the Gulf of Lions, are then assimilated in the perturbed run, using a reduced-rank optimal interpolation assimilation scheme. A previous experiment showed non-physical long-range corrections (far outside the Gulf of Lions); these corrections are removed by multiplying the corrections with a radial Gaussian function centered on the corresponding observations. The multivariate statevector ensures corrections are made to temperature, salinity and sea surface elevation fields. Using the corrected fields, the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{is used to calculate}} corrections to the velocity field. In this above twin experiment, observations are assimilated all at once in the 3 grids since a single statevector is used. The results are compared to classic approaches where each grid has a corresponding statevector, and observations are assimilated in a single grid (or in different grids separately). Finally, ongoing research about statistical predictors is presented. Indeed, primitive equation models are too costly to evolve the errorspace in time, even when reducedrank assimilation schemes are used. Statistical methods aim to replace the hydrodynamic model by a much faster method, that would then be used to evolve in time each of the directions of the errorspace, or alternately, the members of an ensemble method. Statistical methods need to be trained on real results; they are thus first tested on the model itself rather than on the errorspace. Preliminary results are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} gravity waves. Gravity waves occur over the small scale portion of the atmospheric wave spectrum. Gravity waves are associated with oscillations of meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind velocity, pressure, and density and they arise when air becomes stratified due to gravity. Gravity waves can propagate to high altitudes in the atmosphere and exhibit {{a broad spectrum of}} possible periods (minutes until hours) as well as horizontal wavelengths (few hundred kilometres up to approximately thousand kilometres). Gravity waves may therefore transport momentum and energy from their origin (e. g. orography in the troposphere) into other altitudes, e. g. the stratosphere und mesosphere hence influence the general circulation of the atmosphere. The characteristics of non-orographic gravity waves, which arise in mid latitudes, are to a large extent unknown. It prevails so far to ambiguity over it where such non-stationary gravity waves develop and are as large their portion. Observed rising of gravity wave activity near frontal zones and "Jetstreams" over the ocean [Fritts and Nastrom 1992] is a reference on the fact that also different non-orographic sources possess a not insignificant portion of the gravity wave activity. Through systematic evaluation of a four years data record of radiosonde data of a station in the mid latitudes (Lindenberg) a further contribution could be made here for the production of a global climatology for gravity wave activity within the SPARC gravity wave initiative: It was shown that the gravity wave activity in the mid latitudes is clearly smaller (factor 1 / 2) than in tropical areas and possesses a typical annual variation (maximum gravity wave activity in the winter and minimum activity in the summer) which dependent on the background wind, and from which the synoptic situation. The observed gravity waves propagate on the average against the usually dominant west winds. The portion of the upward propagation of the gravity wave energy (Troposphere 50 %, Stratosphere 80 %) points on a source of the gravity waves in the upper troposphere. As sources for gravity waves in the mid latitudes fronts and the "jetstream" during the adjustment of ageostrophic winds to the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> ("geostrophic adjustment") come due to the results in question. The observed waves have frequencies near the local inertial frequency, the horizontal wavelengths lie within the range of some hundred kilometres. Several case studies in this thesis showed that the occurrence of increased power densities over Lindenberg with increased wind velocities in the tropopause region collapses and a similar synoptic situation was present, as in the simulation of inertial gravity waves during the development of a baroclinic instability by O'Sullivan and Dunkerton [1995]. Thus the suggestion of gravity waves over Lindenberg appears by the adjustment of a geostrophic imbalance as dominating developing mechanism to prevail...|$|E
