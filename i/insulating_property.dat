50|$|Monolayer {{hexagonal}} {{boron nitride}} (h-BN), {{also known as}} ‘white graphene’, is structurally similar to graphite and features a honeycomb arrangement with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in place of carbon. h-BN has a higher energy gap (5.97 eV) than graphene, thus functions as an insulator instead of a semimetal. However, it can also function as a semiconductor with enhanced conductivity due to its zigzag sharp edges and vacancies. h-BN is often used as substrate and barrier due to its <b>insulating</b> <b>property.</b> Furthermore, h-BN also has a large thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. Thus, it can be employed as a support for metal catalyst due to its chemical, thermal, acid-base stability and high thermal conductance.|$|E
50|$|Oil circuit {{breakers}} rely upon vaporization {{of some of}} the oil to blast a jet of oil along the path of the arc. The vapor released by the arcing consists of hydrogen gas.Mineral oil has better <b>insulating</b> <b>property</b> than air. Whenever there is a separation of current carrying contacts in the oil, the arc in circuit breaker is initialized at the moment of separation of contacts, and due to this arc the oil is vaporized and decomposed in mostly hydrogen gas and ultimately creates a hydrogen bubble around the electric arc. This highly compressed gas bubble around the arc prevents re-striking of the arc after current reaches zero crossing of the cycle. The oil circuit breaker {{is one of the oldest}} type of {{circuit breakers}}.|$|E
50|$|Deconstructive {{metamorphosis}} {{begins as}} the snow makes {{its way to the}} ground often melting, refreezing, and settling. Water molecules become reordered causing the snowflakes to become more spherical in appearance. These melting snowflakes fuse with others around them becoming larger until all are uniform in size. While the snow is on the ground the melting and joining of snow flakes reduces the height of snowpack by shrinking air spaces and causing the density and mechanical strength of the snowpack to increase. Freshly fallen snow with a density of 0.1 g/cm3 has very good insulating properties; however as time goes on, due to destructive metamorphism the <b>insulating</b> <b>property</b> of the snowpack decreases because the air spaces between snowflakes disappear. Snow that has been residing on the ground {{for a long period of}} time has an average density of 0.40 g/cm3 and conducts heat well; however, once a base of 50 cm of snow with a density around 0.3 g/cm3 has accumulated, temperatures under the snow remain relatively constant because the greater depth of snow compensates for its density. Destructive metamorphosis is a function of time, location, and weather. It occurs at a faster rate with higher temperatures, in the presence of water, under larger temperature gradients (e.g., warm days followed by cold nights), at lower elevations and on slopes that receive large amounts of solar radiation. As time goes on snow settles compacting air spaces, a process expedited by the packing force of the wind.|$|E

40|$|The {{surfaces}} of three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) {{characterized by a}} spin-helical Dirac fermion provide a fertile ground for realizing exotic phenomena as well as having potential for wide-ranging applications. To realize most of their special properties, the Dirac point (DP) is required to be located near the Fermi energy with a bulk <b>insulating</b> <b>property</b> while it is hardly achieved {{in most of the}} discovered TIs. It has been recently found that TlBiSe 2 features an in-gap DP, where upper and lower parts of surface Dirac cone are both utilized.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} self-producing heat and {{external}} radiation on the <b>insulating</b> <b>property</b> of wire are studied experimentally in this paper. In the experiments of self-producing heat of wire, 6 types of wires are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise of wire on <b>insulating</b> <b>property</b> of wire is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance of wire decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature of wire is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance of wire. When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|E
