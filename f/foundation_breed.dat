50|$|The Quarab is a horse breed {{from the}} United States, {{developed}} from a part-Arabian cross of Arabian horses, American Quarter Horses and Paint horses. Members of the breed are found that resemble {{all three of}} the <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds,</b> leading to three recognized types: Straight or Foundation (an even cross between the Arabian and stock horse types), Stock (a heavier emphasis on stock horse breeding) and Pleasure (a heavier emphasis on Arabian breeding). Although there have been records of crosses between the three breeds throughout the history of their respective registries, the first Quarab registry was formed in 1984, but later went out of business. In 1999, the International Quarab Horse Association was formed and remains the leading force in Quarab breeding. In order to be registered with the IQHA, horses must have at least 1/8 blood from both the Arabian and stock horse types.|$|R
5000|$|The {{need for}} these {{registries}} arose because, {{in the days}} prior to DNA parentage testing, the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) would not register horses with excessive white markings, sometimes called [...] "cropouts", thinking that such markings were a sign of non-purebred breeding and was maintained for several decades because it was also feared that excess white increased the risk of horses producing a foal with lethal white syndrome (LWS). This policy {{was known as the}} [...] "white rule." [...] (The AQHA also would not register Appaloosa, cremello or perlino horses for similar reasons.) This policy arose in part from long observation of the tobiano spotting pattern, which is a dominant gene, and was known to not occur unless one parent is tobiano, a color not recognized in the <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds,</b> such as the Thoroughbred, that were the predecessors of the American Quarter Horse.|$|R

50|$|The Small Münsterländer (also SM or Kleiner Münsterländer) is a {{versatile}} hunting-pointing-retrieving dog breed that reached {{its current form}} {{in the area around}} Münster, Germany. The Large Münsterländer is from the same area, but was developed from different breeding stock and is not related as the names would suggest. Small Münsterländers bear a resemblance to both spaniels and setters but are more versatile while hunting on land and water. The Small Münsterländer is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale under Group 7, Section 1.2, Continental Pointing Dogs of Spaniel type, by the American Kennel Club as a <b>Foundation</b> <b>Breed,</b> and by The Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club as a gun dog. It is related to the Epagneul Français and the Drentsche Patrijshond.|$|E
5000|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is defined in}} each country by the respective registry, {{although there have been}} efforts to harmonize standards between countries. The {{breed standard}} defined by the Irish Draught Horse Breeders Association, and followed by the equivalent organization of Great Britain and Canada, states that [...] "The Irish Draught Horse is a versatile, powerful and athletic animal with substance and quality. It has a pleasant head, good bone and a short shin, good spring of rib, strong loins and hindquarters and an active powerful stride. Known for its good temperament, docility and willing nature, it has a robust constitution and is inherently sound. The Irish Draught horse is a <b>foundation</b> <b>breed</b> that, when crossed with other breeds, will produce all types of leisure and performance horses." ...|$|E
500|$|The three <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds</b> of the Azteca are the Andalusian (defined by the Mexican {{registry}} {{as either}} Pura Raza Española or Lusitano), American Quarter Horse, and Mexican Criollo or Criollo militar.

[...] Azteca stallions and geldings measure between [...] at the withers, while mares stand between [...] The ideal height is [...] [...] Both sexes usually weigh from [...] The facial profile of the breed is straight or [...] and the neck slightly arched. Overall, they are well-muscled horses, with broad croup and chest, as well as long, sloping shoulders. Gaits are free and mobile, with natural collection derived from the Andalusian ancestry of the breed. The breed is found in all solid colors, although gray is most often seen. White markings are allowed on the face and lower legs by breed associations. The American Azteca registry also allows non-solid pinto coloration.|$|R
50|$|While the Bandog {{is still}} a {{relatively}} rare breed, those familiar with a well-bred Bandog often develop the opinion of it being the perfect protection dog for their needs. Various programs have used the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Mastiff, and Neapolitan Mastiff for <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds,</b> but depending upon the program other breeds not mentioned here may have also been used. There are a few programs in existence today that have put forth the commitment necessary to produce multiple generations of Bandogs that are consistently producing working class lines of the breed. Because the Bandog {{is supposed to be}} a true working guard dog and because few programs actually put forth the effort to test their stock, it is wise verify the breeder's practice for testing their stock. This is because intention of quality Bandog breeders should be to combine the courage, tenacity, health, and athletic ability of the American Pit Bull Terrier with the larger size, power, and guarding instinct of the Mastiff.|$|R
5000|$|Colorpoint Shorthairs are {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} cat. Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all. These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors. The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the American Shorthair - the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals. The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof. In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds,</b> which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits. Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colourpoint Shorthairs that take after their American Shorthair ancestors in shape.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the name}} [...] "Schipperke" [...] was officially taken, the breed was also known colloquially as [...] "Spits" [...] or [...] "Spitzke", a name {{commonly}} used to describe a small dog with pointed ears. They were also occasionally called [...] "Moorke", meaning [...] "little black animal". Schipperkes are widely {{referred to in the}} United States, albeit erroneously, as [...] "Belgian barge dogs" [...] or [...] "Belgian ship dogs." [...] Apparently, however, their history dates to a seventeenth century black shepherd dog commonly called the Leuvenaar, a 40-pound dog often found in the Louvain region of Belgium and employed to guard flocks and transport. These dogs are apparently the <b>foundation</b> <b>breed</b> for both the modern, and smaller, Schipperke and the modern, and larger, Black Belgian Shepherd Dog, also known as the Groenendael.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of the name [...] "Bandog" [...] itself was revived in the mid-1960s when a veterinarian John B. Swinford selected quality specimens of specific <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds</b> to create what he {{considered to be the}} ultimate guard dog, a breed known as the Swinford Bandog. (or Swinford Bandogge). Using performance selection, Dr. Swinford concentrated the desired attributes for his creation and eliminated the undesired ones to produce what he believed was finest guard dog in existence. Swinford worked on his program for several generations, and came to receive significant recognition for his work in various books and journals., but unfortunately Dr. Swinford died in November 1971 before solidifying the future of his creation. For this reason, some people question the long term success of his program, but despite this questioning his work played a significant influential role in re-igniting the interest by some individuals and as a result there has been a resurrection of the Bandog name.|$|R
5000|$|The three <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds</b> of the Azteca are the Andalusian (defined by the Mexican {{registry}} {{as either}} Pura Raza Española or Lusitano), American Quarter Horse, and Mexican Criollo or Criollo militar.

500|$|According to {{the breed}} {{standard}} of the Mexican registry, Azteca horses cannot {{have more than}} 75 percent of their parentage from {{any one of the}} <b>foundation</b> <b>breeds</b> (Andalusian, Quarter Horse and Mexican Criollo); Criollo blood may be no more than 50%, and only from unregistered mares within Mexico. Horses are classified in one of six registration categories, designated with letters A through F, depending on their parentage. Only certain crosses between the different classes are permitted. [...] In Mexico, Azteca horses must conform to a strict phenotype standard established by the Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación (SAGARPA), the Mexican agriculture ministry, which requires inspection of foals at seven months for the issue of a [...] "birth certificate"; a foal that does not meet the breed standards may be denied registration even if both parents are registered Aztecas approved for breeding. Full registration and approval for breeding are subject to a second and more detailed inspection at age three or more, and granted only to those horses that fully satisfy the requirements of the standard.|$|R
