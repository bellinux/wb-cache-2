Mechanistic insights and the different stages that are involved in the merging process can be summarized as follows. First, the surfaces of the starting microspheres open up due to the dissolution of silica. Then the dissolved silica species provide mass source for the formation of particle necks connecting two neighboring microspheres. Gradually, surfaces of the starting microspheres are flattened to meet the needs of further growth of the necks. Finally, some chain-like highly-ordered mesoporous structures up to several micrometers are formed. The observed merging of the surfactant-containing microspheres is a re-assembling process, which is under the control of electrostatic force between the dissolved silica species and the surfactant cations.

40|$|Highly ordered {{mesoporous}} {{materials with}} extremely high hydrothermal stability {{have been successfully}} synthesized by a novel and facile approach. Our method is built on the understanding that the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> process {{plays an important role}} in the synthesis of mesoporous materials. It is proposed that in order to use high temperature <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> to increase the inorganic framework cross-linkage, an important requirement is that the organic surfactants must be retained as much as possible to maintain the preformed organic - inorganic composite mesostructure against framework shrinkage during the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> process. This requirement can be achieved by enhancing the surfactant - silanol interaction at the organic - inorganic interface through adjusting the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> pH and adding acetic acid (HAc) during the synthesis. When a high temperature (∼ 200 °C) <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> is employed, ordered mesoporous materials can only be obtained in a <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> pH range of 1 - 3. When the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> pH is near the isoelectric point of silica, the highest silanol density on silica walls can entrap the largest amount of surfactants within pores, resulting in highly ordered mesostructured materials. Moreover, the disadvantage of the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>treatment</b> under strong acidic conditions widely adopted in the literature has been revealed. Compared to previous reports, our approach is simple and does not involve environmentally unfriendly or expensive agents, thus is easy to be scaled up for industrial applications.
