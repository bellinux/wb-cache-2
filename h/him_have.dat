He settled in Fresno, California in 1922 and died five years later in 1927. Andranik is greatly admired as a national hero by Armenians; numerous statues of <b>him</b> <b>have</b> been erected in several countries. Streets and squares were named after Andranik, and songs, poems and novels {{have been written about}} him, making him a legendary figure in Armenian culture.|$|E
5|$|Domniile române... was {{simultaneously}} {{published in}} Bucharest (by Editura Socec), Leipzig (Otto Harrassowitz) and Vienna (Carl Gerold). It was then reprinted {{by the official}} Editura Academiei press, {{under the supervision of}} historian Nicolae Iorga. The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had gone into too much detail. The intervention was unwittingly destructive, as part of the documents cited by Filitti, and only by <b>him,</b> <b>have</b> since been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let <b>him</b> <b>have</b> it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E

5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let <b>him</b> <b>have</b> artistic control over the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow <b>him,</b> <b>have</b> Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|After Cofresí's death, items {{associated}} with <b>him</b> <b>have</b> been preserved or placed on display. His birth certificate is at San Miguel Arcángel Church {{with those of}} other notable figures, including Ramón Emeterio Betances and Salvador Brau. Earrings said to have been worn by Cofresi were owned by Ynocencia Ramírez de Arellano, a maternal cousin. Her great-great-grandson, collector Teodoro Vidal Santoni, gave them to the National Museum of American History in 1997 and the institution displayed them in a section devoted to Spanish colonial history. Locally, documents are preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture's General Archive of Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, the University of Puerto Rico's General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church's Parochial Archives. Outside Puerto Rico, records {{can be found at the}} National Archives Building and the General Archive of the Indies. However, official documents relating to Cofresí's trial and execution have been lost.|$|E

5|$|Coplas, {{songs and}} plays have been {{adapted from the}} oral tradition, and formal studies of the {{historical}} Cofresí and the legends surrounding <b>him</b> <b>have</b> appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ramon Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S.

5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute <b>him</b> <b>have</b> proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|In Latin Cantarini {{wrote the}} Vindex Sanguinis, a {{reply to the}} work on blood {{accusation}} of Jacob Geuze (Amsterdam, 1681). Three Latin letters by <b>him</b> <b>have</b> also been published; one of them dealing with natural history, is addressed to his teacher Bernardo de Laurentius (Padua, 1856, ed. Osimo).|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{strongly suggests}} that Cantor was quite confident in the result itself and that his comment to Dedekind refers instead to his then-still-lingering concerns {{about the validity of}} his proof of it. Nevertheless, Cantor's remark would also serve nicely to express the surprise that so many mathematicians after <b>him</b> <b>have</b> experienced on first encountering a result that is so counter-intuitive.|$|E

25|$|The Omega Nebula is {{a fairly}} bright nebula; it has an {{integrated}} magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth.
