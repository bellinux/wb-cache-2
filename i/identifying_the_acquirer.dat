30|$|The {{exclusion}} {{restrictions that}} <b>identify</b> Eq. (1)—where <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> change in transaction volume per POS terminal with debit cards (ACTVPOS) is the dependent variable—are the merchant debit card discount fee and the debit card annual fee—which {{are expected to}} be negatively related to merchant transaction volumes- and an interaction term of the merchant acceptance and the total number of debit cards in that network. This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> increases or <b>the</b> number of total debit cards increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual debit card fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank. It {{is important to note that}} only 6  % of banks in the sample charge an annual fee for debit cards. 6 Even so, we exploit such variation to infer the impact of debit card fees on acquirer (Eq.  1) and issuer (Eq.  2) volumes. As for Eq. (3) the exclusion restrictions also include a price for that side of the market—the debit card ATM fees- and the interaction of the number of debit cards in the network and the number of ATMs by issuer, which is expected to show ATM network effects.|$|R

We investigate the determinants of target CEO retention by <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> and whether target CEO retention affects the premium paid by <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> <b>The</b> probability that a CEO is retained increases with a private bidder, the performance of the target, and with the fraction of target shares held by insiders. Regardless of the bidder type, we find no evidence that the premium paid is lower when the CEO is retained by <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> Strikingly, <b>the</b> target stock price increases more at the announcement of an acquisition by a private firm when the CEO is retained than when she is not.

40|$|We shed {{new light}} on two {{question}}s. The first question is why some target CEOs are hired by <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms while others would depart after the acquisitions, more exactly, what characteristics of the target firms or target CEOs themselves would make them stay in or depart from <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms. <b>The</b> second question is {{about the influence of}} the hired target CEOs in the post-acquisition performance of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms. To answer the first question, we use a logistic regression to test the variables that might influence the target CEOs’ employment in <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms. We find that target CEOs {{are more likely to be}} hired by <b>acquirer</b> firms in <b>the</b> following cases: (1) the target firm has better pre-acquisition performance (2) the target CEO has stronger control over the target firm (3) the target CEO has more work experience (4) the method of payment is stock. For the second question, we estimate a multivariate OLS regression with two dummy variables reflecting how long target CEOs work in <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firm after <b>the</b> acquisitions, together with other pre-acquisition target/acquirer firm performance variables. Two measures of acquirer firms’ performance are also used in the model: a market-based measure (buy & hold market-adjusted return) and an accounting-based measure (industry adjusted return on asset). Our findings are as following: (1) Pre-acquisition target and acquirer firms’ performance (especially the target firms’ performance) have more significant and positive influence on the second-year post-acquisition performance of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms. (2) <b>The</b> hired target CEOs will negatively influence the first-year post-acquisition performance of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms. (3) <b>The</b> target CEOs hired by acquirer firms for at least two years will significantly improve the second-year post-acquisition performance of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firms and this positive effect might continue to the third year. ...|$|R

In such competitive business environment, software engineering projects are moving from Time & Material (TM) contracts to Fixed Price and Time (FPT) contracts that offers less risk to <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> Though, FPT contract is more risky to developer (supplier), the FPT contract offers more profit if risks are managed properly.

40|$|The {{financial}} media plays a {{key role}} in mergers and acquisitions. Yet, it is unclear why media content goes beyond public information available elsewhere. This paper develops and empirically confirms a theory that explains why media content predicts takeover outcomes. The media predicts takeover outcomes because it endogenously mitigates the informational asymmetry between <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> and target shareholders, who decide on the takeover outcome. To test the model’s prediction, this paper constructs an empirical measure that quantifies media content pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> It then estimates the intertemporal link between this measure and the outcome of takeovers. Consistent with theory, positive media content about <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> predicts takeover success...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{new evidence}} that market power is a motivation for takeovers. I develop a proxy based on the market concentration doctrine that measures whether a takeover is likely to cause {{an increase in the}} market power of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> In a test of the determinants of the takeover premium it is found that it is over 10 % higher when it is expected that <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> will gain additional market power in the transaction. This result indicates that, contrary to the existing literature, firms do use the market for corporate control as a tool to increase their market power. Furthermore, this thesis is the first study to consider the effect the influence a toehold provides <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> over <b>the</b> target has on the takeover premium. I develop a new non-linear model that allows for a more refined analysis of this. The results indicate that accounting for the degree of influence a toehold provides <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> is important when conducting empirical research on the takeover premium...|$|R

30|$|A {{majority}} of high-tech M&As is deemed to create economic value by extending existing capabilities [22, 25].

In this study we used 39 acquirers who has made acquisitions in the period between 1991 to 1998. This study applies event study method using the market model to calculate abnormal return. The hypothesis test used was the One Sample T-test, the Multiple Regressions, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Manova Test. Results of hypothesis testing showed that <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> receives a significant negative abnormal return along the date of acquisition. This indicates that the acquisition of events produce a lower return than predicted return is predicted by the shareholders of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> This study indicated several factors that affect the abnormal return as: financial synergy, size of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer,</b> managerial efficiency, growth of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer,</b> and business relatedness. Results of testing hypotheses against against these factors indicate that none of those variables that provide significant value. This means that the motives of the acquisition is not a motivation for acquirers to engage in activities acquisition. To assess the performance of companies <b>acquirer</b> in <b>the</b> long term, use a proxy such as: ROA, ROE, OPM. The test results showed that overall there was no significant difference between performance before and after the acquisition. This means that most acquirer firms are generally not able integrate acquirer gains against long-term performance. ...|$|R

50|$|In a cash merger, <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> {{offers to}} {{purchase}} the shares of the target for a certain price in cash. The target’s stock price will most likely increase when <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> makes <b>the</b> offer, but the stock price will remain below the offer value. In some cases, the target's stock price will increase to a level above the offer price. This would indicate that investors expect that a higher bid could be coming for the target, either from <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> or from a third party. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the target's stock. The arbitrageur makes a profit when the target's stock price approaches the offer price, which will occur when the likelihood of deal consummation increases. The target's stock price will be equal to the offer price upon deal completion.|$|R
40|$|The general {{findings}} of the merger literature have {{raised the question of}} why mergers continue to be so prevalent when there is no conclusive evidence of value gains. In particular, the zero or even negative stock price reaction of <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> firm surrounding <b>the</b> announcement has been puzzling. In order to provide insight into this apparent contradiction, this study examines the sources and the realization of synergistic gains from mergers and acquisitions more directly. Prior studies on the sources of synergy have not been very effective since the nature of the data may have obscured the true economic impact of mergers. Using the rich information gained from the U. S. hotel industry data from 1991 to 2009, this study investigates the sources of merger-related gains while controlling for the market condition. Along the way, the much-neglected area of value erosion from M&A is also addressed. The findings indicate that at the hotel property level, both the target and <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> show significant cost savings; target hotel properties achieve price gains when they are merged into similar brand families of <b>the</b> acquirer; <b>acquirer</b> hotel properties gain occupancy improvements from the demand spillover from the target hotel properties. The study also finds that local market conflicts {{have a negative impact on}} the revenue of both target and acquirer properties. No evidence was found for price-increasing collusion among the properties of the target and <b>the</b> <b>acquirer.</b> <b>The</b> investigation of the offer premium and the operating performance shows that the offer premium is positively associated with synergistic gains for <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> properties while it is non-significant for the target properties. These results suggest an interesting possibility that the premium may actually be a price to gain control over the target's resources, which is critical to generating value on <b>the</b> <b>acquirer</b> side...|$|R
