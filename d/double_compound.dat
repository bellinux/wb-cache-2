25|$|The {{first of}} these three boats, the 4,600-ton Puritan, built in 1887, was fitted with the largest walking beam engine ever built. She {{was also the first}} {{steamboat}} built for service on Long Island Sound to have a steel hull. The second was a smaller vessel, the 3,800-ton Plymouth, built in 1889. As it was decided that the walking beam engine had reached its practical limit in Puritan, Plymouth was installed with a more modern triple expansion engine instead. The last of the three vessels was the 5,300-ton Priscilla, built in 1894, which had a <b>double</b> <b>compound</b> engine and Scotch boilers. All three of these vessels were considered in their day to be the epitome of elegance and sophistication and gave many years of service on Long Island Sound.|$|E

40|$|A 3 -year-old female red {{corn snake}} (Pantherophis guttatus) was {{presented}} for a three-week history of anorexia and decreased defecations. On physical examination, a soft midbody intracoelomic swelling was palpated. Transcutaneous coelomic ultrasound revealed a target-like mass on a transverse {{section of the}} stomach, suggesting {{the presence of a}} gastrointestinal intussusception. On exploratory coeliotomy, a <b>double</b> <b>compounded</b> esophagogastric and gastroduodenal intussusception was diagnosed and reduced surgically. A gastropexy was also performed to prevent recurrence. On histopathology, the gastric glandular mucosa showed moderate to marked proliferation. Diffusely lining the luminal surface of glandular epithelium and free within the lumen were a myriad of protozoa consistent with Cryptosporidium sp. A diagnosis of chronic proliferative gastritis due to Cryptosporidium sp. was made based on these findings. Intussusceptions are rare in reptiles and are infrequently reported in snakes. This is the first report of a <b>double</b> <b>compounded</b> intussusception in a nonmammalian species and the first report of an intussusception involving the stomach in a snake with gastritis due to Cryptosporidium sp...|$|R
