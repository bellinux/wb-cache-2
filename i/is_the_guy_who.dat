500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I {{think that was a}} curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E

2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year.

[...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago {{during a}} tight pennant race, Newman {{took a turn}} in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits. Shortly after completion, Newman {{collapsed}} {{on the field and}} was immediately rushed to the hospital. After several tests, it was determined he had suffered a brain hemorrhage. His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down like that, because this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E
