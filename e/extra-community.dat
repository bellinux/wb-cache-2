40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple model that depicts the {{relationship}} between community and <b>extra-community</b> stakeholders that will enable the effective development of sustainable tourism. "Sustainable tourism" in this paper is defined as tourism that utilizes community resources for tourism development and re-invests the returns from tourism to the destination resources. The tourism relationship model, with a community-based intermediary as its subsystem, is introduced and applied to a case in Hokkaido, Japan. The application demonstrates that the model is a valid tool to identify two important factors for successful development of sustainable tourism, which are a "circulation mechanism" that connects community resources and <b>extra-community</b> stakeholders through community-based intermediaries, and a "balancing mechanism" that considers the existence value and economic value, supplemented by the community-based intermediary's functions to transfer financial and technology capital from non-tourist sources.

The aim of the current paper is to solve this initial puzzle. As traditional social capital literature is not able to explain the low level of trust in this case, we propose a comprehensive approach incorporating the analysis of immigration, integration, inequality and access to justice data to shed light on trust-eliminating mechanisms. The social and economic aspects are examined in the matrix of <b>extra-community</b> network, intra-community trust, radius of trust and need for formal external enforcement. Four factors – concentrated highly diverse areas, tight communities living next to each other with limited <b>extra-community</b> links, minorities’ high exposure to deprivation and limited access to justice – are identified as the origin of our puzzle. As social trust plays a fundamental role in enhancing economic growth, the trust-impeding mechanisms explored in the current paper shall be of great importanc...|$|E

This study empirically explores the relationships between self-employed workers' involvement in local communities and their earnings. Examining whether their weak ties with community members and strong ties with their neighbors work differently, we hypothesize that while the former yields positive returns, a high involvement in their neighborhoods limits self-employed workers' access to <b>extra-community</b> contacts, causes free-rider problems, and produces leveling pressures. Our findings suggest that participating in local community organizations significantly raises self-employment earnings.

Household-related risk is ususally considered individual or private, but measures to manage risk are actually social or public in nature. Furthermore, various externality issues are associated with household-related risk, such as its links to economic development, poverty reduction, social cohesion, and environmental quality. Hence the need for a holistic approach to risk management, or"social risk management,"which encompasses a broad spectrum of private and public actions. An asset-based approach to social risk management is presented, which provides an integrated approach to considering household, community, and <b>extra-community</b> assets and risk-management strategies.

We excluded ECG'S which operate on other than a local basis; thus, we do not study primarily <b>extra-community</b> oriented groups (whether at a regional, state, or national level). Our focus is on those local groups which appear before or after a disaster and not those which emerge during the emergency the period, such as search and rescue teams.

40|$|We use {{the network}} science concept of {{modularity}} to measure polarization in the United States Congress. As {{a measure of}} the relationship between intra-community and <b>extra-community</b> ties, modularity provides a conceptually-clear measure of polarization that directly reveals both the number of relevant groups and the strength of their divisions. Moreover, unlike measures based on spatial models, modularity does not require predefined assumptions about the number of coalitions or parties, the shape of legislator utilities, or the structure of the party system. Importantly, modularity can be used to measure polarization across all Congresses, including those without a clear party divide, thereby permitting the investigation of partisan polarization across a broader range of historical contexts. Using this novel measure of polarization, we show that party influence on Congressional communities varies widely over time, especially in the Senate. We compare modularity to extant polarization measures, noting that existing methods underestimate polarization in periods in which party structures are weak, leading to artificial exaggerations of the extremeness of the recent rise in polarization. We show that modularity is a significant predictor of future majority party changes in the House and Senate and that turnover is more prevalent at medium levels of modularity. We utilize two individual-level variables, which we call “divisiveness ” and “solidarity”, from modularity an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{level of}} {{community}} {{is considered to}} be vital for building disaster resilience. Yet, community resilience as a scientific concept often remains vaguely defined and lacks the guiding characteristics necessary for analysing and enhancing resilience on the ground. The emBRACE framework of community resilience presented in this paper provides a heuristic analytical tool for understanding, explaining and measuring community resilience to natural hazards. It was developed in an iterative process building on existing scholarly debates, on empirical case study work in five countries and on participatory consultation with community stakeholders, where the framework was applied and ground-tested in different contexts and for different hazard types. The framework conceptualizes resilience across three core domains: resources and capacities; actions; and learning. These three domains are conceptualized as intrinsically conjoined within a whole. Community resilience is influenced by these integral elements as well as by <b>extra-community</b> forces, comprising disaster risk governance and thus laws, policies and responsibilities {{on the one hand and}} on the other, the general societal context, natural and human-made disturbances and system change over time. The framework is a graphically rendered heuristic, which through application can assist in guiding the assessment of community resilience in a systematic way and identifying key drivers and barriers of resilience that affect any particular hazard-exposed community...|$|E
40|$|Conference paper {{presented}} at the 1 st African Conference on Sustainable Tourism in Strathmore University, Kenya. This paper examines the effectiveness of community participation in tourism development and introduces the community based-tourism relationship model as applied to a case in Ada, Ghana. The application demonstrates that the model is a tool for successful development of sustainable tourism. It focuses on the “circulation mechanism” that connects community resources and <b>extra-community</b> stakeholders through community-based intermediaries, and a “balancing mechanism” that considers the existence value and economic value, supplemented by the community-based intermediary‟s functions to transfer financial and technology capital from tourist sources. Other researchers including Butler, 1998, suggest that community-based tourism development may provide an opportunity for a sustainable tourism industry. An empirical study was conducted with descriptive and exploratory survey adopted for this study. Primary data for the study was obtained through structured and unstructured interviews with locals, tourists, traditional council and district officials. 65 % of the respondent indicated that tourism development in the area has a positive impact on job creation and it should be inclusive of the area inhabitants. Community-based tourism is seen as an all-inclusive bottom-up approach to tourism planning and development that incorporates local entrepreneurs in the planning process, in a meaningful way. Collaboration amongst all key stakeholders is imperative for creating a sustainable enabling environment for all inclusive participation in community based tourism...|$|E
40|$|With an {{increasing}} international trade, a {{more and more}} significant expansion was experienced by combined commercial operations, also including goods processing transactions. The expansion of these international economic affairs had as motivation the multiple direct and indirect positive effects they produce both at micro and macro level, such as: obtaining a significant commercial profit and on this basis, increasing the currency contribution, increasing the general indicator of the international trade volume, relieving the balance of external payments of certain payments in currency, making optimum use of production capacity and labour force etc. Given {{the complexity of the}} combined commercial operations of foreign trade, in this article we shall address the commercial transactions of inward processing of foreign goods in terms of accounting models specific for conducting these transactions. In this regard, after the theoretical delimitation of these operations we shall emphasize the benefits of inward processing of foreign goods but also without forgetting the limitations of these international commercial operations. To develop accounting models we shall first clarify the tax matters that affect the entry in the accounts of inward processing of foreign goods, then we shall proceed to their reflection in accounting starting from a case study, if the recipient of such operations is based in the <b>extra-community</b> or community area.

40|$|Current {{thinking}} in major international development agencies construes community-based health insurance (CBHI) as a transitional mechanism to achieving universal coverage {{for health care}} in low-income countries. The policy link between CBHI and universal coverage is implicitly determined by the historical experience of mutual health insurance {{in countries such as}} Germany and Japan in the 19 th century, where the socioeconomic context was dramatically different to that of today’s much less successful schemes. This paper argues that the economic and health system frameworks employed in the analysis of CBHI have not taken into account context-dependent considerations such as goals, values and power. It is proposed that a critical engagement with social capital theories could contribute to our understanding of why CBHI schemes do not appear on course to develop according to the 19 th century precedent, achieving significant levels of population coverage in a sustainable way. A framework of social capital and economic development is used to organize and interpret existing evidence and information on CBHI. This process suggests that solidarity, trust, <b>extra-community</b> networks, vertical civil society links and state-society relations at the local level affect the possibility of success of CBHI. To this extent, {{it may be possible to}} talk of “social determinants of CBHI”. In order to align themselves to local community goals and values, CBHI schemes may need to actively foster certain types of vertical and horizontal bridging relations which could result in the evolution of structures and operations quite different to those proposed by current models of CBHI...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{structure}} of three contiguous wild chimpanzee communities in West Africa was examined {{to determine the}} extent to which the community, the mixed-sex social unit of chimpanzees, represents a closed reproductive unit. An analysis of paternity for 41 offspring resulted in 34 cases of paternity assignment to an adult male belonging to the same community. Among the 14 offspring for which all potential within-community fathers have been tested, one likely case of extra-group paternity (EGP) has been identified, suggesting an incidence of EGP of 7 %. This more extensive analysis contradicts a previous genetic study of the Taï chimpanzees that inferred 50 % extra-group fathers. We suggest, based on direct comparison of results for 33 individuals at 1 microsatellite locus and direct comparison of paternity assignments for 11 offspring, that the error rate in the previous study was too high to produce accurate genotypes and assignments of paternity and hence caused the false inference of a high rate of EGP. Thus, the community is the primary but not exclusive unit for reproduction in wild chimpanzees, and females do not typically reproduce with outside males. Despite the inferred low level of gene flow from <b>extra-community</b> males, relatedness levels among the community males are not significantly higher than among community females, and the distribution of genetic relationships within the group suggests that, rather than a primarily male-bonded social structure, the group is bonded through relationships between males and females. Kinship may explain cooperative behaviors directed against other communities, but is unlikely to explain the high levels of affiliation and cooperation seen for male within-community interactions...|$|E

Our Nation seems to be a “docking point” for new and substantial flow of immigrants mainly from Eastern Europe looking for new work opportunities. The profile of these people is usually characterized by high level of education as well as flexibility and adaptability. For the national economy in general, and for the agricultural sector in particular, this new migration flows represent an effective answer to the aversion for the agricultural job expressed by many potential autochthon workers. Which are the characteristics of <b>extra-community</b> agricultural labour? Which are the characteristics of migration flows linked to the agricultural labour in three provinces of one of the main agricultural regions in Italy? Based on National Institute of Welfare information’s (INPS), the research underlines the diversification of this phenomenon among Italian regions as well as its dynamism. In Italy, during the last five years, the proportions of foreign agricultural workers increased up to 50 %, and peaked in four Italian regions: Friuli Venezia Giulia, Campania, Piemonte and Emilia-Romagna. In Emilia-Romagna, in particular, immigrants represent almost a quarter of total agricultural workers and most of them aged less than forty years. The analysis of information about labour market in the agricultural sector in some Emilia-Romagna provinces shows that immigrants are concentrated in few farms. Farmer prefers to engage homogeneous ethnic groups to assure cultural affinity among the employees. In the local agricultural labour market the immigrants coming from Eastern Europe, in particular from Poland and Romania, are aged between 22 and 36 years, are unemployed in their country, they have a driving license and a good knowledge of Italian and English language.

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{regressive}} {{impacts of}} structural adjustment on most African countries, creating “viable” markets have now become an important goal for development interventions. At the same time, devolving responsibility from the state to local actors is now accepted as a critical ingredient for successful development. Underlying these shifts in the development discourse is {{the idea is that}} rules and responsibilities can be successfully realigned between different actors and institutions. This paper considers the various logics of institutional coordination evident in current efforts to promote wildlife management in Botswana through community collaborations with state regulators and private concerns. As communities, bureaucrats and firms develop new rules to conserve wildlife and alter agricultural practices, state and market structures become “embedded” in institutional and cultural patterns of African communities in new ways. The paper traces institutional patterns and organizational capacities that emerge through the articulation of imposed and pre-existing institutional logics. The infusion of market and state logics is often incomplete and older logics of social organization can become the raw materials for the creation of new institutional practices. An interesting finding of this research is that <b>extra-community</b> actors idealize the way in which communities are embedded in reciprocal-personalistic relationships and economy of affection structures. The state purports to provide an enabling environment by providing a legal framework. However, in reality we see the state’s embeddedness in its paternalistic view of local people, as “children who need grow up. ” Market actors exhibit their embeddedness by masking their profit motive behind the idioms of reciprocity. Local communities re-work legacies of prior marginalization through the idiom of community based market-friendly conservation strategies to gain access to areas from which they were excluded in the past. The findings in this paper thus deepen our theoretical understanding of the social embeddedness {{of the state and the}} market. At the same time, the articulations highlighted in the paper helps us specify and explore more precisely the ways in which culture and tradition bound choice and preference formation...|$|E

It then goes on to explore the European Commission’s objectives and assumptions concerning its calls for a sizeable increase in labour migration from third countries. Besides relating this to the internal requirements of the EU’s transforming labour market, it also discusses the external ramifications of the EU’s developing labour migration policy. The remaining sections scrutinize the EU’s emerging asylum policy. It attends, inter alia, to the EU’s ever-widening smorgasbord of restrictive asylum instruments and security-oriented immigration policies, which, as the paper goes on to argue, together serve to transform the right of asylum into a problem of ‘illegal immigration’.

First made {{available}} online 14 January 2015. Portugal {{is a very}} good illustration of the current identity quests that are pursued by communities of all shapes and sizes – local, national, supranational, international, civilizational – in response to old urges and new threats posed in a globalised, but also “glocalised”, world. Torn between its European body and its atlantic/lusophone “soul”, Portugal tries {{to strike a balance between}} the two dimensions of its identity as a polity and, in the process, claims a special role as mediator between north and south, Europe and the African continent. Although fully committed to the European immigration policy, with its restrictive dimensions and its focus on integration, Portugal purports to articulate the European demands with the special solidarity bonds that exist with the Portuguese speaking countries. It has been so for a number of years, but the recent developments in both the Portuguese nationality and immigration laws show that the fears expressed by many that Schengen would surpass the lusophone ties were well founded and that, no matter how well intended the Portuguese policies are in these matters, the result will be detrimental to the so-called lusophone citizens. They do enjoy a special status – encompassing voting rights and access to public office that is generally forbidden to all foreigners (a status unparalleled in the two other European countries under scrutiny, France and the United Kingdom) – but their access to the Portuguese territory has been curtailed. Even more than Portugal, which until recently was the last of the European “nation states” and only now faces visible cultural diversity in its society, the European Union and the Community of the Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) struggle with the definition of their respective identities and sense of purpose, seeking to win the hearts and minds of their peoples. Commonly considered a natural spontaneous community, due to the existence of a common language, the CPLP faces the difficulties posed by mutual distrust and old grudges and the fear, by many, that it is only an expression of imperial nostalgia on the part of Portugal. Its member states show only a mild commitment, engaged as they all are in other regional communities of their own, as can be seen in the discussions on citizenship and free movement within the lusophone area. There are many similarities between the legal systems of the CPLP member states, which can be explained by the cooperation between lawyers and academics specially in Africa and East Timor, but some of those similarities are merely formal, with little correspondence in the law in action, and coexist with relevant differences due mostly to different levels of socio-economic development and political will. For the European Union the purpose of fostering a feeling of belonging and solidarity between the peoples of Europe is an ongoing struggle for legitimacy which has suffered major setbacks in recent years. After the constitutional momentum, the Union has adopted a more modest stance, but has by no means given up winning the support of the European citizens. One of the fields in which its intervention is demanded is directly linked with the identity quest in progress – border definition and control, policies towards illegal and legal aliens. Stressing the need to integrate the third country nationals who are legal residents and adopting the mantra of intercultural dialogue, the EU presents itself as a guardian for human rights and a fighter against racism, at the same time as it tries to keep Europe for the Europeans as much as possible. Its member states are willing, for European or domestic reasons, to go along and easily drop old preferences for <b>extra-community</b> bonds of solidarity. Portugal may again be the last of the empires, keeping a special status for the foreigners of lusophone origin, but it nevertheless keeps with the times when it comes to admission to its territory...|$|E
