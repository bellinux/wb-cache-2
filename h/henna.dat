Somali <b>henna</b> designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of <b>henna</b> and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. <b>Henna</b> parties are usually held before the wedding takes place.

The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called <b>henna,</b> a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with <b>henna</b> because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours.

Barbaros Hızır Hayreddin Pasha died in 1546 of a fever, possibly the plague.|$|E
25|$|Painting {{the human}} body in black is also {{employed}} in low-key photography using non-toxic dyes or pigments in order to darken and enhance {{as much as possible}} the colour of the subjects photographed, and to achieve the desired effects.

25|$|The poet {{has used}} vibrant senses of human body to {{describe}} the majesty of the Hyderabadi traditional bazaar. Visual depiction is described {{by the use of}} lively colours such as silver, crimson, purple, amber, blue, azure, red and white. Aural depiction is created through the melody of the sitar, the sarangi, the drums and the chanting of the magical spells by the magicians. Olfactory senses are stimulated through the use of the fragrances describing sandalwood, <b>henna</b> and the smell of flowers. Gustatory depiction is created through the portrayal of the fruits like lemons, pomegranates, plums and principal Hyderabad food such as lentils and rice. In the last, the palpable imagery is produced by the bells made for the pigeons.|$|E
25|$|Shopping on {{this day}} begin very early as this is when there is the best selection. However, {{not all of the}} vendors on Sunday sell second hand items.

There are also vendors selling other things related to fashion, such as <b>henna</b> tattoos and custom fingernail work.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). <b>Henna</b> has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E

500|$|According to French film {{historian}} Yves Thoraval, the film's {{theme is}} [...] "the Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister". Ramachandran notes that like {{the characters in}} Bairavi (1978), Kali and his sister have abusive parents in childhood and {{he is responsible for}} his sister's welfare. Unlike Bairavi, the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession.

[...] Soon after the release of the magazine Gair became such a pop culture icon that she was considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign according to a story in The New York Times.
