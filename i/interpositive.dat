5|$|Image Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} both the English and Italian versions on DVD on August 1, 2000. Kino {{released the}} film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm <b>interpositive</b> in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy {{was very difficult to}} restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order.|$|E
5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the <b>interpositive,</b> similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
25|$|Later color {{films were}} {{standardized}} into two distinct processes: Eastman Color Negative 2 chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating <b>interpositive</b> and internegative stocks) and Eastman Color Positive 2 chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products {{are compatible with}} ECN-2 and ECP-2.|$|E

500|$|Audition was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on DVD by Tartan Video on June 28, 2004. The disc contained an interview with Miike and liner notes by Joe Cornish. Matthew Leyland (Sight & Sound) reviewed this release, stating that the audio and visual presentation was [...] "exemplary" [...] while noting that the interview with Miike was the only noteworthy bonus feature on the disc. The film was later released by Arrow Video on February 29, 2016. The Arrow Video release was exclusively restored in 2K resolution and was scanned from a 35mm <b>interpositive.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Network DVD re-issued Year One in the UK as a Special Edition seven-disc box set. For this release, to {{coincide}} with the series' 30th Anniversary, each episode was digitally restored by creating new 35mm film elements (a new <b>interpositive</b> made from the original negative which is then used to make further copies). High Definition digital transfers were then made from the interpositives using a state-of-the-art Philips Spirit DataCine. [...] This vastly improved the picture quality in comparison to the previous DVD releases, however the restoration process has actually made some of the space scenes (that involve special effects and model work) less realistic due to increased brightness and contrast (a comparison can be viewed here [...] ). This box set also included two booklets and a new set of extra features that were not on the Carlton DVD releases, including featurettes on [...] "Concept & Creation" [...] and [...] "Special Effects & Design" [...] (edited from an earlier [...] "Fanderson" [...] documentary made in 1996), textless and alternative opening and closing title sequences, a two-part Clapperboard special on Gerry Anderson from 1975, and also a brand new 70-minute documentary entitled [...] "These Episodes" [...] in which Anderson, Christopher Penfold, Johnny Byrne, Zienia Merton and David Lane reflect on the making of key episodes from the first series.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as a Protection IP, which is a good term since the only time the IP is touched is on the occasion of making the first or a replacement internegative. Since <b>interpositives</b> are used so rarely, they are usually the film element that is in the best condition of all the film elements.|$|R
50|$|From a {{traditional}} photographic perspective, an <b>interpositive</b> {{is essentially a}} negative processed in a positive process. An original negative is exposed to film in-where the film is processed creating a like image, 'a negative', in a positive process, an <b>interpositive.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bleach bypass {{can be done}} to any {{photochemical}} step in the process, be it original camera negative, <b>interpositive,</b> internegative, or release print. For motion pictures, it {{is usually}} applied at the internegative stage, as insurance companies usually are reluctant to have the camera negative bleach bypassed, or the <b>interpositive</b> (a [...] "protection"/"preservation" [...] element), in the event that the look is agreed to be too extreme, and the cost of the process for each individual release print is most often cost-prohibitive. The effect, however, will render slightly differently at each stage, especially between the camera negative and <b>interpositive</b> stages.|$|E

50|$|This {{was one of}} {{the very}} few {{instances}} where a Western Bloc recommendation and standard was adopted by the Eastern Bloc, but was wholly rejected by the very bloc which proposed its adoption. To this day, all Western Bloc professional cameras employ BH perforations, and so also do the intermediate applications (<b>interpositives</b> and internegatives, also known as the IP/IN process).|$|R

50|$|After a film is shot, the {{original}} negatives—taken {{directly from the}} camera equipment—are edited into correct sequence and printed onto fresh stock as a cohesive film, creating an <b>interpositive</b> print used for color timing. From the <b>interpositive,</b> answer prints, which include the color-corrected imagery and a properly synced sound track, are made. Once approved by the studio, the final answer print is made into an internegative used for striking copies that will be delivered to theaters for viewing.|$|E
