40|$|Flat-slab {{construction}} {{has been widely}} used in construction today because of many advantages that it offers. The basic philosophy {{in the design of}} flat slab is to consider only gravity forces; this method ignores the effect of punching shear due to unbalanced moments at the slab column junction which is critical. An attempt has been made to generate generalized <b>design</b> <b>sheets</b> which accounts both punching shear due to gravity loads and unbalanced moments for cases (a) interior column; (b) edge column (bending perpendicular to shorter edge); (c) edge column (bending parallel to shorter edge); (d) corner column. These <b>design</b> <b>sheets</b> are prepared as per codal provisions of IS 456 - 2000. These <b>design</b> <b>sheets</b> will be helpful in calculating the shear reinforcement to be provided at the critical section which is ignored in many design offices. Apart from its usefulness in evaluating punching shear and the necessary shear reinforcement, the <b>design</b> <b>sheets</b> developed will enable the designer to fix the depth of flat slab during the initial phase of the design...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a constraint management methodology, which facilitates tradeoff studies during conceptual design. This approach represents design models as constraints between variables, {{and uses the}} resulting constraint network to automatically derive computational procedures for performing userspecified tradeoff studies.

When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings {{are surrounded by}} the core, the transformer is shell <b>form.</b> Shell <b>form</b> <b>design</b> may be more prevalent than core <b>form</b> <b>design</b> for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.

At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.

40|$|Affective {{responses}} concern customers’ affective {{needs and}} have received increasing attention in consumer-focused research. To design {{a product that}} appeals to consumers, designers should consider multiple affective responses (MARs). Designing products capable of satisfying MARs {{falls into the category}} of multiobjective optimization (MOO). However, when exploring optimal product <b>form</b> <b>design,</b> most relevant studies have transformed multiple objectives into a single objective, which limits their usefulness to designers and consumers. To optimize product <b>form</b> <b>design</b> for MARs, this paper proposes an integrated model based on MOO and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM). First, design analysis is applied to identify design variables and MARs; quantification theory type I is then employed to build the relationship models between them; {{on the basis of these}} models, an MOO model for optimization of product <b>form</b> <b>design</b> is constructed. Next, we use nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) as a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve the MOO model and thereby derive Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, we adopt the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to obtain the optimal design from the Pareto solutions. A case study of car <b>form</b> <b>design</b> is conducted to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results suggest that this approach is feasible and effective in obtaining optimal designs and can provide great insight for product <b>form</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R
