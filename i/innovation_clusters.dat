50|$|The {{technological}} view {{of change}} needs {{to demonstrate that}} changes {{in the rate of}} innovation governs changes in the rate of new investments, and that the combined impact of <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> takes the form of fluctuation in aggregate output or employment. The process of technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among a set of key variables: inventions, innovations, diffusion paths and investment activities. The impact of technological innovation on aggregate output is mediated through a succession of relationships that have yet to be explored systematically in the context of long wave. New inventions are typically primitive, their performance is usually poorer than existing technologies and the cost of their production is high. A production technology may not yet exist, {{as is often the case}} in major chemical inventions, pharmaceutical inventions. The speed with which inventions are transformed into innovations and diffused depends on actual and expected trajectory of performance improvement and cost reduction.|$|E

40|$|<b>Innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> {{continue}} {{to be an important}} focus of economic development policies in many nations. Leading <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> demonstrate that regional concentration strengthens the innovative capability and can lead to successful competitiveness on a global level, as demonstrated by regions such as Silicon Valley (US), Cambridge (UK) and Sophia Antipolis (France). However the successful creation of clusters still presents a challenge to policy makers as efforts to do so regularly fail. The development of <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> has therefore received much academic and policymaker attention. While past research has examined a variety of factors as drivers for clustering effects, the role of communication within the cluster - and, specifically, the role of key individual communicators - in underpinning successful cluster development has received almost no academic attention. In this chapter, we will draw upon the relevant literature to develop a conceptual framework that will underpin research on this important topic by investigating the role of communicators in <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters.</b> Building on communication theories, the framework suggests that there are four influence-levels that shape and impact the role of communications in innovation clusters: the Individual Level, the Organizational Level, the Cluster Level and the Context. The interdisciplinary view on clustering effects contributes valuable insight to both communication studies and cluster theories. The framework developed within this chapter provides a structure to aid future research on the role of communicators within <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters...</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{assume that}} the {{transition}} from traditional regional networking in old clusters to networking towards innovation must rely primarily on the shift from the rent-seeking of a closed system to a culture of open and disruptive innovation. Applying the concept of organizational deviance to innovation networks will shed new light on how <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> can be kept on track by cluster governance in order to safeguard the innovation path for which these <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> were given financial investments.|$|E
30|$|It {{appears that}} the {{management}} of the transition phase and the repurposing of social networks must be critical success factors for innovation and modernization. Indeed, members of <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> must necessarily enter into conflict with both the established procedures and the formal institutional routines and rules that are inadequate for innovative disruption. In the absence of governance and a stable cognitive reference model for the transition, <b>innovation</b> <b>clusters</b> are likely to fall back on established, trust-based informal rules (Pohlmann 2008).|$|E
