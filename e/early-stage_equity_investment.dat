40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Within {{the private}} <b>equity</b> {{spectrum}} of <b>investment</b> stages, venture capital and early stage investments are heralded as critical {{where it has}} been shown that an increase in private <b>equity</b> <b>early-stage</b> <b>investments</b> of 0. 1 % of GDP is associated with an increase in real economic growth of 0. 96 % (Meyer, 2010). This dissertation suggests that within the South African private equity industry fund managers are preoccupied with competing for later stage investments. The study also proposes that the early stage private equity spectrum is severely under-represented in South Africa. Even though there is a healthy distribution between investors as well as the stage of investment they prefer within venture capital, the study suggests that the lack of total funds committed to early stage investments could be a limiting factor for job creation and economic growth...|$|R

40|$|As a {{new type}} of {{investment}} and financing method, the private <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> saw rapid development in China. The private <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> can not only provide financial support for enterprises, but also can improve the corporate governance structure and management level depending on the advantage of financial management and advisory experts. However, the fundamental purpose of private <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> institutions is to obtain high income, and whether the high income can be achieved depends on the success of capital withdrawal. Capital withdrawal, i. e. exit {{is an important part of}} normal operation for private <b>equity</b> <b>investment.</b> This paper will build an exit mechanism for private <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> through analysis of the selection of the three factors, which are ways to exit, timing of exit and degree of exit. &# 13; Key words: Private equity investment; Way to exit; Timing of exit; Degree of exi...|$|R

The results suggest a positive influence of banks' <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> on banks' interest rate margin and banks' net income that is not outweighed by additional requirements of provisions and capital that supervisory authorities establish to control bank risk. The positive effect <b>equity</b> <b>investments</b> have on banks' interest margin {{is consistent with the}} banks' ability as shareholders to obtain benefits in the lending relationship they also keep with firms. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether {{the determinants of}} international <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> differ between investors with different degrees of sophistication. For this purpose, we analyse and compare the determinants of international <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries (US not included) in the period 2001 - 2009. The results show that there are {{significant differences in the}} determinants of international <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> between institutional and noninstitutional investors. In particular, noninstitutional investors tend to exhibit a more pronounced preference for equities of geographical nearby, contiguous and more transparent countries than institutional investors. The preference for more developed equity markets and the contrarian behaviour are also significantly more pronounced for noninstitutional than for institutional investors. These results support the argument that international <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> of less sophisticated investors is more affected by information costs and familiarity than that of more sophisticated investors. Moreover, business cycles exert an influence on international <b>equity</b> <b>investment</b> decisions of both institutional and noninstitutional investors.
