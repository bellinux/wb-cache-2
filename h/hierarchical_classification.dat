Within a few decades additional genera had been recognized, and this trend continued in the ensuing years, together {{with the development of}} a more complex <b>hierarchical</b> <b>classification</b> in which genera were apportioned among subfamilies and tribes. The ant species described by Linnaeus are now dispersed in eleven different genera, belonging to four subfamilies.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) {{by making a}} series of choices between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>classification</b> of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

The basic observation is that each set of rules induced by the data canonically determines a classificational hierarchy.

The framework is then applied to the induction of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>classifications</b> from an amino acid database.

40|$|Abstract — Multi label {{classification}} is {{variation of}} single label classification where each instance {{is associated with}} more than one class labels. Multi label classification is used in many applications like text classification, gene functionality, image processing etc. <b>Hierarchical</b> multi-label <b>classification</b> problems combine the characteristics of both <b>hierarchical</b> and multi-label <b>classification</b> problems. This paper introduced k binary classifier and one classifier approaches of <b>hierarchical</b> multi label <b>classification.</b> These approaches are explained with two algorithms to solve <b>hierarchical</b> multi label <b>classification</b> problems. One is the C 4. 5 H algorithm (extension of multi label decision tree) and second is Predictive Clustering Tree (PCT) algorithm. From theoretical and experimental study on yeast data set shows that PCT algorithm is the best option for <b>hierarchical</b> multi label <b>classification.</b> PCT algorithm is implemented on Clus.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Hierarchical</b> Multi-Label <b>Classification</b> is {{a complex}} classifi-cation problem where the classes are hierarchically structured. This task is very common in protein {{function}} prediction, where each protein can {{have more than one}} function, which in turn can have more than one sub-function. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>hierarchical</b> multi-label <b>classification</b> algorithm for protein function prediction, namely HMC-PC. It is based on probabilistic clustering, and it makes use of cluster membership probabilities in order to generate the predicted class vec-tor. We perform an extensive empirical analysis in which we compare our new approach to four different <b>hierarchical</b> multi-label <b>classification</b> algorithms, in protein function datasets structured both as trees and di-rected acyclic graphs.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{proposes a}} novel Ant Colony Optimisation {{algorithm}} (ACO) tailored for the <b>hierarchical</b> multilabel <b>classification</b> problem of protein function prediction. This {{problem is a}} very active research field, given the large {{increase in the number}} of uncharacterised proteins available for analysis and the importance of determining their functions in order to improve the current biological knowledge. Since it is known that a protein can perform more than one function and many protein functional-definition schemes are organised in a <b>hierarchical</b> structure, the <b>classification</b> problem in this case is an instance of a hierarchical multi-label problem. In this type of problem, each example may belong to multiple class labels and class labels are organised in a hierarchical structure—either a tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. It presents a more complex problem than conventional flat classification, given that the classification algorithm has to take into account hierarchical relationships between class labels and be able to predict multiple class labels for the same example. The proposed ACO algorithm discovers an ordered list of <b>hierarchical</b> multi-label <b>classification</b> rules. It is evaluated on sixteen challenging bioinformatics data sets involving hundreds or thousands of class labels to be predicted and compared against state-of-theart decision tree induction algorithms for <b>hierarchical</b> multilabel <b>classification.</b> Keywords <b>hierarchical</b> multi-label <b>classification</b> · ant colony optimisation · protein function predictio...|$|R
