25|$|Flight day 6 was {{dedicated}} to transferring supplies from the MPLM Leonardo and the space shuttle mid-deck. The crews transferred the Windows Observational Research Facility (WORF) to the Destiny lab. Mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki, along with flight engineer Soichi Noguchi also transferred the Express Rack 7 (ER7) to its final location. During the crews morning, a smoke alarm sounded in the Russian segment of the station, which prompted the joint crew to move into emergency procedures. However the alarm was false and was cleared {{within a couple of}} minutes and all normal work resumed. Mission specialists Clay Anderson, Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson conducted in-flight interviews with Nebraska Public Radio, CBS Newspath and Radio Network and KETV-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger talked with students at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. At the end of the crews work day, the joint crew got together and reviewed the procedures for the second spacewalk. After the procedures review spacewalkers Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio entered the Quest airlock, closed the hatch and lowered the <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> to 10.2 psi. The pair also breathed pure oxygen for an hour while the pressure was being lowered.|$|E
60|$|Ricardo disregarded the question. The {{material}} {{vision of}} the spoil absorbed all his faculties. A great vision! He seemed to see it. A few small canvas bags tied up with thin cord, their distended rotundity showing the <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> of the disk-like forms of coins--gold, solid, heavy, eminently portable. Perhaps steel cash-boxes with a chased design, on the covers; or perhaps a black and brass box with {{a handle on the}} top, and full of goodness knows what. Bank notes? Why not? The fellow had been going home; so it was surely something worth going home with.|$|E

30|$|For the superfine fibrous glass materials, the {{measured}} ETC. is agreeable with the calculated one when the <b>inside</b> air <b>pressure</b> {{is lower than}} 10 Pa and the ETC. value is around 3  mW/(m[*]·[*]K). As the <b>inside</b> air <b>pressure</b> exceeds 20  Pa and continues to rise, ETCs, both measured value and theoretical calculated one, sharply rise with the increasing of air pressure. And {{the difference between the}} two values also enlarges. One reason is that, the air molecules gathered in the pore leading to the thermal convection gradually intensified, as mentioned above. Another reason is that, the fibrous glass mate is flexible and compressible. The connected thermal resistance exists between two superfine fibrous pips and changes with the various air pressure differences between air <b>pressure</b> <b>inside</b> and outside the panels. The connected thermal resistance decreasing along with the <b>inside</b> air <b>pressure</b> increasing makes {{the measured}} ETC. value is slightly higher than that of calculated ones. So, the numerical ETC. prediction model for VIPs with the superfine fibrous glass core materials, is much accurate when the <b>inside</b> air <b>pressure</b> is lower than 10  Pa.|$|R

5000|$|A {{submarine}} hull has {{two major}} components, the light hull {{and the pressure}} hull. The light hull ("casing" [...] in British usage) of a submarine is the outer non-watertight hull which provides a hydrodynamically efficient shape. The pressure hull is the inner hull of a submarine that maintains structural integrity with the difference between outside and <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> at depth.|$|E
50|$|In the {{laboratory}} frame the polarization of a high-energy muon beam {{is limited to}} about 80% and its energy is {{of the order of}} ~40-50MeV. Although such a high energy beam requires the use of suitable moderators and samples with sufficient thickness, it guarantees a homogeneous implantation of the muons in the sample volume. Such beams are also used to study specimens inside of recipients, e.g. samples <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> cells.|$|E
5000|$|A {{champagne}} bottle holds {{a considerable amount}} of pressure. With early designs, bottles tended to explode and the manufacturers kept making them thicker until they could contain the pressure caused by the release of carbon dioxide during the secondary fermentation. The <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> of a typical {{champagne bottle}} is around [...] The diameter of the opening is 18 mm, so there is a force of about 160 N trying to push the cork out of the bottle.|$|E

50|$|The water {{pressure}} on the outer hatch is always greater than the air <b>pressure</b> <b>inside</b> the submarine, which prevents opening the hatch. Only when the <b>pressure</b> <b>inside</b> the escape chamber {{is equal to the}} sea pressure can the hatch be opened. Thus the compartment must be sealed off from the interior of the submarine and the <b>pressure</b> <b>inside</b> the chamber must be raised to sea pressure {{in order to make it}} possible to open the escape hatch.|$|R
50|$|Soap bubbles are {{physical}} {{examples of}} the complex mathematical problem of minimal surface. They will assume the shape of least surface area possible containing a given volume. A true minimal surface is more properly illustrated by a soap film, which has equal pressure on inside as outside, hence is a surface with zero mean curvature. A soap bubble is a closed soap film: due to the difference in outside and <b>inside</b> <b>pressure,</b> it is a surface of constant mean curvature.|$|E
5000|$|The air {{pressure}} inside the bulb needs {{to strike a}} balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for [...] "eddy currents" [...] to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can [...] "wrap around" [...] to the other side.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} ridge {{sometimes referred to}} as a tumulus (or tumuli in plural form) is created in an active lava flow. Formation occurs when the outer edges and surfaces of the lava flow begin to harden. If the advancing lava underneath becomes restricted it may push up on the hardened crust, tilting it outward. Inflation also takes place and is a process where the plastic layer of lava underneath expands as it cools and small crystals form. The end result is a raised mound of hardened lava rock, usually a relatively narrow but long ridge. Tension cracks form on the surface of {{pressure ridge}}s and run along the axis of elongated ridges, and at both edges of broader ridges, {{sometimes referred to as}} pressure plateaus. Sometimes, along the edges of a pressure ridge, the tension crack can be large enough to create a liftup cave. Other caves can form <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> ridges when the lava vacates leaving an inflationary cave.|$|E

40|$|We show using {{molecular}} dynamics simulation that spatial confinement of water inside carbon nanotubes (CNT) substantially increases its boiling temperature and that a small temperature growth above the boiling point dramatically raises the <b>inside</b> <b>pressure.</b> Capillary theory successfully predicts the boiling point elevation down to 2 nm, below which large deviations between the theory and atomistic simulation take place. Water behaves qualitatively different inside narrow CNTs, exhibiting transition into an unusual phase, where pressure is gas-like and grows linearly with temperature, while the diffusion constant is temperature-independent. Precise control over boiling by CNT diameter, together with {{the rapid growth of}} <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> above the boiling point, suggests a novel drug delivery protocol. Polar drug molecules are packaged inside CNTs; the latter are delivered into living tissues and heated by laser. Solvent boiling destroys CNT capping agents and releases the drug...|$|E

After a brief survey of some non-equilibrium aspects which are normally considered through empirical or semiempirical models, a computer program has been developed, adopting as input the experimental pressure trend measured <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> vessel. Then the main thermal hydraulic quantities involved in the blow-down transient are evaluated.

40|$|A {{circular}} {{steel pipe}} fined with water may be cracked immediately {{when the water}} becomes frozen. However, it is worth to note that a square pipe will not be cracked at the first time of repeated freezings due to the large bending deformation from square to circular in the cross section. The volumetric change, deformation, stress-strain, inside temperature and <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> of the regular square steel pipe were measured during the repeated freezing tests, and the data was numerically analyzed. The obtained results are as follows. 1) The regular square steel pipes can be durable {{for the second time}} of the repeated freezing tests with large plastic deformation as well as elastic. All the test pieces are cracked by the corner edges of the cross section and failed at the third test. 2) While repeating the freezing tests for the same pipe, the <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased, but the hoop strain is decreased reversely. 3) The assumption that deformed curves for the lateral cross section and for the longitudinal section are circular and quadratic respectively is almost appropriate for the real deformation of test pipes. The difference in the volumetric increment between the calculated and the measured equals 0. 4 ％ {{for the first time and}} 2. 3 ％ for the second time of the freezing tests...|$|E

The <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions of the model tower are almost constant in spite of variation of the ventilation height.

An existing free fall tower facility and the possibility of adding inside the falling elevator cabin an air tight, sealed, cylindrical container with <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> or = - 0. 001 Torr were examined to test the gradiometer in free fall conditions inside this evacuated container.

It is concluded that the free fall testing of the gradiometer is both feasible and practical...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMaterial {{properties}} of Zr 2. 5 wt% Nb pressure tube change during reactor operation {{due to the}} surrounding environmental conditions. Measurement of mechanical {{properties of}} the pressure tubes is important for assessing their fitness for service. As it is required to remove a pressure tube from service to prepare specimens for doing the property measurement in laboratory, any in-situ technique has great significance. Considering this, an In-situ Property Measurement System (IProMS) based on cyclic ball indentation technique has been designed and developed in house. For qualification of IProMS a number of experimental trials have been carried out. One {{of the most important}} tests was to carry out IProMS trials inside spool pieces of Zr 2. 5 wt% Nb pressure tube with different mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{pressure}} vessel {{is one of}} a large number of plant components for which stress analyses must be performed. A {{pressure vessel}} experiences mainly two types of stresses, primary stresses and secondary stresses. Primary stresses are because of pressure <b>inside</b> <b>pressure</b> vessel and secondary stresses are because of thermal loading. Thermal loading is considerable in a pressure vessel which handles hot fluid. Typically liquid metal reactors (LMR) have thermo-mechanical loadings. Analytically, induced stresses are calculated using pressure vessel theory or ASME codes. In this project induced stresses are calculated using ANSYS coupled field analysis for thermo-mechanical loading. The results are then compared with analytical results. This work demonstrates usage of commercial FEA tool over analytical approach. Analytical solutions such as ASME and Japanese Code give empirical relationships to calculate thermal stress. Use of FEA tools is not very popular in pressure vessel industries. FEA of this kind of loading requires coupled field analysis. In the work ANSYS is used to perform coupled field analysis...|$|E
