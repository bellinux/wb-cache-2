5|$|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a 2005 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning American {{historian}} Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin,</b> {{published by}} Simon & Schuster. The {{book is a}} biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{and some of the}} men who served with him in his cabinet from 1861 to 1865. Three of his Cabinet members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election: Attorney General Edward Bates, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase and Secretary of State William H. Seward. The book focuses on Lincoln's mostly successful attempts to reconcile conflicting personalities and political factions on the path to abolition and victory in the American Civil War.|$|E

500|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} about Booth's motivations. In {{a letter to}} his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> has endorsed the idea that another factor was Wilkes' rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth, who was a loyal Unionist. David S. Reynolds believes Wilkes greatly admired the abolitionist John Brown; Wilkes' sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: [...] "John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!" ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appointed}} Marshall to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was [...] "the right thing to do, {{the right time to}} do it, the right man and the right place." [...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967. Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin,</b> that a lot of black baby boys would be named [...] "Thurgood" [...] in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).|$|E
500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin,</b> in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady {{you are and what}} I can hear is that you believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance." [...] Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Roosevelt mailed Rutherfurd {{a copy of}} {{his first}} public lecture after his [...] 1921 paralytic illness, privately {{dedicating}} it to her with an inscription. At his first memorable presidential inauguration on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt made arrangements for Rutherfurd to attend and witness his swearing-in. When her husband later suffered a stroke, she contacted Roosevelt to arrange for him to be cared for at well-regarded Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Historian/author Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> speculated that an entry in the White House ushers diary for August 1, 1941 included a code name for Lucy Rutherfurd, suggesting that she attended a private dinner with the president then. After her husband's death when the two began seeing each other more occasionally, Rutherfurd also arranged for her friend Elizabeth Shoumatoff, (1888–1980), a well-known artist, to paint Roosevelt's portrait.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the reasons}} that McClellan's {{reputation}} has suffered is his own memoirs. Historian Allan Nevins wrote, [...] "Students of history must always be grateful McClellan so frankly exposed his own weaknesses in this posthumous book." [...] Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> claims that a review of his personal correspondence during the war reveals a tendency for self-aggrandizement and unwarranted self-congratulation. His original draft was completed in 1881, but the only copy was destroyed by fire. He began to write another draft of what would be published posthumously, in 1887, as McClellan's Own Story. However, he died before it was half completed and his literary executor, William C. Prime, editor of the pro-McClellan New York Journal of Commerce, included excerpts from some 250 of McClellan's wartime letters to his wife, in which it had been his habit to reveal his innermost feelings and opinions in unbridled fashion.|$|E
500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin,</b> [...] "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of whether LeHand and Roosevelt's relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries {{and continues to be}} debated by historians. Hazel Rowley argues that [...] "there is no doubt that Franklin's relationship with Missy was romantic", but notes the possibility that the relationship could not have been consummated due to FDR's disability. Roosevelt biographer Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> states that [...] "beneath the complexity, it is absolutely clear that Franklin was the love of Missy's life, and that he adored her and depended on her for affection and support as well as work". Doug Wead wrote in his work on the parents of presidents, The Raising of a President, [...] "Some Roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated. Eleanor and the children accepted the relationship, which speaks for its innocence. Sara [...] spoke favorably of Missy's family and upbringing. Years later, only Elliott, of all the children, would declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{major league}} debut brought {{an end to}} {{approximately}} sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation {{of the military in}} 1948. Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was [...] "a legend and a symbol in his own time", and that he [...] "challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration." [...] According to historian Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin,</b> Robinson's [...] "efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America... accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} or not Roosevelt had a sexual relationship with Hickok. It was known in the White House press corps at the time that Lorena Hickok was a lesbian. Scholars, including Lillian Faderman and Hazel Rowley, have asserted that there was a physical component to the relationship, while Hickok biographer Doris Faber has argued that the insinuative phrases have misled historians. Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> stated in her 1994 Pulitzer Prize–winning account of the Roosevelts that [...] "whether Hick and Eleanor went beyond kisses and hugs" [...] could not be determined with certainty. Roosevelt was close friends with several lesbian couples, such as Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, and Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read, suggesting that she understood lesbianism; Marie Souvestre, Roosevelt's childhood teacher and a great influence on her later thinking, was also a lesbian. Faber published some of Roosevelt and Hickok's correspondence in 1980, but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an [...] "unusually belated schoolgirl crush" [...] and warned historians not to be misled. Researcher Leila J. Rupp criticized Faber's argument, calling her book [...] "a case study in homophobia" [...] and arguing that Faber unwittingly presented [...] "page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two women". In 1992, Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook argued that the relationship was in fact romantic, generating national attention. A 2011 essay by Russell Baker reviewing two new Roosevelt biographies in the New York Times Review of Books (Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage, by Hazel Rowley, and Eleanor Roosevelt: Transformative First Lady, by Maurine H. Beasley) stated, [...] "That the Hickok relationship was indeed erotic now seems beyond dispute considering what is known about the letters they exchanged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin</b> {{was struck}} by the emotion that the usually {{self-controlled}} Obama showed during the speech.

2500|$|... "The {{audience}} went wild, {{laughing and}} cheering {{and calling for}} more," [...] wrote historian Doris <b>Kearns</b> <b>Goodwin.</b> [...] "And the laughter carried beyond the banquet hall; it reverberated in living rooms and kitchens throughout the country, where people were listening to the speech on their radios. The Fala bit was so funny, one reporter observed, that 'even the stoniest of Republican faces cracked a smile.'" ...|$|E
