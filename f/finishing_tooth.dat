40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{combination}} of tooth flank hardness and tooth surface roughness on the surface durability of medium-hardness gears are investigated using a disk machine. The meaning {{of the difference in}} hardness between a pair of gears is discussed. In the case where the surface roughnesses differ between contact surfaces with the same initial hardness, severe wear and pitting occur on the smooth surface because the asperities on the rough surface are highly hardeneddue to the repetition of contact. Therefore, it is necessary that the initial hardness of the smooth surface is higher than that of the rough surface in a combination of different sufface roughnesses.

40|$|Objectives The aims of this {{investigation}} were to clarify the effects of 24 h water-storage and finishing time on mechanical properties and marginal adaptation to a Class V cavity of eight modern flowable resin-composites. Methods Eight flowable composites, plus two controls (one microfilled and one hybrid composite), were investigated with specimen sub-groups (n = 10) for each property measured. The principal series of experiments was conducted in model Class V cavities with interfacial polishing either immediately (3 min) after setting or after 24 h water-storage. After the <b>finishing</b> procedure, each <b>tooth</b> was sectioned in a buccolingual direction {{through the center of}} the restoration, and the presence or absence of marginal-gaps was measured (and then summed for each cavity) at 14 points (each 0. 5 mm apart) along the cavity restoration interface (n = 10 per group; total points measured = 140). The shear bond-strengths to enamel and to dentin, and flexural strengths and moduli data were also measured at 3 min and after 24 h water-storage. Results For all flowable composites, polished immediately after setting, 14 – 30 summed gaps were observed (controls: 64 and 42). For specimens polished after 24 h, a significantly (p &# 60; 0. 05) reduced number of 8 – 17 summed gaps occurred for only 3 flowable composites; whereas for 5 flowable composites there were non-significantly-different (p &# 62; 0. 05) numbers (11 – 17) of summed gaps (controls: 28 and 22). After 24 h storage, shear bond-strengths to enamel and to dentin, flexural strengths and moduli increased highly significantly (p &# 60; 0. 001) for all materials, except Silux Plus.

Unlike living species, fossil hyracoids simultaneously possess replaced P 1 and canine teeth. Fossil species also have shorter crowns, an {{upper and lower}} I 3 locus, an upper I 2, and a hypoconulid on m 3. Prenatal specimens of the living Procavia capensis and Heterohyrax brucei show up to three tooth buds posterior to upper dI 1 and anterior to the seven upper cheek teeth that consistently erupt; these include an anterior premolar but not a canine. Most lower cheek <b>teeth</b> <b>finish</b> eruption during growth in hyracoids, not after growth as in most other afrotherians. All hyracoids show the m 1 at (lower) or near (upper) the beginning of eruption of permanent teeth; M 3 /m 3 is the last permanent tooth to erupt. The living P. capensis erupts most lower antemolar loci before m 2. In contrast, fossil hyraxes erupt lower antemolars after m 2. While the early eruption of antemolars correlates with increased gestation time and age at maturity in primates and Tupaia (i. e., "Schultz's Rule"), and while modern hyraxes resemble some anthropoid primates in exhibiting long gestation and eruption of antemolars at or before molars, eruption patterns do not significantly co-vary with either life history parameter among afrotherians sampled so far.

40|$|AIM Two {{prospective}} {{clinical studies}} were conducted, aiming to asses the color alterations of natural teeth associated with fixed orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS & METHODS Twenty six started and 48 finished consecutively selected orthodontic patients comprised {{the two different}} samples of the studies, respectively. In the first group (26 patients), the fixed appliances were bonded with two different adhesives (a chemicallycured and a light-cured resin), and the spectrophotometric color data of teeth were recorded in vivo prior to and following active orthodontic treatment. In the second group (48 patients), the removal of residual adhesive was performed with two different rotary instruments (low and high rotation speed), and the color measurements were made during three time intervals: after debonding and cleaning procedures, three months later (prior to and following finishing with discs), and one year after debonding. In both studies, the split-mouth design technique was employed. The reflectance spectrophotometer SpectroShade™ (MHT Optic Research AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for objective tooth color assessment in vivo. The CIE color parameters (L*, a*, b*) were measured for each tooth, and the corresponding color differences between the interval groups were calculated according to the equation ΔΕ = [(ΔL*) 2 + (Δa*) 2 + (Δb*) 2] 1 / 2. The effect of adhesive material, removal method, <b>finishing,</b> type of <b>teeth,</b> and their interaction on color was assessed with 3 -Way Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the comparisons of the main effects of the factors were performed with Bonferroni’s test (a< 0. 05). RESULTS The results indicate that orthodontic treatment influences CIE color parameters of natural teeth, since the L* values (lightness) decreased (p< 0. 001), while the a* and b* values (hue and chroma) increased (p< 0. 001) {{at the end of}} the active therapy as well as during the retention phase. Conversely, finishing restored temporarily the enamel appearance as indicated by the increase of L* and decrease of a* and b* color parameters. Following active orthodontic treatment, all measured types of teeth demonstrated significant color changes (ΔΕ), considering that their mean differences ranged from 2. 12 to 3. 61 ΔΕ-units. Additionally, the chemically-cured resin exhibited larger color changes than the light-cured composite (p< 0. 05), indicating different response to color stability. During the first retention year, the mean color differences ranged from 1. 48 to 2. 11 ΔΕ-units with minor variation among the types of teeth. The comparison between the resin removal methods and the time intervals with respect to ΔΕ, revealed that the larger color changes exhibited during the first three months with the high-speed rotary instrument. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that, color of natural teeth during active and retention phase of orthodontic treatment changes in various ways. This outcome may be caused by the dental and pulp tissue alterations related to orthodontic tooth movement, the irreversible nature of microstructural enamel modifications associated with bonding, debonding and cleaning procedures, as well as the discoloration of the remaining adhesive material. ...|$|R

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the marginal adaptation and microleakage along enamel and dentin margins produced by a low -shrinkage composite restorative material as compared to a micro-hybrid composite resin,each provided with its adhesive system. It was also the aim of this study to evaluate the effect of thermal stresses, using two different cycles, on marginal adaptation and microleakage of such materials and to detect any correlation between them at occlusal enamel and gingival dentin walls. Materials and Methods: Forty freshly extracted premolars were selected for use in this investigation. Class V cavities (2 mm diameter and 2 mm depth) were prepared on the buccal and lingual aspects of each tooth. The gingival margin in dentin of each cavity was prepared 1 mm beyond the cemento-enamel junction, while the occlusal margin was prepared 1 mm above it. Prepared teeth were randomly divided into four groups of ten teeth each; in Groups 1 and 3 Filtek Z 250 restorative material was used to restore cavities whereas Filtek P 90 restorative material was used to restore cavities in Groups 2 and 4. After <b>finishing</b> and polishing, <b>teeth</b> in Groups 1 and 2 were thermocycled for 1500 times while teeth in Groups 3 and 4 were thermocycled for 3000 times. Epoxy replicas were made for marginal adaptation analysis in SEM. For microleakage test, specimens were stained using methylene blue, sectioned and evaluated for depth of dye penetration using 0 - 4 scoring system. The data of marginal adaptation were analyzed using Two-way analysis of variance and Student’s t-test while the data of microleakage were analyzed using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, post Hoc and Fisher’s exact tests. Spearman rank correlation was used to quantify the possible correlation between marginal adaptation and microleakage values. Results: At occlusal enamel margin, the mean values of the largest gap in Groups 2 and 4 were significantly higher than those in Groups 1 and 3, while the mean values of the largest gingival dentin gap in Groups 1 and 3 were significantly higher than those in Groups 2 and 4. The mean largest dentin gap was found to be significantly higher than that of enamel in Groups 1 and 3. Microleakage at occlusal enamel walls showed significantly higher mean ranks in Groups 2 and 4 than that in Groups 1 and 3. Groups 1 and 3 demonstrated significantly higher mean ranks of microleakage at gingival dentin walls when compared to those in Groups 2 and 4. Moderate to severe microleakage was recorded at gingival dentin walls, while no or slight leakage was detected at occlusal enamel walls in Groups 1 and 3. A different trend was observed for Groups 2 and 4 where they showed moderate to severe microleakage at occlusal enamel walls, and no or slight leakage at gingival dentin walls. No evident relation between an increased number of thermal cycles and either gap formation or microleakage was observed. No significant correlation between marginal adaptation and microleakage at both occlusal enamel and gingival dentin walls was found. Conclusions: The results of this study show that none of the restorative materials used is capable of perfectly adapting to the margins or completely sealing the cavity. P 90 system adhesive bond/low-shrinkage silorane-based composite Filtek P 90 demonstrated smaller marginal gap and less microleakage along gingival dentin margin while Adper Tm single bond 2 /microhybrid methacrylate-based composite Filtek Z 250 showed smaller marginal gap and less microleakage along occlusal enamel margin. When comparing enamel to dentin margins of the same restorative material, P 90 system adhesive bond/ low shrinkage silorane-based composite Filtek P 90 demonstrated less microleakage along gingival dentin margin, whereas Adper Tm single bond 2 /microhybrid methacrylate-based composite Filtek Z 250 showed smaller marginal gap and less microleakage along occlusal enamel margin. Different thermal cycles did not affect both marginal adaptation and microleakage. No correlation was found between marginal adaptation and microleakage at occlusal enamel and gingival dentin walls...|$|R
