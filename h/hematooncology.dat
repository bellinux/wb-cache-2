40|$|Thesis {{is focused}} on aspects of nursing care in a child <b>hematooncology</b> {{and their impact on}} nurses. Cancer by {{children}} in the Czech Republic are the second leading cause of death in childhood. The incidence of childhood cancer has increased {{at the beginning of the}} second half of last century by about 1 % per year, but since the late 80 years is no longer apparent increase in incidence. Tumors in children most often arise in hematopoietic tissue and ranks at the top of the various types of tumors in children. The work is divided into two parts, theoretical and practical. The theoretical part describes the problems in each chapter <b>hematooncology</b> children, hospitalized child and his needs, the role of nurses, mental and physical workload, burnout and mental hygiene. The practical part was the task of verifying three goals. The first objective was to find out the specifics of children's nurses work <b>hematooncology.</b> The second objective was to find out what demands are made for nurses working in child <b>hematooncology.</b> The third objective was to find out how nurses working in this department handle mental stress. To achieve the objective method was used qualitative research project, in the form of two half standardized interview and standardized questionnaires. The research sample consisted of thirteen nurses working on the unit hematoonklogie children. Of which there were three sisters from České Budějovice Hospital, two nurses from University Hospital Motol in Prague, five sisters from the University Hospital Brno and three nurses from University Hospital Olomouc. It emerged from research that nurses consider the work of the department for children <b>hematooncology</b> very professional. The specifics of their department nurses find different ways. The greatest majority of respondents consider the specifics of the presence of parents in the nursing department, long-term hospitalization of children and work with cytostatics. Demands on the work of nurses according to their testimony are significant. Their work places increased demands on the skills and manual dexterity. They consider the greatest burden as the psychological burden, especially in the care of a child with end stage, and his subsequent death. The interviews revealed that most nurses in the department are satisfied. They consider their work is very diverse and specific. The output of the thesis will be creating a Power Point presentation (Annax n. 7) that will be used as presentation material at the Fifth International Conference on Present and Future of Nursing and Midwifery, which will be held on 6 - 7 September 2012 in the České Budějovice. It is planned to make these materials and technical paper subsequently published in peer-reviewed medical journal with the theme...|$|E
3000|$|To find a {{relationship}} between clinical and sonographic appearance of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in pediatric <b>hematooncology</b> patients. Clinical and sonographic findings of 31 children (M:F =  18 : 13; mean age, 12.7  years) with HC in pediatric <b>hematooncology</b> patients were reviewed. For each patient, the onset of HC after transplantation, use of bladder-toxic agent, presence of BK viruria, and duration of disease were reviewed. Sonographic findings including bladder wall thickness (BWT), the type of bladder wall thickening (nodular vs. diffuse), occurrence of hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis were reviewed. We analyzed sonographic appearance and clinical manifestations of HC. HC occurred within 4  months after HSCT/BMT. 27 patients (87.0  %) were positive for BK viruria and 24 patients (77.4  %) took bladder-toxic agents. On sonography, nodular type bladder wall thickening was more frequent (54.8  %), and BWT was thicker in this group (p =  0.003). There was {{a positive correlation between}} the BWT on initial sonography and duration of cystitis (r [...]...|$|E

40|$|Recently novel {{treatment}} modalities {{has focused}} on targeted therapies. Tyrosine kinases represent a good target for cancer treatment since {{they are involved in}} transferring phosphate groups from ATP to tyrosine residues in specific substrate proteins transducing intracellular signals engaged in the many mechanisms, playing {{an important role in the}} modulation of growth factors signaling that are strongly related to carcinogenesis. Deregulation of tyrosine kinases activity was also found in hematological malignancies, particularly overexpression of tyrosine kinases was observed in chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Herein we show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized hematology malignancies therapy in a very short period of time and they still remain one of the most interesting anticancer compounds that could give a hope for cure and not only long-lasting complete remission. This manuscript summarizes current view on the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibititor – imatinib, second generation – dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutnib as well as new generation tyrosine kinase inhibititors – ponatinib and danusertib in <b>hematooncology...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of oxidative potential and activity of antioxidants on the course and chemotherapy response in acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemias. Material and methodsTwelve adult patients (7 women, 5 men) with acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia treated at the Department of <b>Hematooncology</b> University Medical School in Lublin, were studied. Plasma concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined using fluorimetric assay. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (PGx) were assesed in the whole blood using colorimetric assay with Randox reagents. ResultsThe overall survival in the group of patients with a low activity of GPx (< 5. 0 U/ml) was significantly longer than that in patients with a high activity of GPx (15. 71 ± 9. 8 vs 5. 8 ± 3. 68 month). Patients with hepatosplenomegaly were characterized by a significantly lower activity of SOD (52. 0 U/ml) compared to patients without hepatosplenomegaly (95. 12 U/ml). ConclusionThe state of the new balance between different defence mechanisms of an oxidation-reduction system, resulting from the presence of acute proliferation, may modulate the course of acute leukaemias and influence the response to chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) with inv(3) (q 21 q 26. 2) /t(3; 3) (q 21; q 26. 2) inv(3) /t(3; 3) ] is {{recognized}} as a distinctive entity in the WHO classification. Risk assignment and clinical and genetic characterization of AML with chromosome 3 q abnormalities other than inv(3) /t(3; 3) remain largely unresolved. Patients and Methods Cytogenetics, molecular genetics, therapy response, and outcome analysis were performed in 6, 515 newly diagnosed adult AML patients. Patients were treated on Dutch-Belgian <b>HematoOncology</b> Cooperative Group/Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON/SAKK; n = 3, 501) and German-Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group (AMLSG; n = 3, 014) protocols. EVI 1 and MDS 1 /EVI 1 expression was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results 3 q abnormalities were detected in 4. 4 % of AML patients (288 of 6, 515). Four distinct groups were defined: A: inv(3) /t(3; 3), 32 %; B: balanced t(3 q 26), 18 %; C: balanced t(3 q 21), 7 %; and D: other 3 q abnormalities, 43 %. Monosomy 7 {{was the most common}} additional aberration in groups (A), 66 %; (B), 31 %; and (D), 37 %. N-RAS mutations and dissociate EVI 1 versus MDS 1 /EVI 1 overexpression were associated with inv(3) /t(3; 3). Patients with inv(3) /t(3; 3) and balanced t(3 q 21) at diagnosis presented with higher WBC and platelet counts. In multivariable analysis, only inv(3) /t(3; 3), but not t(3 q 26) and t(3 q 21), predicted reduced relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 99; P Conclusion Various categories of 3 q abnormalities in AML can be distinguished according to their clinical, hematologic, and genetic features.

40|$|This article {{represents}} a review and a detail {{analysis of the}} first phase of multidisciplinary work with parents of children and adolescents suffering from malignant diseases who were subjected to combination of oncology treatment at the pediatric oncology wards in Serbia, starting from January 2011 until June 2012. Project of NURDOR 'A cup of conversation' is a program of psychosocial multidisciplinary and educational support to parents of children and young people who are suffering from various malignant diseases during the course of their treatment at the pediatric hematology-oncology departments. In a series of lectures - composed of 6 workshops, lecturers are experts from various fields: doctor, psychologist, nurse, nutritionist and social worker as well as one parent whose child was cured. The program was implemented in two phases. In the first phase, (duration from January 2011 until June 2011) program was implemented only at two wards, at the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (hereinafter IORS) in Belgrade and the Department of hemato-oncology, University Pediatric Hospital in Belgrade (hereinafter UPH). In {{the first phase of}} the project there were 48 thematic workshops and we worked with a total of 195 parents. According to statistical analysis of evaluation forms that were filled out after each workshop anonymously by the parents - participants, the average cumulative score of all workshops was excellent (4. 84). In the second phase of the project (duration from November 2011 until June 2012) program of multidisciplinary workshops was expanded and organized into departments and pediatric <b>hematooncology</b> children's hospitals in the cities of Novi Sad and Niš. In the second phase a total of 104 workshops held and 505 parents were included. Average cumulative score of all worshops was 4. 84...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{health care}} {{scenario}} in India is experiencing {{an increase in}} the number of children affected with cancer and the number of pediatric oncologists available to treat these children are few and the awareness of childhood cancer is decimally low. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the attitude of post-graduate students of general pediatrics towards childhood cancer and to assess their interest in pursuing pediatric oncology as a specialty in their carrier. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted among 188 post-graduates hailing from various Medical colleges all over South India who were attending a 2 day workshop at Chennai. The survey was a 10 point questionnaire pertaining to their previous training, competence, interest toward the field of <b>hematooncology.</b> The data were analyzed by SPSS 18. V software. Results: Among the post-graduates, 74. 7 % of them reported that they did not have a pediatric oncology unit in their institution. 63. 3 % reported that they never been posted in pediatric oncology clinical postings before. 62 % were not interested in pursuing pediatric oncology as a sub-specialty at all. 45. 3 % felt that pediatric oncology was too depressing to take as a specialty. 46. 7 % felt that late diagnosis and referral was the main factor which contributed to the failure of effective treatment of childhood cancers. 52. 7 % had never attended a class on pediatric oncology. 61. 3 % felt that they did not have sufficient knowledge to suspect and refer a child with cancer. 92 % felt that there was a need to improve pediatric oncology teaching in their curriculum. 56. 7 % felt that the best way to imprint awareness on childhood malignancies was to improve pediatric oncology teaching in their medical curriculum. Conclusion: The results show that majority of post-graduates in pediatrics were not interested in pursuing pediatric oncology as a sub-specialty. The main reasons may be lack of specialized Pediatric oncology units in the majority of the medical institutions, lack of opportunity of these post-graduates to attend clinical postings and theory classes. They thus lack sufficient information in this field and hence do not want to take up a career in pediatric oncology...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{multiple}} myeloma (MM) treated with conventional chemotherapy {{have an average}} survival of approximately three years. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), first introduced in the mid- 1980 s, is now considered the standard therapy for almost all patients {{with multiple}} myeloma, because it prolongs overall survival and disease free survival. Between November 1997 and October 2006, 122 patients with MM (58 females, 64 males, median age 51. 0 years [&# 177; 7. 98] range: 30 &# 8211; 66 years) were transplanted in the Department of <b>Hematooncology</b> and Bone Marrow Transplantation at the Medical University of Lublin: 47 patients were in complete remission or in unconfirmed complete remission, 66 patients were in partial remission, and nine had stable disease. Of these, there were 95 patients with IgG myeloma, 16 with IgA myeloma, one with IgG/IgA, one with IgM myeloma, five with non secretory type, two with solitary tumor and two with LCD myeloma. According to Durie-Salmon, 62 patients had stage III of the disease, 46 had stage II and four had stage I. Most patients (69 / 122) were transplanted after two or more cycles of chemotherapy, 48 patients were transplanted after one cycle of chemotherapy, one patient after surgery and rtg- -therapy and four patients had not been treated. In mobilisation procedure, the patients received a single infusion of cyclophosphamide (4 &# 8211; 6 g/m 2 ) or etoposide 1. 6 g/m 2 followed by daily administration of G-CSF until the peripheral stem cells harvest. The number of median harvest sessions was 2. 0 (&# 177; 0. 89) (range: 1 &# 8211; 5). An average of 7. 09 (&# 177; 33. 28) × 106 CD 34 + cells/kg were collected from each patient (range: 1. 8 &# 8211; 111. 0 × 106 /kg). Conditioning regimen consisted of high dose melphalan 60 &# 8211; 210 mg/m 2 without TBI. An average of 3. 04 (&# 177; 11. 59) × 106 CD 34 + cells/kg were transplanted to each patient. Fatal complications occured in four patients (treatment- -related mortality = 3. 2 %). In all patients there was regeneration of hematopoiesis. The median number of days for recovery to ANC > 0. 5 × 10 9 /l was 13 (&# 177; 4. 69) (range: 10 &# 8211; 38) and platelets recovery to > 50 × 10 9 /l was 25 days (&# 177; 11. 65) (range: 12 &# 8211; 45). Median time of hospitalization was 22 days (&# 177; 7. 14) (range: 14 &# 8211; 50). Patients were evaluated on day 100 after transplantation: 74. 9 % achieved CR and nCR, 14. 3 % were in PR, 5. 4 % had SD and 5. 4 % had progressed. Median of OS was 45 months (&# 177; 30. 67). OS at 3 -years was 84 % and at 7 -years 59 %. Median PFS was 25 months (&# 177; 26. 13). PFS at 3 -years was 68 %, and at 7 -years was 43 %. At present (November 2009) 52 patients (42 %) are still alive. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is a valuable, well tolerated method of treatment for patients with MM that allows the achievement of long- -lasting survival.
