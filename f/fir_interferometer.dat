40|$|A Co_ 2 laser based {{diagnostics}} complimentary to {{the existing}} <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer</b> is proposed. It combines interferometry for plasma density profile measurement under conditions of large density gradients, and both imaging and scattering techniques for observation of plasma fluctuations. Two-colour interferometer with a slab-like probe beam and a single multichannel linear detector array provide observation of plasma density profile and density fluctuations at two locations along the probe beam. Basic characteristics of the diagnostics are considered {{as well as some}} effects that include dispersion and are critical for two colour imaging technique. The results of the bench-top experiments with the prototype of the interferometer are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) {{instrument}} {{flying on}} the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn is a cryogenic spectrometer with far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) channels. The CIRS FIR channel is a polarizing interferometer that contains three polarizing grid components. These components are an input polarizer, a polarizing beamsplitter, and an output polarizer/analyzer. They {{consist of a}} 1. 5 micron thick mylar substrate with 2 gm wide copper wires, with 2 gm spacing (4 micron pitch) photolithographically deposited on the substrate. This paper details the polarization sensitivity studies performed on the output polarizer/analyzer, and the alignment sensitivity studies performed on the input polarizer and beamsplitter components in the <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} prototype spectral/spatial interferometer {{has been}} constructed {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of the double Fourier technique at Far Infrared (FIR) wavelengths (0. 15 - 1 THz). It is planned to use this demonstrator to investigate and validate important design features and data processing methods for future astronomical <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer</b> instruments. In building this prototype {{we have had to}} address several key technologies to provide an end-end system demonstration of this double Fourier interferometer. We report on the first results taken when viewing single slit and double slit sources at the focus of a large collimator used to simulate real sources at infinity. The performance of the prototype instrument for these specific field geometries is analyzed to compare with the observed interferometric fringes and to demonstrate image reconstruction capabilities.

40|$|Many {{studies on}} the {{formation}} of stars and planets require high angular and high spectral resolution in the far-infrared regime. Even with the upcoming operation of the Herschel Space Observatory, ALMA, and JWST, angular resolutions of better than 1 arcsec combined with high spectral resolution in the crucial far-infrared domain of 1 THz to similar to 10 THz (300 mu m to 30 mu m) are still beyond observational reach. Only a far-infrared heterodyne interferometer can close this gap. Here we present the general requirements for a <b>FIR</b> heterodyne <b>interferometer</b> in space and address a number of critical key technologies needed for such an instrument...|$|R
40|$|A new two color far {{infrared}} (<b>FIR)</b> laser <b>interferometer</b> under development for future fusion devices will be presented. The laser wavelength is optimized from {{the consideration of}} the beam refraction effect due to plasma density gradient and signal-to-noise ratio for an expected phase shift due to plasmas. Laser lines of 57. 2 and 47. 6 ?m {{are found to be}} suitable for the applications to high performance plasmas of Large Helical Device and future fusion devices such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The output power of 57. 2 ?m CH_ 3 OD laser is estimated to be ~ 1. 6 W, which is the highest laser power in the FIR wavelength regime. The optical configuration of a new interferometer system using two colors will be proposed. In the system, one detector simultaneously detects the beat signals of the 57. 2 and 47. 6 ?m laser lines, and each interference signal can be separated electronically (1 MHz for 57. 2 ?m and 0. 84 MHz expected for 47. 6 ?m). Mechanical vibration can be compensated by using the two color interferometer. The present status of the development of the system is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) {{instrument}} on the Cassini Mission {{launched in}} October of 1997. The CIRS instrument contains a mid-infrared (MIR) and a far-infrared <b>interferometer</b> (<b>FIR)</b> and operates at 170 Kelvin. The MIR is a Michelson Fourier transform spectrometer utilizing a 76 mm (3 inch) diameter potassium bromide beamsplitter and compensator pair. The potassium bromide elements were tested to verify effects of cooldown and vibration prior to {{integration into the}} instrument. The instrument was then aligned at ambient temperatures, tested cryogenically and re-verified after vibration. 'Me stringent design optical figure requirements for the beamsplitter and compensator included fabrication errors, mounting stresses and vibration load effects. This paper describes the challenges encountered in mounting the elements to minimize distortion and to survive vibration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Simultaneous {{measurements}} of oscillations {{of the electron}} temperature, the electron density and the poloidal magnetic field in the Rijnhuizen Tokamak RTP are combined to obtain insight into the structure of MHD mode perturbations. Diagnostics used are a 20 channel heterodyne ECE radiometer, a 19 channel <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer,</b> {{and a set of}} magnetic pick-up coils. A m/n = 2 / 1 island preceding a disruption is analysed in detail. Whereas the density and temperature are significantly lower in the O-point than in the X-point, no local minimum or even flattening of the profiles could be demonstrated. The gradients across the island may be understood in terms of a very long connection length inside the island, in combination with the relatively short mean free path along the field lines due to the high collisionality in the outer region of the plasma. The transport inside the island and the poloidal distribution of the radial heat flux over X- and O-point are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{program of the}} Rijnhuizen Tokamak Project is concentrated {{on the study of}} plasma transport processes. The RTP tokamak is therefore equipped with an extensive set of multichannel diagnostics, including a 19 -channel <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer,</b> a 20 -channel heterodyne ECE system, an 80 -channel X-ray as well as an 80 -channel visible light tomography system and a 30 - to 60 -channel Thomson-scattering system. The diagnostic set will soon be extended with a 19 -channel FIR polarimeter, a 20 -channel heterodyne ECA system and a multichannel pulsed radar system. Important new insights in some plasma physical phenomena have been obtained by combining data measured simultaneously with the various diagnostics. Some examples will be briefly presented: the effect of localized ECR heating on the electron density, the observation of density and temperature gradients in m = 2 magnetic islands as well as evidence for purely conductive local cooling prior to the energy quench phase of major disruptions...|$|E

40|$|The {{particle}} transport characteristics {{have been}} investigated in the Large Helical Device (LHD) from the density modulation experiments. External gas puff modulation induces the perturbation of the electron density. The particle transport coefficients, which are diffuison coefficients (D) and convection velocity (V), were estimated from the fitting of the solution of perturbed particle transport equation with modeled D and V to the experimentally obtained modulation amplitude and phase. The difference of D and V between two different magnetic configurations, of which magnetic axis position (Rax) is 3. 6 m and 3. 75 m, were observed. More than factor two lower D are obtained at Rax= 3. 6 m than values ar Rax= 3. 75 m in the whole region of plasma. In the core region, no convection was obtained at p 0. 6 at Rax= 3. 6 m, p> 0. 8 at Rax= 3. 75 m), inward pinch was obtained at both configurations.

40|$|We are {{developing}} the super broad band interferometer {{by applying the}} Fourier Transform Spectrometer(FTS) to aperture synthesis system in mm and sub-mm bands. We have constructed a compact system based on the Martin and Puplett type Fourier Transform spectrometer (MP-FT). We call this equipment Multi-Fourier Transform interferometer (MuFT). The band width of the system can be extended as large as one wants contrary to the severely limited band width of the usual interferometer due to {{the speed of the}} AD converter. The direct detectors, e. g. bolometer, SIS video detector, can be used as the focal plane detectors. This type of detectors have a great advantage in FIR band since they are free from the quantum limit of the noise which limits the sensitivity of the heterodyne detectors used in the usual interferometers. Further, the direct detectors are able to make a large format array contrary to the heterodyne detectors for which construction of a large format array is practically difficult. These three characteristics make one be possible to develop high sensitive super broad band <b>FIR</b> <b>interferometer</b> with wide field of view. In the laboratory experiments, we have succeeded in measuring the spectroscopically resolved 2 D image of the source in 150 GHz- 900 GHz band. The future application of this technique to the observations from the space could open new interesting possibilities in FIR astronomy.
