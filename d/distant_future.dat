5|$|In the <b>distant</b> <b>future,</b> deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored by adults while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds the room to be a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who seems to know him.|$|E

The convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap, until the freezer's cooling system fails, causing Jasper to defrost and walk away.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the competitive firm under price uncer-tainty in general and the hedging role of futures spreads in particular. The firm has access to a commodity futures market where unbiased nearby and <b>distant</b> <b>futures</b> contracts are transacted. A liquidity constraint is imposed on the firm such that the firm is forced to prematurely close its <b>distant</b> <b>futures</b> position whenever the net interim loss due to its nearby and <b>distant</b> <b>futures</b> positions exceeds a threshold level. This paper shows that the liquidity constrained firm optimally opts for a long nearby futures position and a short <b>distant</b> <b>futures</b> position should the firm be prudent, thereby rendering the optimality of us-ing futures spreads for hedging purposes. This paper further shows that the firm’s production decision is adversely affected by the presence of the liquidity constraint. JEL classification: D 21; D 8...|$|R

5|$|Popotan {{takes place}} in the <b>distant</b> <b>future</b> within the {{remnants}} of Tokyo, destroyed by a cataclysm and since altered by geological transformations. The disaster was caused by a giant dandelion structure resembling a spire that arose in the city atop a hill. The main location of the game is a European-style mansion, seen as completely out-of-place in the city. Much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town meeting characters and triggering event sequences.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the <b>distant</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the <b>distant</b> <b>future.</b> Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E

To minimize transition costs and to ensure the viability of modern regulatory instruments like yardstick competition, {{it is important to}} acknowledge the historical industry structure and market developments. Likewise it is important to plan regulatory trajectories for the immediate and more <b>distant</b> <b>futures.</b> In this position paper, we stress the delicate nature of regulation and in particular the evolutionary context of regulation, where even the yardstick competition is seen as a transition step from simple CPI-X revenue caps towards pseudo-contestable markets...|$|R
5|$|Gameplay in Popotan {{follows a}} semi-predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but {{personal}} storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near {{the ruins of}} Tokyo in the <b>distant</b> <b>future.</b> The player's {{goal is to make}} available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls.

In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E

The main reason to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions is a concern for faraway lands (Schelling 2000), <b>distant</b> <b>futures</b> (Nordhaus 1982), and remote probabilities (Weitzman 2009). The people who emit most are least affected by climate change, {{and the benefits of}} their abatement would be diffused. Carbon dioxide dwells in the atmosphere for decades and the effects on temperature and sea level play out over even longer periods. On central projections climate change and its impacts are a nuisance for rich countries and a problem for poor countries. But there is a chance that things will go horribly wrong.

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far <b>distant</b> <b>future,</b> making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E

Chrono Trigger was ported to the PlayStation in 1999 as a standalone title in Japan and in 2001 as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation in North America. A third version was released for the Nintendo DS handheld platform on November 20, 2008. It is regarded today {{as one of the greatest}} games ever made.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of fictions within the design field are not disinterested speculations about <b>distant</b> <b>futures,</b> but intentional political {{actions in the}} present time. Fictions can entertain as much as cause social friction. This article discusses three sources of design fictions: a global information technology company; an art school in the UK; and a design institute in Brazil. By contrasting the three cases {{in light of the}} philosophical work of Álvaro Vieira Pinto, this article deconstructs the ideology of the future—futurology—and proposes acting in the present—handiness—to sketch an ideology of liberation. Instead of supporting the status quo, such ideology could inspire collective action for change.

5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the <b>distant</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
5|$|Laurie was {{supposed}} to wear a monocle as Lt. George, the character's second incarnation, but eventually decided against it after it kept falling out of his eye.

Although no new series or specials were made, the creators of the series have commented on various proposals over the years; one possibility was a film in which the main characters return as a 1960s' rock band, with George playing the guitar and keyboard.

5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the <b>distant</b> <b>future.</b> The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E

We then explore the influence of the time horizon in the expected utility model.
