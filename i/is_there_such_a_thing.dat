He was heavily involved in the discussions within WMO in 1978 that eventually led to the first World Climate Conference being held in Geneva in 1979.

2500|$|Zangwill {{is known}} {{incorrectly}} for inventing the slogan [...] "A land without a {{people for a}} people without a land" [...] describing Zionist aspirations in the Biblical land of Israel. He did not invent the phrase; he acknowledged borrowing it from Lord Shaftesbury. In 1853, during the preparation for the Crimean War, Shaftesbury wrote to Foreign Minister Aberdeen that Greater Syria was [...] "a country without a nation" [...] in need of [...] "a nation without a country... <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing?</b> To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!" [...] In his diary that year he wrote [...] "these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now in his wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country."

2500|$|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, in July 1853, who was President of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews {{wrote to}} Prime Minister Aberdeen that Greater Syria was [...] "a country without a nation" [...] {{in need of}} [...] "a nation without a country... <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing?</b> To be sure there is, the ancient and {{rightful}} lords of the soil, the Jews!" [...] In May of the following year, {{he wrote in his}} diary [...] "Syria is 'wasted without an inhabitant'; these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now, in His wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country". In 1875, Shaftesbury told the annual general meeting of the Palestine Exploration Fund that [...] "We have there a land teeming with fertility and rich in history, but almost without an inhabitant – a country without a people, and look! scattered over the world, a people without a country".|$|E
2500|$|... "This begs many questions. First, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as 'the {{international}} community'? Do {{people in}} China, {{which accounts for}} {{a fifth of the}} world's population, and the Buddhists, who account for another fifth—among others—really want the U.S. and its client states to bomb the Serbs or Iraqis? And who exactly, and when, deputed the U.S. to act on behalf of this 'world community'? ... Secondly, can the blunt weapon of force, of whose use U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright boasted, balance conflicting and competing ethnic, religious, economic and political interactions over this wide and conflictive region? Can the U.S. raise the expectations of the Albanians and Slav Moslems without affronting Macedonians, Greeks, Italians, Bulgars and Croats, as well as Serbs? ... Thirdly, can force be a substitute for policy? It was a wise German who said that you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them. The same goes for gunships, the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy. Bomb and rocket once, and it has an effect. But if the victim survives, the second bout is less effective, because the victim is learning to cope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea {{of the power of the}} wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.

On the contrary, {{from the position}} in which I am born, still more from the impulse of my nature, I am desirous to fulfil them. I have meditated on them, I may say, even for years. But I cannot find that {{it is part of}} my duty to maintain the order of things, for I will not call it system, which at present prevails in our country. It {{seems to me that it}} cannot last, as nothing can endure, or ought to endure, that is not founded upon principle; and its principle I have not discovered. In nothing, whether it be religion, or government, or manners, sacred or political or social life, do I find faith; and if there be no faith, how can there be duty? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as religious truth? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as political right? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as social propriety? Are these facts, or are they mere phrases? And if they be facts, where are they likely to be found in England? Is truth in our Church? Why, then, do you support dissent? Who has the right to govern? The monarch? You have robbed him of his prerogative. The aristocracy? You confess to me that we exist by sufferance. The people? They themselves tell you that they are nullities. Every session of that Parliament in which you wish to introduce me, the method by which power is distributed is called in question, altered, patched up, and again impugned. As for our morals, tell me, is charity the supreme virtue, or the greatest of errors? Our social system ought to depend on a clear conception of this point. Our morals differ in different counties, in different towns, in different streets, even in different Acts of Parliament. What is moral in London is immoral in Montacute; what is crime among the multitude is only vice among the few.' ...|$|E
60|$|Our only {{conclusion}} is that the psychological conditions which begat the ancient narratives produce the new legends. These surprise us by the apparent good faith in marvel and myth of many otherwise credible narrators, and by the coincidence, accidental or designed, with old stories not generally familiar to the modern public. Do impostors and credulous persons deliberately 'get up' the subject in rare old books? Is there a method of imposture handed down by one generation of bad little girls to another? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as persistent identity of hallucination among the sane? This was Coleridge's theory, {{but it is not}} without difficulties. These questions are the present results of Comparative Psychological Research.|$|E

My daughter is little Anne--as I was. My friend's daughter is little Blanche--as she was.

Little does it signify to us, when the soul has departed, where this poor body lies, but we who are left behind would do all we can to show how we loved them. This is denied me, but it is God's hand that afflicts us, and I try to submit. Some day I may be able to visit the spot, and see where he lies, and erect a simple stone to his memory.

Do they think I cure them for the sake of their dirty pence? No, no; those that like gold, and jewels, and elephants to ride on, can have it all in the East, and I came away from there. Because why?
