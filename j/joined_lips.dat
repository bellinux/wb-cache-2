6000|$|The hero of {{the night}} was Chico Mpamba; he must have caused a jealous pang to shoot through many a {{masculine}} bosom. With bending waist, arms gracefully extended forwards, and fingers snapping louder than castanets; with {{the upper half of}} the body fixed as to a stake, and with the lower convulsive as a scotched snake, he advanced and retired by a complicated shuffle, keeping time with the tom-tom and jingling his brass anklets, which weighed at least three pounds, and which, by the by, lamed him for several days. But he was heroic as the singer who broke his collar-bone by the ut di petto. A peculiar accompaniment was a dulcet whistle with lips protruded; hence probably the fable of Pliny's Astomoi, and the Africans of Eudoxus, whose <b>joined</b> <b>lips</b> compelled them to eat a single grain at a time, and to drink through a cane before sherry-cobblers were known. Others joined him, dancing either vis-Ã -vis or by his side; and more than one girl, who could no longer endure being a wall-flower, glided into the ring and was received with a roar of applause. In the feminine performance the eyes are timidly bent upon the ground; the steps are shorter and daintier, and the ritrosa appears at once to shun and to entice her cavalier, who, thus repulsed and attracted, redoubles the exciting measure till the delight of the spectators knows no bounds. Old Gidi Mavunga flings off his upper garment, and with the fire of a youth of twenty enters the circle, where his performance is looked upon with respect, if not with admiration. Wilder and wilder waxeth the [...] "Devil's delight," [...] till even the bystanders, especially the women, though they keep their places in the outer circle, cannot restrain that wonderful movement of haunch and flank. I laughed till midnight, and left the dancers dancing still.|$|E
6000|$|Had {{it really}} come? Must he {{go back home}} with this murk on him; knowing that his brother was a confessed and branded murderer? He went quickly, to the half-drawn {{curtains}} and looked in. Against the wall he saw a bed, and those two in it. He recoiled in sheer amazement and relief. Asleep with curtains undrawn, lights left on? Asleep through all his knocking! They must both be drunk. The blood rushed up in his neck. Asleep! And rushing forward again, he called out: [...] "Larry!" [...] Then, with a gasp he went towards the bed. [...] "Larry!" [...] No answer! No movement! Seizing his brother's shoulder, he shook it violently. It felt cold. They were lying in each other's arms, breast to breast, lips to lips, their faces white in the light shining above the dressing-table. And such a shudder shook Keith {{that he had to}} grasp the brass rail above their heads. Then he bent down, and wetting his finger, placed it close to their <b>joined</b> <b>lips.</b> No two could ever swoon so utterly as that; not even a drunken sleep could be so fast. His wet finger felt not the faintest stir of air, nor was there any movement in the pulses of their hands. No breath! No life! The eyes of the girl were closed. How strangely innocent she looked! Larry's open eyes seemed to be gazing at her shut eyes; but Keith saw that they were sightless. With a sort of sob he drew down the lids. Then, by an impulse that he could never have explained, he laid a hand on his brother's head, and a hand on the girl's fair hair. The clothes had fallen down a little from her bare shoulder; he pulled them up, as if to keep her warm, and caught the glint of metal; a tiny gilt crucifix no longer than a thumbnail, on a thread of steel chain, had slipped down from her breast into the hollow of the arm which lay round Larry's neck. Keith buried it beneath the clothes and noticed an envelope pinned to the coverlet; bending down, he read: [...] "Please give this at once to the police.--LAURENCE DARRANT." [...] He thrust it into his pocket. Like elastic stretched beyond its uttermost, his reason, will, faculties of calculation and resolve snapped to within him. He thought with incredible swiftness: 'I must know nothing of this. I must go!' And, almost before he knew that he had moved, he was out again in the street.|$|E

The intermediate space on the base is marked with eight to ten impressed spiral striae. The interstices of the spirals are crossed by longitudinals, which are regular, fine, hair-like, but distinct and well parted. Their curve on the surface below the suture shows the old sinus. On the base they are radiating and are crowded and irregular, except round the umbilicus, where {{in the first two}} or three striae they are very sharp and distinct. On the upper whorls both the spirals and longitudinals are finer, but sharper, than on the last.|$|R

50|$|Sculpture: spiralsâAt the {{periphery}} is a sharp flange-like carina Above this, {{about one-third of}} the distance to the suture, is a second, almost equally strong and prominent, which forms a shoulder to the whorls. The space between this and the suture is divided pretty equally by two threads, the lower of which is feeble. On the upper whorls all of these are closely beaded, on the body whorl only the two highest are so. Below the carina is another remote strong thread, which meets the outer lip. Within it is another, not quite so strong nor so distan. Occupying the space from this to the middle are five flat close-set threads, followed by three rather more separated and roughly beaded threads. The innermost of which, like a twisted cable, forms a sort of columella with a chink between it and the sharp edge of the columellar region of the inner lip, and advances into a small tooth at the angle where it <b>joins</b> the outer <b>lip</b> on the base.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} {{consists of}} spirals with quasi unique net-like, finely incised rhombohedral patterns. A similar (but not identical) surface pattern appears in Homalopoma granuliferum Nomura & Hatai, 1940 (family Colloniidae). Close to the suture is {{a row of}} disconnected beads. Between this and the carina are three rows of appressed beads, of which the highest is the weakest. These four rows are parted from one another by furrows, {{each of which is}} a little broader than the thread above it. The carina also consists of a row of appressed beads. It is stronger than the other beads both in breadth and height, and the furrow above it is a little broader and deeper than the rest. On the base are seven rows of appressed beads of nearly equal width and distance from one another; the first <b>joins</b> the outer <b>lip,</b> the central row twines up the pillar. These rows of beads make their appearance on the second whorl, and on all the upper whorls more than on the body whorl. The carina is sharply expressed by a constriction above and below it.|$|R

50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 9 mm and 22 mm. The shell is broadly umbilicated and the spire has a {{depressed}} conoidal shape. It is sculptured with very fine, hardly visible spiral striae and is otherwise smooth. It is very shining, ashen-whitish, painted with light yellowish to light brown confluent flammules above and at the umbilicus. It is ornamented with waved zigzag and acutely angular light and dark brown streaks. The 5Â½ whorls are slightly convex, moderately sloping, separated by simple, deep-channeled sutures. The spire shows only here and there very faint traces of obsolete spiral striae. The broad body whorl convex above with small erect slightly angular nodules in three rows, the two rounded at the periphery, depressly convex at the base. The rather large and deep umbilicus is cylindrical. It is bordered on the outer edge by an obtuse angle, a second angle appearing a little way within the orifice. The space between the two angles is slightly flattened, numerous very distinct close-set plicae traverse this space, crossing the angles. The rather large, diagonal aperture is rounded-trapezoidal. The thin, simple peristome is incomplete. The columellar margin is straightened, forming an obtuse angle where it <b>joins</b> the basal <b>lip.</b> The outer lip is sloping above, rounded at the base.The horny, concave operculum is thin with 6-7 whorls and has a raised lamina at the suture of the whorls.|$|R
50|$|The spire is {{high and}} conical. The apex broken. The 8 whorls (reckoning the first two as broken) show a slow and regular {{increase}} till the last, which enlarges rapidly. They are perfectly flat, with an upper and lower border, sharply angulated and carinated at the periphery, slightly convex but still very flat on the base, with a blunted angulated and carinated umbilical edge. The suture is linear, almost invisible, marginated above and below. The aperture is perpendicular, rhomboidal, with the columella and basal edges nearly equal, and the columella and outer lip nearly parallel. The outer lip is sharp and thin, not patulous, not descending, advancing at its junction with the body whorl, then retreating so as to form the broad open sinus, acute angled at the periphery, slightly arched across the base, nicked close {{to the point of}} the pillar. The columellar lip is arched, strengthened by a thin pad; reverted on the umbilicus so as to leave a slight groove behind it, it has a slight tooth in front. From the body whorl it bends very much over to the left, so as largely to cover the umbilicus, and then it curves over to the right to <b>join</b> the outer <b>lip</b> on the base at an obtuse angle. The umbilicus is small, oblique edged, funnel-shaped, nearly covered by the columellar lip, contracted within, scored with hair-like lines of growth.|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 38 mm and 64 mm. The {{imperforate}} shell has a conical shape. It is black or purplish-black. The 6 to 7 whorls are concave, longitudinally somewhat obliquely plicated. The plicae more or less project at the suture and {{on the edge of}} the basal whorl, producing an undulating or crenulated effect. Otherwise sculptured by incremental striae which traverse the surface and cross the plicae at right angles. The base of the shell is concave, radiately, closely and prominently striated, more conspicuous flattened, coalescing and sinuously curving at the edge. Commencing at the point where the outer <b>lip</b> <b>joins</b> the body whorl, a shallow groove follows parallel to the periphery and extends toward the aperture without interrupting the basal sculpture. The oblique aperture is subangulate, black-rimmed and crenulated on the thin edge of the outer lip. It is nacreous, silvery white toward the edge, bright lustrous golden yellow within and around the umbilical region, which latter though deeply pitted is not open. The white columella has a callus and is arcuated with a moderately developed rib bounding the umbilical depression and terminating in a single tubercle. This rib is paralleled by a shallow furrow terminating in a notch just below the tubercle, and by an exterior or outer ridge, part of the way double, of a brilliant orange color. This orange-colored rib is also exteriorly bounded by a shallow furrow that becomes obsolete toward the aperture. The base of the shell otherwise exhibits faint revolving sculpture.|$|R
