Cells grown on <b>formate</b> had 20 to 100 times higher methanogenesis rates on <b>formate</b> than cells grown on H 2 -CO 2 and transferred into <b>formate</b> medium.

40|$|Diauxic {{growth of}} Pseudomonas oxalaticus was {{observed}} on {{a mixture of}} <b>formate</b> and oxalate in batch cultures. In {{the first phase of}} growth only <b>formate</b> was used. The capacity to oxidize oxalate appeared during the lag phase of 2 - 4 h after the exhaustion of <b>formate</b> and was followed by a second phase of growth on oxalate. The rate of autotrophic 14 CO 2 fixation measured in washed cell suspensions decreased markedly in this second growth phase on the addition of oxalate. In mixtures of <b>formate</b> with acetate, glyoxylate or glycollate, simultaneous utilization of both substrates was observed. During growth on acetate plus <b>formate</b> formate-oxidizing capacity remained low. With low acetate concentrations, sufficient <b>formate</b> remained after the exhaustion of acetate to support a second growth phase on <b>formate.</b> This phase followed a 1. 5 - 2 h lag, during which formate-oxidizing capacity increased and the Calvin cycle enzymes were synthesized. In mixtures of <b>formate</b> with glyoxylate or glycollate, the formate-oxidizing capacity was high, <b>formate</b> was oxidized rapidly, and no second growth phase was seen. In these latter mixtures high activities of a membrane-bound, phenazine methosulphate/ 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase and low activities of the soluble NAD-linked <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase were detected.
