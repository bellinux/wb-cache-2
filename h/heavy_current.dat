60|$|We {{shall not}} need to follow the {{footsteps}} of Leonard Outram and his companions day by day. For a week they travelled on, journeying mostly by night as they had proposed. They climbed mountains, they struggled through swamps and forests, they swam rivers. Indeed one of these was in flood, and they never could have crossed it {{had it not been}} for Otter's powers of natation. Six times did the dwarf face the torrent, bearing their goods and guns held above the water with one hand. On the seventh journey he was still more heavily weighted, for, with some assistance from Leonard, he must carry the woman Soa, who could swim but little. But he did it, and without any great fatigue. It was not until Otter was seen stemming a <b>heavy</b> <b>current</b> that his vast strength could be measured. Here, indeed, his stunted stature was a positive advantage, for it offered the less surface for the water to act upon.|$|E

50|$|Some {{designs of}} vacuum {{interrupter}} have simple butt contacts, but generally the contacts are shaped {{to improve their}} ability to break very <b>heavy</b> <b>currents.</b> Slots, ridges, or grooves are formed in the contacts. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly {{over the surface of}} the contact. This reduces contact wear due to erosion by the arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.|$|R
5000|$|Synchroscopes {{are used}} in any power plant that connects to an outside power grid and also in {{isolated}} plants containing more than one generator.

50|$|The {{output of}} a rotary spark gap {{transmitter}} was turned {{on and off}} by the operator using {{a special kind of}} telegraph key that switched power going to the high voltage power supply.
