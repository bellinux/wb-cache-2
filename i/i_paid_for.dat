500|$|Lewis Hamilton {{was criticized}} for his {{aggressive}} drive into the first corner by much of the British press. Edward Gorman of The Times described Hamilton's move as [...] "impetuosity and untamed aggression", adding that Hamilton [...] "gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen". The BBC's Andrew Benson said that [...] "Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will have to cut out the mistakes that have characterised his season {{if he is not}} to lose the championship {{for the second year in}} a row." [...] In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport said that Hamilton's start suffered from [...] "his usual excessive aggression". Hamilton said [...] "I made a mistake and <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Datchet on {{the north}} bank of the River Thames has existed as a {{settlement}} since before 990 but the first recorded mention of a river crossing is in 1224 when Henry III gave John le Passir a [...] "great oak" [...] with which to make a boat for [...] "passage of Datchet". In 1278 Edward <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> William of Eton to a build a [...] "great barge" [...] for Datchet Ferry. Although the Crown had provided for the vessels, the right to operate the ferry and collect tolls sat with the Lord of the Manor of Datchet. This continued until 1680 when the then Lord of the Manor, Colonel Andrew Pitcairn Wheeler, sold the Manor of Datchet to Budd Wase but kept back the ferry rights which he subsequently mortgaged for £1000 (equivalent to £ today). In 1699 Wheeler wrote to William III complaining that a wall built by the King along the Windsor bank was adversely affecting the ferry trade. To settle the complaint the Crown purchased the ferry rights from Colonel Wheeler for £7000 (equivalent to £ today).|$|E

500|$|Troutman, {{seeing the}} disarray that was {{surrounding}} Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of {{more money for}} the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton's departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's later work. In Clinton's biography George Clinton: For the Record, Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude, [...] "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money". In response, Clinton remarked, [...] "CBS paid for it, <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. I don't like {{to go into it}} on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , and a lot of people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling". [...] The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton's and Funkadelic's musical careers. [...] The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in August 1981 on Warner Bros.|$|E
2500|$|Zemeckis {{has said}} that, {{for a long}} time, he sacrificed his {{personal}} life {{in favor of a}} career. [...] "I won an Academy Award when I was 44 years old," [...] he explained, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it with my 20s. That decade of my life from film school till 30 was nothing but work, nothing but absolute, driving work. I had no money. I had no life." [...] In the early 1980s, Zemeckis married actress Mary Ellen Trainor, with whom he had a son, Alexander Francis. He described the marriage as difficult to balance with filmmaking, and his relationship with Trainor eventually ended in divorce. On December 4, 2001, he married actress Leslie Harter, with whom he has two children.|$|E
