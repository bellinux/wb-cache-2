60|$|Without {{prejudice}} to Mr. Atwood, it {{will have}} to be acknowledged that, in this instance, it was the man who sought the office. As with the self-banished Geddie, it was nothing less than the artful smiles of lovely woman that had driven Johnny Atwood to the desperate expedient of accepting office under a despised Federal Government so that he might go far, far away and never see again the <b>false,</b> <b>fair</b> face that had wrecked his young life. The consulship at Coralio seemed to offer a retreat sufficiently removed and romantic enough to inject the necessary drama into the pastoral scenes of Dalesburg life.|$|R

60|$|The {{virtues of}} Elizabeth are {{heightened}} {{by comparison with}} the principles and actions of her attendant, the Princess Eboli. The character of Eboli is full of pomp and profession; magnanimity and devotedness are on her tongue, some shadow of them even floats in her imagination; {{but they are not}} rooted in her heart; pride, selfishness, unlawful passion are the only inmates there. Her lofty boastings of generosity are soon forgotten when the success of her attachment to Carlos becomes hopeless; the fervour of a selfish love once extinguished in her bosom, she regards the object of it with none but vulgar feelings. Virtue no longer according with interest, she ceases to be virtuous; from a rejected mistress the transition to a jealous spy is with her natural and easy. Yet we do not hate the Princess: there is a seductive warmth and grace about her character, which makes us lament her vices rather than condemn them. The poet has drawn her at once <b>false</b> and <b>fair.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a first {{approach}} to build an automatic system for broadcast news speaker-based segmentation. Based on a Chop-and-Recluster method, this system is developed {{in the framework of}} the THISL project. A metric-based segmentation is used for the Chop procedure and different distances have been investigated. The Recluster procedure relies on a bottom-up clustering of segments obtained beforehand and represented by non-parametric models. Various hierarchical clustering schemes have been tested. Some experiments on BBC broadcast news recordings show that the system can detect real speaker changes with high accuracy (mean & error 0. 7 s) and <b>fair</b> <b>false</b> alarm rate (mean false alarm & rate 5. 5 %). The Recluster procedure can produce homogeneous clusters but it is not already robust enough to tackle too complex classification tasks...|$|R

The perjury charges {{included}} one count of lying to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury in 2008 and two counts of submitting <b>false</b> material in <b>Fair</b> Political Practices reports. Although she maintains her innocence, she chose not to plea, and her case was continued. On March 30, 2011, Wilson pleaded innocent to all charges. [...] "Oh, yes, I've got to prove my innocence," [...] Wilson, 78, said at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center when asked {{if she was going}} forward with the trial. [...] "I wouldn't put my life savings … if I didn't believe in my innocence. It's all a crock." [...] In May 2011 she was convicted on six felony counts. She was sentenced on June 23, 2011, to four years in state prison and to pay more than $10,000 in restitution to the developer.|$|R

The biggest elephant had on a <b>false</b> front of <b>fair</b> curls and a marriage-ring on its tail. Stay; was it not the other one had that? No, it was the biggest. I remember now, for it was just above the marriage-ring I grasped it when I pulled its tail out. I didn't pull it off, for it wouldn't come off; it came out like a telescope or a long piece of indiarubber. Ha! and I remember thinking how painful it must be. That was odd, now, to think of that. The other elephant had on crinoline. That was odder still; for of all animals in the world it least required it. Well, let me see. What did I do? Oh yes, I shot them both. Of course, that was natural; but it wasn't quite so natural that the big one should vomit up a live lion, which attacked me with incredible fury. But I killed it cleverly. Yes, it was a clever thing, undoubtedly, to split a lion in two, from the tip of its nose to the extremity of its tail, with one stroke of a penknife--" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{failure to}} {{disclose}} this may be not just unethical but criminal in some countries. Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision {{that he would not}} have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... which causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' Griffiths (2011) [...] points to <b>false</b> claims that <b>fair</b> trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal {{failure to disclose}} the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the Third World, to disclose what this is spent on in the third world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that fair trade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.|$|R
40|$|In the 1920 's, the {{cultural}} discourse in Colombia positioned the Chibchas [...] {{also known as}} the Muiscas from Cundinamarca and Boyacá, in the Andean highlands of Colombia [...] as the third major civilization in Hispanic America, after the Aztecs and the Incas. Such hierarchy serves {{as a starting point for}} this research to trace how Colombian exhibitions in World <b>Fairs,</b> <b>false</b> archeological discoveries, the invention of legends, and new movements in the plastic arts recreated the Muiscal tradition as part of the process of cultural modernization in Colombia from 1922 to 1934. During this period, the Muiscal tradition was interpreted under inauspicious circumstances because Colombia counted neither with professional anthropologists and ethnologists, nor with the support of an "imagined national community," nor with a monumental pre-Columbian architecture associated with the greatest civilizations in Hispanic America. This dissertation offers a cultural cartography built upon concepts such as "cultural memory and counter-memory," coined by the German Egyptologist Jan Assmann. This work also uses web and Internet models to locate itineraries, transatlantic cultural encounters, and transcultural routes among Germany, France, Mexico, and Spain that helped build an imperial pre-Hispanic past for Colombia. Methodologically, in turn, using Foucault's concepts of "apparatus" or "dispositif" and "strategic and tactical productivity," as well as Kammerer's "serial pregnancy" a term borrowed from Life Sciences and epigenetics, this research identifies the types of knowledge and artistic practices that built an alternative national discourse in {{the cultural}} construction of Colombia...|$|R
