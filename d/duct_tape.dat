5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. Investigators found {{a piece of}} <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> with strands of blond hair attached to it; the samples were tested at a Dutch lab. A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor's office then traveled to the FBI central laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, to consult with American investigators. The hair samples were then tested a second time. The FBI {{announced that}} the hair samples {{did not belong to}} Holloway.|$|E
5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b> The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more {{intricate}} than the simple ones featured in Raimi's prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan {{was one of the}} primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegel's chest by straps and <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{invites the}} {{regional}} branch managers and Dunder Mifflin Scranton Human Resources representative Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) to a corporate wilderness retreat, {{but does not}} invite Michael Scott (Carell). To show that {{he is capable of}} surviving in the wilderness, Michael leaves Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in charge of the office and instructs Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to abandon him deep in the forest with merely a knife and a roll of <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b> Contrary to Michael's wishes, Dwight stays behind and surreptitiously monitors his condition from a distance. Michael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. Dwight is forced to come out of hiding to save Michael when he tries to eat wild mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
25|$|The defense called two {{government}} {{witnesses who}} countered prosecution witness testimony about the <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b> The chief {{investigator for the}} medical examiner stated that the original placement of the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> was unclear {{and it could have}} shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> found near the child's remains.|$|E

50|$|Edward Fortyhands, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Edward Ciderhands or Amy Winehands, is a drinking {{game in which}} each player <b>duct</b> <b>tapes</b> a 40-ounce or 1.14 liter bottle of alcohol (usually malt liquor, but sometimes cider, scrumpy, or wine) to each of their hands and may not remove the tape until the drinks have been consumed.
