25|$|Genetically {{modified}} crops {{engineered to}} resist herbicides {{are now more}} available than conventionally bred resistant varieties. They comprised 83% of the total GM crop area, equating to just under 8% of the arable land worldwide. Approval has been granted to grow crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, <b>dicamba,</b> glufosinate glyphosate, sulfonylurea, oxynil mesotrione and isoxaflutole Most herbicide resistant GM crops have been engineered for glyphosphate tolerance, in the USA 93% of soybeans {{and most of the}} GM maize grown is glyphosphate tolerant.|$|E
2500|$|Monsanto has {{requested}} {{approval for a}} stacked strain that is tolerant of both glyphosate and <b>dicamba.</b> The request includes plans for avoiding herbicide drift to other crops. Significant damage to other non-resistant crops occurred from <b>dicamba</b> formulations intended to reduce volatilization drifting when sprayed on resistant soybeans in 2017. The newer <b>dicamba</b> formulation labels specify to not spray when average wind speeds are above [...] to avoid particle drift, average wind speeds below [...] to avoid temperature inversions, and rain or high temperatures are {{in the next day}} forecast. However, these conditions typically only occur during June and July for a few hours at a time.|$|E
50|$|The growth {{regulating}} {{properties of}} <b>dicamba</b> were first discovered by Zimmerman and Hitchcock in 1942. Soon after Jealott's Hill Experimental Station in England was evaluating <b>dicamba</b> in the field. <b>Dicamba</b> {{has since been}} used for household and commercial weed control.|$|E
5000|$|The soil {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas maltophilia (strain DI-6) converts <b>dicamba</b> to 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid (3,6-DCSA), {{which is}} adsorbed to soil much {{more strongly than}} is <b>dicamba,</b> but lacks herbicidal activity. Little information {{is available on the}} toxicity of this breakdown intermediate. The enzymes responsible for this first breakdown step is a three-component system called <b>dicamba</b> O-demethylase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> salts {{used in some}} {{herbicides}} {{are highly}} soluble in water. A recent {{study conducted by the}} U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS 1998) found <b>dicamba</b> in 0.11%-0.15% of the ground waters surveyed. The maximum level detected was 0.0025 mg/L. The prevalence of <b>dicamba</b> in groundwater from agricultural areas (0.11%) did not correlate with nonagricultural urban areas (0.35%).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> {{was tested}} for acute {{toxicity}} {{in a variety}} of aquatic animals. The studies accepted by the U.S. EPA found <b>dicamba</b> acid and DMA salt to be practically nontoxic to aquatic invertebrates. Studies accepted by the U.S. EPA found <b>dicamba</b> acid to be slightly toxic to cold water fish (rainbow trout), and practically nontoxic to warm water fish.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> is {{released}} {{directly to the}} environment by its application as an herbicide for the control of annual broadleaf weeds. It may cause damage to plants {{as a result of}} its absorption from the soil by plant roots. <b>Dicamba</b> is mobile in most soils and significant leaching is possible. The adsorption of <b>dicamba</b> to organo-clay soil is influenced by soil pH with the greatest adsorption to soil occurring in acidic soils. <b>Dicamba</b> is moderately persistent in soil. Its reported half-life in soil ranges from 1 to 6 weeks. <b>Dicamba</b> is likely to be more rapidly degraded in soils with high microbial populations, but dissipates more slowly in hardwood forests and wetlands than would be expected from the results of laboratory studies.|$|E
50|$|Some weed {{species have}} {{developed}} resistance to <b>dicamba.</b> <b>Dicamba</b> resistance in Bassia scoparia {{was discovered in}} 1994 {{and has not been}} explained by common modes of resistance such as absorption, translocation, or metabolism.|$|E
5000|$|Increasing use of <b>dicamba</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} {{with the release of}} <b>dicamba</b> resistant genetically modified plants by Monsanto. In October 2016, the EPA launched a criminal investigation into the illegal application of older, drift prone formulations of <b>dicamba</b> onto these new plants. [...] Older formulations have been reported to drift after application and affect other crops not meant to be treated. [...] A less volatile formulation of <b>dicamba</b> made by Monsanto, designed to be less prone to vaporizing and inhibit unintended drift between fields, was approved for use in the United States by the EPA in 2016, and was expected to be commercially available in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Monsanto {{recently}} incorporated {{one component}} of the three enzymes into the genome of soybean, cotton, and other broadleaf crop plants, making them resistant to <b>dicamba.</b> Monsanto has marketed their <b>dicamba</b> resistant crops under the brand name Xtend.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> {{controls}} annual and perennial rose weeds in grain {{crops and}} highlands, {{and it is}} used to control brush and bracken in pastures, as well as legumes and cacti. It kills broadleaf weeds before and after they sprout. In combination with a phenoxy herbicide or with other herbicides, <b>dicamba</b> is used in pastures, range land, and noncrop areas (fence rows, roadways, and wastage) to control weeds. <b>Dicamba</b> is toxic to conifer species but is in general less toxic to grasses.|$|E
50|$|At a {{level of}} 10 mg/kg in sandy loam soil, <b>dicamba</b> caused a {{transient}} decrease in nitrification after two but not three weeks of incubation. The investigator determined that the decrease in nitrification is not substantial and does not suggest {{the potential for a}} prolonged impact on microbial activity. In the same study, <b>dicamba</b> did not affect ammonia formation or sulfur oxidation. In a more recent laboratory study, <b>dicamba,</b> at a concentration of 1 mg/kg soil, did not affect urea hydrolysis or nitrification in four soil types.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> {{came under}} some {{scrutiny}} {{due to its}} tendency to vaporize from treated fields and spread to neighboring crops. Monsanto began offering crops resistant to <b>dicamba</b> before a reformulated and drift resistant herbicide, which they claimed {{would be less likely}} to affect neighboring fields, had gained approval from the Environmental Protection Agency. Incidents in which <b>dicamba</b> affected neighboring fields led to complaints from farmers and fines in some US states. A lower volatility formulation, M1768, was approved by the EPA in November 2016. However, this formulation has not been evaluated by experts outside of Monsanto.|$|E
50|$|Monsanto has {{requested}} {{approval for a}} stacked strain that is tolerant of both glyphosate and <b>dicamba.</b>|$|E
50|$|Farmers {{have also}} {{expressed}} concern about being forced to grow resistant crops as protection against drifting <b>dicamba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicamba</b> {{functions}} {{by increasing}} plant growth rate. [...] At sufficient concentrations, the plant outgrows its nutrient supplies and dies.|$|E
50|$|In a three-generation study, <b>dicamba</b> did {{not affect}} the {{reproductive}} capacity of rats. When rabbits were given doses of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, or 20 (mg/kg)/day of technical <b>dicamba</b> from days 6 through 18 of pregnancy, toxic effects on the mothers, slightly reduced fetal body weights, and increased loss of fetuses occurred at the 10 mg/kg dose. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the NOAEL for this study at 3 (mg/kg)/day.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control: Myrtle spurge can be {{effectively}} controlled with products containing 2, 4-D and <b>dicamba</b> (i.e. Weed B Gon) applied in late fall.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicamba,</b> a postemergent {{broadleaf}} herbicide {{with some}} soil activity, {{is used on}} turf and field corn. It {{is another example of}} a synthetic auxin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicamba</b> (3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid) is a broad-spectrum herbicide. Brand {{names for}} {{formulations}} of this herbicide include Banvel, Diablo, Oracle and Vanquish. This chemical compound is an organochloride and a derivative of benzoic acid.|$|E
50|$|After {{plants have}} emerged from the soil (postemergent), {{products}} containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), glyphosate, and <b>dicamba</b> are effective on T. terrestris. Like most postemergents, they are more effectively maintained when caught small and young. <b>Dicamba</b> and 2,4-D will cause harm to most broad-leaved plants, so the user should take care to avoid over-application. They {{can be applied to}} lawns without injuring the desired grass. Glyphosate will kill or injure most plants, so it should only be used as a spot treatment or on solid stands of the weed. A product from DuPont called Pastora is highly effective but expensive and not for lawn use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicamba</b> {{does not}} present unusual {{handling}} hazards. It is moderately toxic by ingestion and slightly {{toxic by inhalation}} or dermal exposure (oral [...] in rats: 757 mg/kg body weight, dermal LD50 in rats: >2,000 mg/kg, inhalation LC50 in rats: >200 mg/L).|$|E
50|$|Arkansas and Missouri {{banned the}} sale and use of <b>dicamba</b> in July 2017 in {{response}} to complaints of crop damage due to drift. Monsanto responded by arguing that not all instances of crop damage had been investigated and a ban was premature.|$|E
5000|$|Selective herbicides: They {{control or}} {{suppress}} certain plants without affecting {{the growth of}} other plants species. Selectivity {{may be due to}} translocation, differential absorption, physical (morphological) or physiological differences between plant species. 2,4-D, mecoprop, <b>dicamba</b> control many broadleaf weeds but remain ineffective against turfgrasses.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{farmers and}} {{researchers}} {{have expressed concern}} about herbicide resistance after the introduction of resistant crops. [...] In the laboratory, researchers have already demonstrated weed resistance to <b>dicamba</b> within three generations of exposure. Similar herbicide resistance weeds arose after the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops (marketed as 'Roundup Ready').|$|E
5000|$|Mecoprop, or methylchlorophenoxypropionic acid (MCPP), is {{a common}} general use {{herbicide}} found in many household weed killers and [...] "weed-and-feed" [...] type lawn fertilizers. It is primarily used to control broadleaf weeds. It is often used {{in combination with other}} chemically related herbicides such as 2,4-D, <b>dicamba,</b> and MCPA.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the United States Department of Agriculture {{halted the}} use of 2,4,5-T on all food crops except rice, and in 1985, the EPA {{terminated}} all remaining uses in the U.S. of this herbicide. The international trade of 2,4,5-T is restricted by the Rotterdam Convention. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by <b>dicamba</b> and triclopyr.|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as Secretary of Agriculture, Perdue has focused on helping new farmers get started in agriculture. In August 2017, he {{announced}} a mentoring program for new farmers. Others issues addressed by Perdue include assisting rural communities, helping farmers operate with less regulation, increasing exports, passing the 2018 Farm Bill, and addressing crop damage caused by <b>dicamba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Foliar applied: These {{are applied}} to portion of the plant above the ground and are absorbed by exposed tissues. These are {{generally}} postemergence herbicides and can either be translocated (systemic) throughout the plant or remain at specific site (contact). External barriers of plants like cuticle, waxes, cell wall etc. affect herbicide absorption and action. Glyphosate, 2,4-D and <b>dicamba</b> are foliar applied herbicide.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, <b>dicamba,</b> 2,4-D, <b>dicamba</b> + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E
5000|$|Horseweed is {{commonly}} considered a weed, and in Ohio, {{it has been}} declared a noxious weed. It {{can be found in}} fields, meadows, and gardens throughout its native range. Horseweed infestations have reduced soybean yields by as much as 83%. [...] It is an especially problematic weed in no-till agriculture, as it is often resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides. Farmers are advised to include 2,4-D or <b>dicamba</b> in a burndown application prior to planting to control horseweed.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Xtend Crop System" [...] {{includes}} seed {{genetically modified}} to be resistant to both glyphosate and <b>dicamba,</b> and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients. In December 2014, {{the system was}} approved {{for use in the}} US. In February 2016, China approved the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend system. The lack of European Union approval led many American traders to reject the use of Xtend soybeans over concerns that the new seeds would become mixed with EU-approved seeds, leading Europe to reject American soybean exports.|$|E
50|$|Bindi can {{be treated}} with herbicide. Late winter and early spring are the best times to destroy the weed before its seeds germinate. Effective {{herbicides}} are typically combinations of MCPA and <b>Dicamba,</b> which target broad-leaved plants but not grasses. These chemicals have similar effects as natural plant auxins, and their increased concentrations cause unnatural plant growth which kill the plant. Mowing grass {{to a higher level}} will allow more competitive plants to thrive in the area. Bindi weed also favours compacted ground, so aerating the soil should also reduce the presence of the plant.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{herbicides}} {{used for}} controlling Yellow Star-thistle are registered for range lands, right-of-way, and other non-crop areas. Many auxin-like or growth-regulator herbicides {{are used for}} post-emergence control, including 2,4-D, aminopyralid, clopyralid, <b>dicamba,</b> picloram and triclopyr. Alternatively, glyphosate (e.g., Monsanto [...] "Roundup") may be used. Pre-emergence herbicides used for yellow star-thistle control include chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron. Pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides may be used effectively together to kill growing plants {{as well as any}} new seedlings that may emerge from the copious soil seed bank often produced by yellow starthistle. Controlled burning may also be used in conjunction with clopyralid application as an effective integrated approach to yellow star-thistle management.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control {{involves}} the use of herbicides to control diffuse knapweed. The herbicide Tordon (picloram) is recognized as the most effective, but it is common to use multiple herbicides in order to reduce strain on local grasses. The herbicides 2,4-D, <b>dicamba,</b> and glyphosate are also effective for control. In order to be most effective, it must be applied before the knapweed plants have released their seeds, regardless of which herbicide is used. Ongoing research at the University of Colorado suggests that Tordon treatment does not contribute to long-term reductions of exotic species cover and may contribute to recruitment of other invasive species, such as redstem filaree and Japanese brome, which quickly take the place of herbicide-treated diffuse knapweed.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,4-D is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} selective herbicide which kills many terrestrial and aquatic broadleaf weeds, but not grasses. It acts by mimicking {{the action of the}} plant growth hormone auxin, which results in uncontrolled growth and eventually death in susceptible plants. Because it was discovered in the 1940s, {{there is no longer a}} patent governing the manufacture and sale of 2,4-D, and any company is free to produce it. Thus, it is sold in various formulations under a wide variety of brand names. 2,4-D can be found in commercial lawn herbicide mixtures, which often contain other active ingredients including mecoprop and <b>dicamba.</b> Over 1,500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient.|$|E
