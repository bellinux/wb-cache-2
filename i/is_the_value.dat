5|$|In 1927, the Canadian {{astronomer}} William E. Harper {{used this}} technique {{to measure the}} period of this single-line spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the orbital eccentricity as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> for a circular orbit.) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component {{along the line of}} sight to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of protection: would the plant be {{less able to}} survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development {{at the time of}} feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E

25|$|We {{conclude}} that the function ψ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the minimizing integral A {{as a function of}} the upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This is the essential content of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which applies to more general variational problems.|$|E
25|$|The rated {{capacitance}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> {{for which the}} capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance of film capacitors depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for film capacitors are a measuring frequency of 1nbsp&kHz and a temperature of 20nbsp&°C. The percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. The actual capacitance value of a capacitor should be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification.|$|E
25|$|An {{ad valorem}} tax is one where the tax base <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of a good, service, or {{property}}. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value added taxes are different types of {{ad valorem tax}}. An ad valorem tax is typically imposed {{at the time of}} a transaction (sales tax or value added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).|$|E

The number of times it repeats <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the marker. Typical tests test between 30 and 120 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared {{to see if there}} is a match. Close matches may often join a surname project. DNA companies will usually provide information about how closely related two matches are, based on the difference between their results.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} debt of the United States {{is the amount}} owed {{by the federal government}} of the United States. The measure of the public debt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the outstanding Treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies. The terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative total. A deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received; a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacitance}} value {{specified in}} the data sheets of the manufacturers is called rated capacitance CR or nominal capacitance CN and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose capacitances are typically measured at 1kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5V for types with a rated voltage of ≤2.5V or 2.1 to 2.5V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5V may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.|$|E

25|$|Controlling {{interest}} level <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> that {{an investor}} {{would be willing}} to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.|$|E
25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E
25|$|Algorism {{comprises}} all of {{the rules}} for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value9, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by {{the value of the}} second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a carry of the value1.|$|E
