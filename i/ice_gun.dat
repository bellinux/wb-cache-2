50|$|During the Rebirth {{story line}} Snart {{augmented}} his Cold Gun even further by combining {{it with the}} anti-Speed Force technologies by the science criminal cell called Black Hole. The newly christened Black <b>Ice</b> <b>Gun</b> now tacked directly into The Speed Force in order to painfully disrupt a speedster's connection to it. Snart's new cold gun was so powerful that not only could it hinder the Flash in the most excruciating way possible, it was vastly more powerful in scope, able to freeze both the harbor and several city blocks adjacent to their current location.|$|E
50|$|Jason Todd and his Dollotron, dubbed Scarlet, then attack Dick and Damian, but {{the four}} are in turn {{attacked}} by the Flamingo whom they manage to defeat, but results in Damian being temporarily paralyzed. Dick then once again proves himself to be Jason's superior and apprehends the former Robin and imprisons him in Arkham and frees Scarlet of her Dollotron mask. Before Jason goes to jail, he suggests Dick revive Bruce via the Lazarus Pit, which Dick heads off to do, but finds Bruce's corpse missing. Blackest Night occurs and Dick forces himself to team up with Deadman to save Gotham from the zombie threat, they do so by freezing Gotham with Mr. Freeze's <b>ice</b> <b>gun,</b> which causes the zombies to relocate.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} the [...] "Cold, Cold Heart" [...] DLC as better paced and focused than the main game, owing to its shorter play time that {{allowed for a}} more interesting experience. It was also criticized, however, for losing focus near the end, and padding the running time with unnecessary deviations. GameSpot said that the DLC featured a satisfying combination of the series' combat, stealth, and detective mechanics, and introduced interesting new enemy types that wield <b>ice</b> <b>guns</b> capable of freezing both Batman and other enemies. Reviewers {{described the}} story as entertaining, following the interesting character of Mr. Freeze, but considered it lacking in surprise because it replicates that of the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series episode [...] "Heart of Ice". The final battle against Mr. Freeze was criticized for replicating several elements of {{the fight against the}} character in Arkham City. Similarly, IGN and Destructoid noted that the content lacked originality and innovation, providing generic environments and removing, rather than adding new abilities and weapons.|$|R
50|$|Unlike its {{predecessor}} {{which was a}} 3D third person shooter, this game is a 2D side-scroller in order to evoke {{the feel of a}} retro game, however, the game developers make use of 3D graphics. The player has the ability to use upgraded weapons with limited ammo. Players also are able to use shoulder buttons to enter precision aim mode. Levels contain boxes allowing the player to power up. The game features three difficulty modes: Wussy, Damn This is Hard, and Fuck This Shit, the most difficult mode, in which enemies are able to kill players in just one hit. The game also contains a two player co-op mode, in which the second player controls Hazard's partner Dexter Dare. Weapons available to the player include flamethrowers, shotguns, grenades, plasma rifles and <b>ice</b> <b>guns.</b> The player is also able to deflect missiles the enemy fires at them by shooting at them. The game also features a large amount of graphic violence, unlike {{its predecessor}}.|$|R

5000|$|After Catwoman's {{hotel room}} burns down, {{forcing her to}} jump into a pool {{completely}} naked in order to escape death, Catwoman, Eddie (as Selina refers to him) and the Blonde escape to his yacht. In a pitched fight with the Don's son Guillermo, Catwoman is put [...] "on ice" [...] using Mr. Freeze's <b>ice</b> <b>gun,</b> but escapes and barters a deal with Guillermo. The Riddler then retreats back to Gotham City {{for a short time}} (in which he attends the Hangman Trial conducted by Two-Face during the parallel events of Batman: Dark Victory). After stealing a valuable ring from the Vatican, Catwoman is attacked by the Cheetah. After Catwoman defeats the villain (with the assistance of The Blonde), she visits Louisa, Carmine's widow. Louisa denies that Catwoman is her daughter, and then orders the Blonde to kill Catwoman.|$|E
5000|$|In the New 52 {{universe}} Captain Cold temporarily had metahuman ice powers, {{including the}} power {{to slow down the}} Flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by Absolute Zero, but these powers are later lost in the Forever Evil series when he is attacked by Deathstorm- the Earth-3 counterpart of Firestorm- with Cold reverting to using his classic <b>ice</b> <b>gun.</b> Despite his lack of professional or technical expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop. He's even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers; like his [...] "Cold Field" [...] which quick cools the atmosphere to the point everything caught in it grinds to a halt, or an auto activation function which triggers his Cold Gun's freeze ray via vocalized password input.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} the cannon-shot on board the yacht itself was {{somewhat}} startling. The gun had been loaded {{on the other side}} of the promontory for the purpose of being fired if Eskimos were not visible on the coast beyond, in order to attract them from the interior, if they should chance to be there. When, however, the natives were discovered on the <b>ice,</b> the <b>gun</b> was, of course, unnecessary, and had been forgotten. It therefore burst upon the crew with a shock of surprise, and caused the Captain, who was in the cabin at the moment, to shoot up from the hatchway like a Jack-in-the-box.|$|R
60|$|Our Indian {{was not the}} man {{to start}} up and stare, and wonder, and wait for a {{repetition}} of any cry. Like the deer which he had so often roused, he leaped up, bounded through the doorway of his tent, and grasped gun and snow-shoes. One glance sufficed to show him the not far distant hole in the <b>ice.</b> Dropping the <b>gun</b> he thrust his feet into the snowshoes, and went off over the ice at racing speed. The snow-shoes did not impede him much, and they rendered the run over the ice less dangerous. Probably Lumley would not have broken through if he had used his snow-shoes, because of the larger surface of ice which they would have covered.|$|R
5000|$|Lorne {{returned}} home in 1995 ready to switch gears and {{with plenty of}} songs to write. It was then that he started working with Toronto writer and producer Peter Linseman (Angelica Dicastro, Sarina Paris.) In 1998, Lorne received a FACTOR Grant and started production on his debut solo album, <b>Ice</b> Cream And <b>Guns</b> (1999). The album was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario and was co-produced by Lorne, Juno Award winning engineer L. Stu Young (Guns 'n' Roses) and Linseman. The title track was co-written with Juno Award winning writer Naoise Sheridan (Kenny Chesney & Jimmy Rankin.) Three of the singles were featured nationwide on the television show [...] "Up And Coming" [...] produced by the New VR (A-Channel.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The toy {{is based}} on a rabbit figure with {{distinctive}} tubular ears. The origin of the name Dunny came from a combination of street slang and one of the early [...] "Devil Bunny" [...] prototypes.The Dunny is sold in 3-, 8- and 20-inch scales, though artists have customized Dunny models as tall as four feet. The toy has three points of articulation; a 360-degree rotational head and two arms. Some come with accessories, such as laser <b>guns,</b> <b>ice</b> cream cones, marker pens, Geisha fans, gas masks, crowns and hooded sweatshirts. Artist cards or stickers are also included, mainly with the annual series releases. Other (often themed) series releases typically include only a leaflet with the designs from that series. The buying and trading of Dunnys has reached to eBay and beyond.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{means of}} utilising dry <b>ice</b> in spud <b>guns</b> {{is to use}} the {{sublimation}} of dry ice to create substantial pressure behind a valve, and placing a barrel {{on the other side of}} that valve with a projectile loaded into it. Pressures behind the valve can reach upwards of , and by quickly releasing the valve, the projectile can be launched. Whilst this method is more controllable and in many means safer than utilising a soda bottle as a burst disk (provided pressure rated valves and piping are used), it is limited in that quick release valves, such as ball valves, are generally not bigger in diameter than 1 or 2 inches. Additionally, they cannot be opened as rapidly as a soda bottle will rupture, and consequently there is less immediate airflow. However, this is offset by the fact that such a design can operate at more than double the pressure of a typical dry ice bomb launcher, as soda bottles will rupture at only [...]|$|R
