Florence) This {{research}} {{represents a}} longitudinal study of changing patterns of governance in six microregions in Hungary. Its findings indicate that the dominant trend was a move from a nonhierarchical mode of governance, including integrated developmental policy making by diverse local state and non-state actors in the early 1990 s, towards fragmented and hierarchical modes of governance by the 2000 s. By the time Hungary had moved closer to EU accession, non-hierarchical and inclusive institutional solutions (<b>heterarchies)</b> had started to disappear from micro-regional governance {{in comparison to the}} early 1990 s. Only a few micro-regional collaborations could survive the Europeanization of sub-national governance. These evolutionary trends were mainly shaped by domestic factors, the EU having only indirect influence on the process through providing the central state with prerogatives {{near the end of the}} decade to control regional and sub-regional development policy. This is only part of the story, however. Pre-accession support programs had also strengthened the governance capacities of sub-national state and non-state actors and enabled local political entrepreneurs to organize micro-regional territorial development through <b>heterarchies</b> even in the face of asymmetric power constellations between central governments and local state and non-state actors. The basic underlying assumption of this research, based on heterodox development theories, is that there is an interplay between heterarchic governance patterns and socioeconomic development. The case studies confirm that in an unstable and swiftly changing political, economic and institutional environment, heterarchic institutional solutions are necessary to maintain at least an average developmental level or to change a development path...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{concepts}} {{from the}} theory of the firm and MIS research to argue that some types of information technology (IT) will be deployed only within hierarchical governance structures. This argument introduces a contingency into the 'electronic markets hypothesis,' which holds that greater use of IT is unidirectionally associated with reduced use of hierarchies. We revisit the assumption that interfirm IT is never a relationship-specific asset. While many types of interfirm IT are highly redirectable others are not, and become relationship-specific assets once configured for a particular context; these assets are referred to here as enterprise information technologies. Because complete contracts over IT assets are not possible, relationship specificity is an important consideration; scholarship on {{the theory of}} the firm yields a consistent prescription that when assets are relationship specific and contracts incomplete, the single decision-making authority of a hierarchy is optimal. The paper therefore argues that when enterprise IT is required, so is an electronic hierarchy: a collaboration in which one member has all required decision rights over jointly used IT. This contingent theory yields three hypotheses, which are tested using data gathered from firms in Italian industrial districts. Because of this paper's focus on governance rather than price-setting, electronic hierarchies are contrasted not with electronic markets, but instead with electronic <b>heterarchies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Agent-oriented {{software}} engineering {{is a new}} {{software engineering}} paradigm that is ideally suited to the analysis and design of complex systems. Open distributed environments place a growing demand on complex systems to be adaptive as well. Complex systems that can learn from and adapt to dynamically changing environments are called complex adaptive systems. These systems are characterized by emergent behaviour caused by interactions between system components and the environment. Agent-oriented software engineering methodologies attempt to control emergence during analysis and design by engineering the complex system {{in such a way}} that the correct emergent behaviour results during run-time. In a complex adaptive system however, emergent behaviour cannot be predicted during analysis and design, as it evolves only after implementation. By restricting emergent behaviour, as is done in most agent-oriented software engineering approaches, a complex system cannot be fully adaptive as well. We propose the BaBe methodology that will enable a complex system to be adaptive by learning from its environment and modifying its behaviour during run-time. This methodology adds a run-time emergence model consisting of distributed Bayesian behaviour networks to the agent-oriented software engineering lifecycle. These networks are initialised by the human software engineer during analysis and design and deployed by Bayesian agencies (also complex adaptive systems). The Bayesian agents are simple, and collectively they implement distributed Bayesian behaviour networks. These networks, being specialized Bayesian networks, enable the Bayesian agents to collectively mine relationships between emergent behaviours and the interactions that caused them to emerge, in order to adapt the behaviour of the system. The agents are organized into <b>heterarchies</b> of agencies, where each agency activates one or more component behaviour depending on the inference in the underlying Bayesian behaviour network. These agencies assist the human software engineer to bridge the gap between the implementation and the understanding of emergent behaviour in complex adaptive systems. Due to the simplicity of the agents and the minimal communication amongst them, they can be implemented using a commercially available component architecture. We describe a prototype implementation of the Bayesian agencies using Sun’s Enterprise JavaBeans™ component architecture. Thesis (PhD (Computer Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.

40|$|Software {{agent-based}} strategies using micro-economic theory like PowerMatcher[1] {{have been}} utilized to coordinate demand and supply matching for electricity. Virtual power plants (VPPs) using these strategies {{have been tested}} in living lab environments {{on a scale of}} up to hundreds of households. So far, the coordination configuration of a VPP is fixed in these settings. The DREAM [2] framework architecture uses <b>heterarchies</b> to make parts of a VPP flexible in coordination strategy depending on the current operational grid status. In this way, a sub-VPP, serving one coordination objective, can decouple from and couple to an overarching VPP with another coordination objective dynamically. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e In this paper a grid congestion simulation with an overarching VPP coordinating demand and supply for electricity market optimization [3] and a sub-VPP reacting to a heat-pump congestion event in winter and a PV overproduction event in summer is described. The simulation was run in a static simulator [4]. The LV-segment consisted of ‘flameless’ residential areas with well-insulated homes with primarily heat pumps for heating and some renovated homes with local gas-fired co-generators of heat and electricity. Households additionally had solar cells, batteries and EV charging units. The goal of the additional coordination sub-VPP was to solve grid stability issues like congestion due to heat pump loads in winter and overproduction by PV in summer in this physical part locally, {{while the rest of the}} cluster remained unaffected and still optimizing for the commercial goal. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e The results were analyzed in terms of infringement of comfort parameters and performance in adapting the flexible load and generation. It appeared, substantial load shedding and load shifting of devices is possible to show the synergy in solving the grid stability issues evenly sharing the discomfort to the individual heating devices. By changing their charging strategy, the new algorithm also showed heat storage and electricity storage devices providing additional support. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eINTRODUCTION 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e The simplest definition of flexibility can be given as a bandwidth around a required momentary power value of a connection or a device. The flexibility can be discriminated in a part to be used in normal operation, that, for example, might be expressed in a PowerMatcher bid-curve [1]. This part may be utilized by a commercial party in normal grid operation to balance the portfolio. The timescale for it to be mobilized is in the order of tens of seconds to minutes. Another part can be utilized as a contingency reserve by a grid operator to prevent the operation of the power system to go into a critical situation. The second part typically has to be used in the seconds scale. In micro-economic terms, primary processes, using electrical energy, have different utilities for flexibility on these different time scales. This economic utility can be translated in a price that can be used for coordination. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 98 - 124) This thesis takes a problem-oriented approach both {{in interpreting}} mortuary practices and behaviors, and in making inferences on social organizations from mortuary contexts. The data presented within this study comes from three sites located along {{of the coastal}} bluffs ofLa Jolla, San Diego County, California. Regional models and theoretical frameworks have predominantly approached premodern social systems as vertical structures (e. g. stratified, hierarchies) without recognizing the variability and dynamics that may have existed in other social organizations. For instance, perhaps more horizontal systems (e. g. <b>heterarchies)</b> were organized and founded on elaborate kinshipbased networks. The strategic relationships found within vertical and horizontal organizations, and in the oscillations that may exist within either conceptual system are worth deeper anthropological exploration. Contemporary archaeologists in southern California seem to primarily focus on identifying vertical systems and supplement such findings through the indication of status within the archaeological record (e. g. Gamble et al. 2001; King 1990; Martz 1984). Likewise, research investigating social status and hierarchies has often looked for ranking within mortuary contexts to supplement such claims. Perhaps {{we need to look}} beyond status and our preset notions of social organizations, and take an open-ended approach to research. As Lightfoot and colleagues (20 11) point out in reference to mortuary research and the lack of grave goods in burials found in shell mounds of the San Francisco Bay Area: " [...] . it can be challenging to analyze burials through an interpretive framework that requires, from the outset, the presence of diverse assemblages of grave goods in order to evaluate social ranking. More to the point, efforts to identify rank may force the evidence into a framework where ranking is assumed to have existed, doing little to shed light on either mortuary behaviors or sociopolitical hierarchies. Instead, it may be much more useful to expand the ways in which mortuary evidence is analyzed, to introduce interpretive frameworks that do not rely exclusively on the search for rank, and to move toward assessments that emphasize the totality of the mortuary behavior at a site, rather than those that focus on individual burials" (Lightfoot et al. 2011 : 70). Because of these prevalent frameworks, often times archaeological sites exhibiting mortuary components with little differentiation in burials have either been analyzed and reported in a rudimentary manner, or have been presumed to represent simple egalitarian social systems. The sites ofW- 5, W- 9, and W- 12 along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast ofLa Jolla, San Diego County, California have exhibited a rather high number of burials within a concentrated area approximately one kilometer in length. Although records seem to indicate that 149 burials have been recorded, notes suggest that over 300 burials have been observed at these sites. Significantly, radiocarbon dates and temporally-sensitive artifacts seem to indicate that these sites were used at least intermediately throughout the course of the Holocene Epoch, almost 10, 000 years ago and into the Late Prehistoric Period. The following research takes a historical approach and utilizes humanistic theories in an attempt to better interpret the mortuary practices and behaviors at these sites, with the intention to more accurately represent the sociocultural dynamics of organizations and lifeways of the premodern peoples of La Jolla. Burial analyses will look at age and sex vis-a-vis position and orientations, and investigate any spatial patterning represented in discrete areas at each site, as well as any patterns across the three sites...|$|R
