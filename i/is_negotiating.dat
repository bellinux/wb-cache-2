40|$|Effective {{conversation}} {{occurs when}} beliefs <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> through interaction and evolve in {{a framework of}} goals. Concurrently, goals <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve through interaction. Such conversations are processes of design. Similarly, design—where proposed constructions <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve toward goals, while goals for the design <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve—is a process of conversation. Outcomes from such activities are greatly facilitated, in my view, from an understanding of Pask’s two main frameworks from conversation theory: a structure for the architecture of conversations and a schema for modeling the evolution of conversations. My conviction is that these {{can be used to}} mirror how design happens. This begs the question, can it help designers design? Yes, I believe it can. This paper offers a review of Pask’s frameworks and discusses their application in theory and practice...|$|R

However, the pro-settlement side and Mehmet Ali Talat lost momentum due to the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union that these would be eased. As a result, the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu, winning the presidential elections in 2010.
