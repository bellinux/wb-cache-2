5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Germany {{was charged}} with {{sweeping}} all naval mines in the North Sea by the Treaty of Versailles. Arcona was used as a depot ship for the minesweepers <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> duty, from 1919 to 1920. She was thereafter commissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine in 1921 and served until 1923, when she was withdrawn from service. She was stricken on 15 January 1930 and used as a barracks ship initially in Wilhelmshaven, after 1936, in Swinemünde by the newly renamed Kriegsmarine, and in Kiel after 1938, where she remained until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|In early May 1917, the 12th Battalion was {{involved}} in the British and Australian attempt to capture the village of Bullecourt. While <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation on 6 May, Newland was wounded for the third and final time of the war by a gunshot to his left armpit. Initially admitted to the 5th Field Ambulance, he was transferred to No 1 Red Cross Hospital, Le Touquet, the next day. The injury necessitated treatment in England, and Newland was shipped to a British hospital eight days later.|$|E

5|$|The 12th Battalion {{spent the}} next two months engaged in minor {{operations}} in Belgium, before once again transferring to the trenches in France during December. During this time, Whittle was re-promoted to the rank of sergeant. With the commencement of the German Spring Offensive of 1918, the 12th Battalion assisted in repulsing the assault in the months of March and April. While <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation, Whittle was wounded on 19 March and admitted to a field hospital suffering shrapnel wounds to his right hand. Recovering from the wound, he returned to the 12th Battalion in April. Later that month, Whittle was charged with conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline a second time for mutilating his pay book; he was reprimanded by the battalion's commanding officer as a result.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the upper Naktong valley {{at the end}} of July, the North Korean divisions <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> part of the drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang {{at the end of}} July it was down to 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The NK 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, and was down to about 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E

5|$|Tensions in Europe {{had been}} {{steadily}} mounting since the French Revolution of 1789 and in 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began with {{war between the}} new French Republic and the Austrian and Prussian Empires. Great Britain was not initially <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conflict, but diplomatic relations with France were rapidly deteriorating. On 1 February 1793, shortly after {{the execution of the}} deposed King Louis XVI, the French National Convention declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. Due to the long distances involved, it took five months for news of the outbreak of war to reach India, passing through the British consul at Alexandria, George Baldwin. On 2 June the news arrived at Madras and passed to Calcutta on 11 June. The Governor-General of India Lord Cornwallis issued instructions for operations against the territories of French India. Lord Cornwallis, brother to William, originally intended to participate in the surrender of Pondicherry himself in the seized French merchant ship Bien Aimé, but was eventually dissuaded.|$|E

25|$|Whole Language {{is widely}} used in the U.S.A. and Canada. It is a reading and {{learning}} method that trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters. This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher. While the child is typically very <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's decoding and spelling to suffer during development.|$|E
