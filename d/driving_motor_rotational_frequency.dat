40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new antenna system designed for cognitive radio applications. The antenna structure {{consists of a}} UWB antenna and a frequency reconfigurable antenna system. The UWB antenna scans the channel to discover “white space ” frequency bands while tuning the reconfigurable section to communicate within these bands. The frequency agility is achieved via a rotational motion of the antenna patch. The rotation is controlled by a stepper motor mounted {{on the back of}} the antenna structure. The <b>motor’s</b> <b>rotational</b> motion is controlled by LABVIEW on a computer connected to the motor through its parallel port. The computer’s parallel port is connected to a NPN Darlington array that is used to drive the stepper motor. The antenna has been simulated with the <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> being taken into consideration. A good agreement is found between the simulated and the measured antenna radiation properties.

40|$|Abstract An {{electric}} motor {{is the one}} of the most important parts in robot systems, which mainly drives the wheel of mobile robots or the joint of manipulators. According to the requirement of motor performance, the controller type and parameters vary. For the wheel <b>driving</b> <b>motors,</b> a speed tracking controller is used, while a position tracking controller is required for the joint <b>driving</b> <b>motors.</b> Moreover, if the mechanical parameters are changed or a different motor is used, we might have to tune again the controller parameters. However, for the beginners who are not familiar about the controller design, it is hard to design pertinently. In this paper, we develop a nominal robust controller model for the velocity tracking of wheel <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> and the position tracking of joint <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> based on th...|$|R

40|$|Motor-driven {{flexible}} manipulator systems (MDFMSs) {{are widely}} used in industry robot fields. During the dynamic modeling, the separate investigation method which neglects the dynamic behavior of the <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> will cause an error in the dynamic analysis of the flexible manipulator, especially with high-speed operations. This paper proposes a coupled dynamic model of the MDFMS in which the <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> and flexible manipulator are considered as an integrated system, which can clearly reflect {{the influence of the}} dynamic effect of the <b>driving</b> <b>motor.</b> Based on the proposed dynamic model, the vibration responses of the flexible manipulator under different velocities, accelerations and structure parameters, as well as the effect mechanism of the <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> on the vibration responses, are investigated.

40|$|International audienceIn machining, tool {{condition}} monitoring (TCM) {{is one of}} the major trends of development of process efficiency. By monitoring tool wear and detecting tool-teeth break, TCM is able to protect tool, machine and workpiece, which corresponds to important savings. Cutting forces are often considered as the best indicator for detecting tool wear and damage, but they are very difficult and expensive to measure directly in industrial cases. The aim of this work is to develop a new method using standard transducers available on actual machines for a better monitoring of cutting process. This method analyses instantaneous variations in <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> so as to observe milling operation. Experimental cutting tests were performed on a milling machine. On one hand, cutting forces were acquired through common dynamometer. On the other hand, signal from spindle integrated rotary encoder is acquired using specific angular-sampling methodology. Spindle <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> is then easily computed using rudimentary signal processing tools. Correspondence between cutting force magnitude and variation in spindle <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> is noted: when a tooth goes in material, cutting force suddenly increases, and <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> starts to decrease until cutting force becomes low enough. Thus, apparition of tool wear can be observed by monitoring variations in <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> according to the different teeth of the tool. Moreover, a sudden variation in the amplitude of slow-down due to a tooth allows detection of tooth breakage. Instantaneous variations in spindle <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> are shown to be very effective indicators for tool condition in comparison with cutting force, so they must be very useful for TCM systems...|$|R
