SEM, XRD, SAXS and FT-IR were used to ascertain {{the effects of the}} molecular size of the <b>esterified</b> <b>acid,</b> the composition of the base maize starch and the DS on their structural properties. LAMS and HAMS did not differ significantly at the microscopic level. However, substantial differences were found at the nanostructural levels {{as a function of the}} <b>esterified</b> fatty <b>acid,</b> highlighting the importance of these length scales for the understanding of the macroscopic functional characteristics. Although the crystal unit cell remained practically unchanged, as deduced from the similar X-ray diffraction patterns, an increase in long-range order was observed with increasing fatty acid chain length. Conversely, shorter acyl chain lengths were related to greater decreases in the electron density difference between the amorphous and crystalline lamellae, suggesting the introduction of defects in the lamellar structure. From the SAXS results, it appears that the longer esterified chains are able to be accommodated within the crystalline lamellar regions so that the nanostructure is affected less by butyrylation than by the addition of acetyl or propionyl groups. © 2009, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{walls of}} grasses have two major polysaccharides that contain uronic acids, the hemicellulosic glucuronoarabinoxylans and the galactosyluronic acid-rich pectins. A {{technique}} whereby <b>esterified</b> uronic <b>acid</b> carboxyl groups are reduced selectively to yield their respective 6, 6 -dideuterio neutral sugars {{was used to}} determine the extent of esterification and changes in esterification of these two uronic acids during elongation of maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles. The glucosyluronic acids of glucuronoarabinoxylans did not appear to be esterified at any time during coleoptile elongation. The galactosyluronic acids of embryonal coleoptiles were about 65 % esterified, but this proportion increased to nearly 80 % during the rapid elongation phase before returning to about 60 % at the end of elongation. Methyl esters accounted for about two-thirds of the total <b>esterified</b> galacturonic <b>acid</b> in cell walls of unexpanded coleoptiles. The proportion of methyl esters decreased throughout elongation and did not account for the increase in the proportion of <b>esterified</b> galactosyluronic <b>acid</b> units during growth. The results indicate that the galactosyluronic acid units of grass pectic polysaccharides may be converted to other kinds of esters or form ester-like chemical interactions during expansion of the cell wall.

Mass spectra were also recorded. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on Merck silica gel and the spray reagent was iodine or vanillin. To a solution of testosterone the corresponding acid chloride was added yielding the pure ester after the usual work-up. E- 5 -methylhexa- 2, 4 -dienoic (IXb), 5 - phenylpenta- 2 -, 4 -dienoic (Xb), 5 -phenyl- 4 -yn-pent- 2 -enoic (XIb), and non- 4 -en- 6 -ynoic acid (XIIb), were required for the synthesis.
