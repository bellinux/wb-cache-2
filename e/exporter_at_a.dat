40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the United States imposed high tariffs to protect {{domestic}} manufacturers from foreign competition. This paper examines the magnitude of protection given to import-competing producers and the costs imposed on export-oriented producers by focusing on changes in the domestic prices of traded goods relative to non-traded goods. Because the tariffs tended to increase the prices of non-traded goods, the degree of protection was much less than indicated by nominal rates of protection; the results here suggest that the 30 percent average tariff on imports yielded a 15 percent implicit subsidy to import-competing producers while effectively taxing <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rate of 11 percent. The paper also finds that tariff policy redistributed large amounts of income (about 9 percent of GDP) across groups, although the impact on consumers was only slightly negative because they devoted a sizeable share of their expenditures to exportable goods. These findings may explain why import-competing producers pressed for even greater protection {{in the face of}} already high tariffs and why consumers (as voters) did not strongly oppose the policy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} {{strategic}} {{view of what}} South African trade policy should be doing {{in relation to the}} future global trading environment. The future is uncertain, but if the past is prologue, South African trade policy needs to be positioned for a continuation of the commodity cycle, and to exploit markets in emerging economies, including Africa, more fully. Simultaneously, it needs policies to spur labour-intensive services and manufacturing exports, both because these will be needed if commodity markets are less robust and because of their employment-creating potential. South Africa's current strategy, however, is inflexible, heavily focused on domestic concerns and is in danger of placing South African <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage in accessing the growing emerging economies. It also gives rise to an inherent tension between the interests of South Africa and the African region in trade negotiations. Having as the central tenet of trade policy a commitment to deal with tariffs on a case-by-case basis will not serve South Africa well in the global economy that is likely to emerge over the next 15 years. A simpler tariff structure would facilitate the conclusion of free trade agreements and actually make industrial policy more effective...|$|R
40|$|From the mid- 1950 s to 1990, sub-Saharan Africa's {{share of}} global exports fell from 3. 1 to under 1. 2 percent, a decline that implies {{associated}} export earning losses of about $ 65 billion annually. Previous {{studies show that}} foreign trade barriers do not account for this poor performance. Indeed, African exports enjoy OECD tariff preferences. In the sub-Saharan African countries, too high a proportion of foreign exchange earnings is paying for Africa's high export transport costs. The authors demonstrate that relatively high transportation costs - especially for processed products - often place African <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> serious competitive disadvantage. African countries must use a far larger share of their foreign exchange earnings to pay for international transport services than other developing countries do - and {{the relative importance of}} those payments has been increasing. Why are Africa's transport costs so high? Ill-advised policies {{on the part of some}} African governments seem to have played a role, as their cargo reservation policies produced high"rents"for lines that have been shielded from the effects of competition. The failure to maintain or improve port and transport infrastructure has also played a role.

The theoretical flexibility provided by this combination of approaches enabled us to draw out a number of implications from the data that bear on strategy formulation. Factors found to have significant bearing on the early adoption of EXDOC included: (1) idiosyncratic factors precipitating the initial implementation (2) the constraints based on accommodating user capabilities (3) the organisational role taken by AQIS (4) diffusion as a self-reinforcing and value-adding effect. A standard represents both a problem as a requirement of such a system and a problem solving strategy eliciting compliance to the system requirements. Over the period of shaping and stabilizing of the industry standard, AQIS was required to act as facilitator in the coordination of the actors. The implementation of systems like EXDOC enables users to identify what they want from a system, specifying their preferences and tradeoffs. Such implementations offer opportunities for systems redesign within export business sectors with major strategic implications for the industry. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to explain how disaggregated-product level trade data fits into Eaton and Kortum (2002) type Ricardian trade model. In their paper, Eaton and Kortum (2002) explain the effect of {{geographical}} barriers and technological differences on trade between countries using data at aggregate level. Their model with perfect competition and constant marginal costs actually implies that the countries who have the lowest cost in supplying a particular good to a particular destination should capture the entire demand for that good in that destination. However, {{this is not what}} is observed in disaggregated bilateral trade data even in the least aggregated level. In this thesis, we propose alternative explanations such as capacity constraints and increasing marginal costs to reconcile Eaton and Kortum (2002) setup with disaggregated bilateral trade data. Our aim is to investigate why one seller is not able to win the entire market. The results suggest that costs are not increasing with trade quantities thus constant marginal costs is still possible. To explain multiple sellers for each good and the fact that each <b>exporter</b> sells <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different unit price. It could be the case that exporters are bounded by capacity constraints for each good in a given market. We report relative productivities of <b>exporters</b> <b>at</b> each destination where we report to a destination with a low trade cost even low productive firms can compete but for destinations with a high trade costs only most productive firms export.

40|$|This paper forms {{part of an}} OIES Gas Programme {{research}} theme {{focusing on}} the most important national gas markets in Europe (and elsewhere). The rationale behind these papers is that individual markets have specific characteristics and complexities which are essential to understand in order to look at future trends. This paper follows the previous publications on the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil and Iran. The Dutch gas market, one of Europeâs key <b>exporters,</b> is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> significant turning point. A much stronger than usual earth tremor in 2012 caused by the extraction of gas from Groningen prompted the government to take action and restrain production from the field to help minimize the seismicity. In 2016, gas production from the giant field was less than half the volumes produced just three years previously, with almost no flexibility to cope with seasonality of demand. Nobody seems to be paying much attention to it maybe because there have been no signs of any major threat to security of gas supply nationally and in North West Europe. However, the complete change in the Dutch gas outlook means a major fall in regional production from a European perspective and a big increase in imports from elsewhere with potential security of supply implications (volumes, capacity, prices, and/or dependence). Consideration on the safety and health of the people of Groningen has also changed public opinion about gas dramatically. The use of renewables in power generation and an increased focus on energy efficiency have become the key policy drivers but the transition towards a sustainable economy is also overwhelmed by an anti-gas sentiment. This dramatic evolution casts an important doubt over the future of gas in the country but equally importantly in Europe as a whole, particularly for those countries in the North-West of the region whose imports of Dutch L-gas and H-gas have historically been crucial elements of their supply. It is no longer âbusiness as usualâ and this paper offers some food for thought on the challenges but also the prospects and expectations for the Dutch gas industry looking ahead to a 2030 horizon...|$|R

According to the Commission 'the reduction is necessary to bring the EU in conformity with their WTO obligations'. The regulation also cuts EU refiners' 'maximum supply needs'.

Comment: As can be seen there is rarely a correlation between the quotas allocated under the sugar regime and actual production. EU quota cuts will not necessarily have any impact on EU production.
