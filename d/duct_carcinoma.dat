Objectives: Little {{is known}} about the {{radiation}} sensitivity of bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The current study was undertaken to prospectively assess the objective response rates in bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinomas</b> treated with radiotherapy and razoxane. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three patients with advanced cancer of the biliary tree were irradiated together with the radiosensitizer razoxane at a dose of 125 mg twice daily by mouth. There were 16 females and 7 males, median age 68 years. They received a total tumor dose of 48 Gy (range 1. 7 â€“ 60) at the ICRU point with single fractions of 1. 7 to 2 Gy. Results: Among the 23 patients, 14 had measurable disease. Objective tumor responses were seen in 4 / 4 gallbladder carcinomas (1 CR, 3 PR), 4 / 5 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (2 CR, 2 PR), and 1 / 5 hepatobiliary cancers (1 PR), leading to an overall response rate of 64 %.

50|$|Salivary <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> {{abbreviated}} SDC, {{is a rare}} type {{of aggressive}} cancer that arises from the salivary glands.

40|$|The {{carcinoma}} of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder has {{with the exception of}} the {{carcinoma of}} the papilla of Vater a very bad prognosis. Even though resection rates and perioperative mortality were improved, the survival rates remain unfavourably. This study investigated retrospectively the survival and success of surgical therapy of 87 patients with carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder, which were treated at the surgical department of the university hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Germany, from 1986 until 1997. This data and the follow-up were obtained by retrieving information from the patient's files and through questioning of the patient's physicians. Additionally was the obtained data screened for a clinical or laboratory parameter which correlated with the survival rates. Results: The 1 year survival rates were 19 % for the proximal bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> 44 % for the middle bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> 44 % for the distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> 17 % for the gallbladder carcinoma and 75 % for the {{carcinoma of the}} papilla of Vater. The 5 year survival rates were for the proximal bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma</b> 6 %, for the middle and distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma</b> 0 %, for the gallbladder carcinoma 7 % and for the carcinoma of the papilla of Vater 55 %.

40|$|From 1989 through 1992, {{endoscopic}} ultrasonography (EUS) was undertaken preoperatively {{to evaluate the}} extent of primary tumor, involvement of regional lymph nodes, and distant metastases in 22 patients with ampullary carcinoma and 18 patients with bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> The results were compared with histopathological findings according to the TNM staging system. The accurate rate in assessing the extent of cancer invasion was 82 % for ampullary carcinoma, 66 % for common hepatic <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> and 78 % for common bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> The accuracy of EUS in predicting regional lymph node metastasis was 59 % for ampullary carcinoma, 56 % for common hepatic <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> and 67 % for common bile <b>duct</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Invasion of the portal vein was correctly predicted by EUS in 2 of 3 patients.

40|$|The {{classification}} of poorly differentiated carcinomas involving the renal medullary/sinus region might be challenging on conventional histomorphologic grounds alone. However, delineation of high-grade renal cell carcinomas such as collecting <b>duct</b> (Bellini) <b>carcinoma</b> from urothelial cell {{carcinoma of the}} renal pelvis is critical, as it conveys important therapeutic implications. We assessed the so far neglected differential diagnostic role of protein gene product 9. 5, a neuropeptide involved in intracellular proteolysis, in terms of differentiating invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis from high-grade renal cell carcinomas infiltrating the renal medullary/sinus region. To this aim, 21 invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and 27 high-grade renal cell carcinomas (8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and 5 type 1 and 7 type 2 papillary renal cell carcinomas as well as 7 collecting <b>duct</b> <b>carcinomas)</b> were stained with antibodies directed against protein gene product 9. 5, CD 10, vimentin, CEA, p 63, CK 5 / 6, CK 7, CK 20, PAX 2, PAX 8, CD 117 (c-Kit), AE 1 / 3, Î±-methyl CoA racemase, actin, and desmin. Briefly, strong protein gene product 9. 5 expression was observed in 6 (86 %) of 7 collecting <b>duct</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 8 (67 %) of 12 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 2 (25 %) of 8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. Conversely, none of the 21 urothelial cell carcinomas investigated showed protein gene product 9. 5 expression. Our findings suggest that protein gene product 9. 5, particularly if {{used in conjunction with}} p 63 and CK 5 / 6, might be helpful in differentiating high-grade renal cell carcinomas from urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, whereas its specificity with respect to the histologic subtyping of renal cell carcinomas seems to be low.

There are two growth patterns, polypoid and non-polypoid infiltrative type, but little {{information is available}} concerning the relation between growth pattern and genetic alterations. A comparative study was therefore conducted to clarify if differences in genetic changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 5 q, 9 p, 17 p, and 18 q, and K-ras mutations exist between polypoid and non-polypoid infiltrative type BDCs. LOH analysis was performed using microsatellite markers and K-ras point mutations were analysed by dot blot hybridisation. The incidences of changes for polypoid and non-polypoid infiltrative types were 73 % and 26 % on 5 q, 63 % and 59 % on 9 p, 55 % and 50 % on 17 p, and 20 % and 18 % on 18 q, and 25 % and 27 % for K-ras mutations. Most importantly, we found the frequency of 5 qLOH to be significantly higher with polypoid growth than in the non-polypoid infiltrative type (p< 0. 05), especially in extrahepatic <b>duct</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (p< 0. 05). The incidences of other genetic alterations (LOH at 9 p, 17 p, and 18 q, and K-ras mutations) showed similar rates with both tumour types.
