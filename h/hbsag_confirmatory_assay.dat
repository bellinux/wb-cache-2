40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{detection}} of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) {{is an important}} aid in the diagnosis of patients infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). A multi-center {{study was conducted to}} characterize the performance of the HBsAg assay on the family of Access immunoassay systems from Beckman Coulter. METHODS: The Access HBsAg assay was characterized in a multi-center study and compared to the Abbott AxSYM* and PRISM* HBsAg assays. The bioMérieux VIDAS* assay was used to resolve discrepant results. Reproducibility studies (intra-assay, inter-assay and inter-lot) were performed with pooled serum samples (negative sample, close to cut off, low, medium and high positive samples). Analytical sensitivity, subtype and genotype detection were studied with various commercial panels (SFTS panel, WHO 80 / 549, WHO 00 / 588, Teragenix HBV Genotype panel). A panel of recombinant HBsAg mutant proteins was tested to investigate reactivity towards genetic mutations. Clinical sensitivity was verified with seroconversion panels and samples from subjects with known HBV infection. Analytical specificity was studied with samples from patients with potential cross-reactive infections. Clinical specificity was validated among blood donors and a hospitalized population. RESULTS: The imprecision was < 10 %. Analytical sensitivity was < or = 0. 1 ng/mL (SFTS panel), 0. 020 PEI Units/mL (ad panel), 0. 024 PEI Units/mL (ay panel), 0. 092 IU/mL with WHO 80 / 549 and 0. 056 IU/mL with WHO 00 / 588. All genotype samples and HBsAg mutants were reactive with the Access HBsAg assay. Seroconversion panels tested showed no significant difference with the reference method. Sensitivity for subjects with known HBV infection was 100 %. No interference with potentially cross-reactive infections was observed after confirmatory testing. Specificity was 99. 96 % (100 % after confirmatory testing) in a blood donor population and 99. 5 % (100 % after confirmatory testing) in a hospitalized population. Excellent separation of positive and negative populations was observed.

30|$|The {{screening}} and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> cut points were statistically determined {{based on the}} current industry white papers (Jani et al., 2015; Shankar et al., 2008). A screening cut point was derived from 50 treatment-naive ALL patients (BioreclamationIVT) by targeting a 5 % false-positive rate to minimize potential false-negatives.

For the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> <b>confirmatory</b> cut point was calculated by testing serum samples from 50 treatment-naive patients with ALL (BioreclamationIVT). The serum samples were incubated with an excess amount of InO before analysis in a competitive binding format (Jani et al., 2015). For each sample, the percentage inhibition values in the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> were calculated. The <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> cut point was derived from the 99 th percentile of the log-transformed normalized RLU values from each plate.

40|$|Background: Early and {{accurate}} diagnosis of HIV {{is important for}} treatment, follow up and decrease the transmission of HIV. CLSI M 53 -A guideline no longer recommends using Western Blot for confirmation of HIV reactive results due {{to the number of}} false-negative and indeterminate results it yields. The objective of this literature review is to systematically review the performance and operational characteristics of HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> that meet the CLSI M 53 -A guidelines. Method: “PubMed” and “EMBASE” databases were used to conduct a systematic literature review and identified the potential relevant publications after June 2011. Publications related to the performance and operational characteristics of HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> applicable to the CLS M 53 -A guideline were retrieved, evidence were compelled and synthesized. Findings: Performance characteristics: sensitivity analysis for individual <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> were as follow: 100 % for recomLine HIV- 1 /HIV- 2; 100 % for INNO-LIA HIV I/II; 95. 3 %- 100 % for Geenius HIV 1 / 2; 100 % for RIBA HIV- 1 / 2; and 98. 3 %- 100 % for Multispot. Specificity analysis for individual confirmatory assays: 98. 1 % for recomLine HIV- 1 /HIV- 2; 91 %- 100 % for INNO-LIA HIV I/II; 93. 4 %- 100 % for Geenius HIV 1 / 2; 100 % for RIBA HIV- 1 / 2; 99. 1 % for Multispot. Operational characteristics: INNO-LIA HIV I/II, recomLine HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 and RIBA HIV- 1 / 2 did not offer much advantage against rapid WB from the operational perspective. Geenius HIV- 1 / 2 and Multispot are much faster and user friendly assay with the same performance as compared to Western Blot and other HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays.</b> Conclusion Overall, the five <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> reviewed had excellent sensitivity, specificity and differentiation ability when compared to WB. Geenius HIV 1 / 2 and Multispot exhibit operational advantages of fast processing time and simple testing procedure.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{investigate}} {{the utility of}} a prototype rapid <b>confirmatory</b> HIV <b>assay</b> which offers specific results in 5 min and has applications {{in a variety of}} important testing situations. Methods: The performance of the rapid <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> was assessed with 849 blood samples, including serum, plasma, venipuncture whole blood, and peripheral blood collected via fingerstick. Included were over 700 HIV Western blot (WB) -confirmed antibody positive sera, and others which were classified as negative or indeterminate by WB. The analytic sensitivity of the rapid <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> was assessed using 13 HIV- 1 seroconversion panels, and all results were compared to those of an FDA-licensed WB reference test. Results: The rapid test exhibited 100 % concordance with the reference test when testing HIV- 1 W 13 -confirmed positive samples, and 92. 3 % concordance with samples having WB-inconclusive results. The sensitivity for confirming recent seroconversion was as good, or better than, the FDA-licensed HIV- 1 WB in 1013 panels. The rapid assay performed accurately with whole blood collected from fingerstick, and exhibited excellent precision and reproducibility. Conclusion: We conclude that this rapid HIV <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> the first of its kind, demonstrates proof of principle for the accurate confirmation of HIV- 1 infection and offers important advantages in public health and clinical testing venues...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{addressed}} the interesting findings of supplemental evaluation of hepatitis B "seroyield" donors. Materials and Methods: Each blood donor sample was tested for anti-human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) /HIV type II (HIV-II), HBsAg, and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence method {{and subjected to}} individual donor-nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV-I, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HCV. NAT test was performed using the eSAS system, Procleix Ultrio Assay, Novartis Diagnostics, CA, US. Confirmation of HBsAg was done using <b>HBsAg</b> <b>Confirmatory</b> Kit (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Johnson & Johnson, USA) and viral load assessment was done using Cobas TaqMan real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA). To provide information {{on the stage of}} infection, specimens were tested for anti-HBc total (IgG + IgM), anti-HBc IgM and HBeAg. HBeAg-negative samples were tested for anti-HBe antibody. Results: A total of 60 hepatitis B seroyield donors which showed mean initial sample/cutoff of 1. 6 with enhanced chemiluminescence assay were investigated further for confirmation of disease status. All 60 cases were confirmed positive with neutralization <b>assay</b> (VITROS <b>HBsAg</b> <b>Confirmatory</b> Kit) while no target was detected on viral load assessment with RT-PCR.

Primary clinical specimens yielding N. gonorrhoeae- or C. trachomatis-specific luminescent values between 100, 000 and 1, 000, 000 were repeat tested in duplicate. A subset of specimens was forwarded for <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> (Gen-Probe) individualized for alternative N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis targets. An 18 -month audit revealed that 230 of 29, 977 C. trachomatis screens (0. 8 %) and 41 of 29, 064 N. gonorrhoeae assays (0. 1 %) yielded low-positive data. When a subset of 40 low-positive N. gonorrhoeae screens was repeat tested, 20 (50. 0 %) remained positive; 22 (55. 0 %) of the screens remained positive following performance of the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> In contrast, repeat testing of 153 low-positive C. trachomatis screens yielded a positive result for fewer specimens (n = 97; 63. 4 %) than when commercial confirmatory testing was used (n = 124; 81. 0 %). However, confirmation of the results for additional C. trachomatis screens by use of an alternative target did not translate into significant differences in the calculated overall C. trachomatis-positive screen rates (7. 39 % by repeat testing versus 7. 52 % by the confirmatory assay; P = 0. 53). Furthermore, use of the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> raised the positive predictive value only 1. 8 % over that of repeat testing.

40|$|Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, has {{historically}} represented {{one of the}} significant neglected tropical diseases on the planet in terms of socio-economic impact. The discovery that ivermectin was a safe and effective treatment for onchocerciasis, together with {{the decision of the}} manufacturer to donate the drug for the treatment of this disease became the basis for several large international programs to control and eventually eliminate the infection. These programs have managed to virtually eliminate transmission of the parasite causing Onchocerca volvulus from many foci in Africa and the Americas. Verifying that transmission has been halted requires sensitive and specific assays to detect the presence of the parasite. The gold standard to accomplish this has been to employ a PCR assay targeting a specific repeated sequence family encoded in the genome of O. volvulus to screen for the presence of the parasite in pools of vector black flies. While this assay is highly sensitive, obtaining the high specificity required to document an absence of transmission requires an independent <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay.</b> To meet this need, an independent PCR assay targeting the cytochrome B (cytB) gene of the O. volvulus mitochondrion was developed. This assay could detect O. volvulus mitochondrial DNA purified by magnetic bead capture using the primers for the cytB gene and from the nuclear encoded repeated sequence DNA targeted in the primary assay. These preliminary data suggest that the mitochondrial PCR assay may be employed as a <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> to detect O. volvulus in pools of vector flies...|$|R

A total of 2780 samples, including 1306 HIV-positive, {{were included in the}} analysis. HIV testing algorithms were designed using Determine as a first test. Second and third rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were selected based on site-specific performance, adhering where possible to the WHO-recommended minimum requirements of sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 99 %.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{in detail}} the effect of infection or vaccination on the human immune system, ELISpot assays are used to simultaneously test the immune response to {{a large number of}} peptides of interest. Scientists commonly use "peptide pools", where, instead of an individual peptide, a test well contains a group of peptides. Since the response from a well may be due to any or many of the peptides in the pool, pooled assays usually need to be followed by <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> of a number of individual peptides. We present a statistical method that enables estimation of individual peptide responses from pool responses using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for "incomplete data". We demonstrate the accuracy and precision of these estimates in simulation studies of ELISpot plates with 90 pools of 6 - 7 peptides arranged in three dimensions and three Mock wells for the estimation of background. In analysis of real pooled data from 6 subjects in a HIV- 1 vaccine trial, where 199 peptides were arranged in 80 pools if size 9 or 10, our estimates were in very good agreement with the results from individual-peptide <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays.</b> Compared to the classical approach, we could identify almost all the same peptides with high or moderate response, with less than half the number of confirmatory tests.

A large-scale screening effort entailing 338, 740 compounds was conducted in a cell-based, phenotypic screen for inhibition of capsule biogenesis in UPEC. The primary and concentration-response assays yielded 29 putative inhibitors of capsule biogenesis, of which 6 were selected for further studies. Secondary <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> identified two highly active agents, named DU 003 and DU 011, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 1. 0 µM and 0. 69 µM, respectively. <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> for capsular antigen and biochemical measurement of capsular sugars verified the inhibitory action of both compounds and demonstrated minimal toxicity and off-target effects. Serum sensitivity assays demonstrated that both compounds produced significant bacterial death upon exposure to active human serum. DU 011 administration in mice provided near complete protection against a lethal systemic infection with the prototypic UPEC K 1 isolate UTI 89. This work has provided a conceptually new class of molecules to combat UPEC infection, and future studies will establish the molecular basis for their action along with efficacy in UTI and other UPEC infections...|$|R
40|$|Screening assays for Neisseria gonorrhoeae exhibit low {{positive}} predictive values, {{particularly in}} low-prevalence populations. A new real-time PCR assay that detects and identifies individual Neisseria spp. using melt curve analysis {{was compared to}} two previously published supplementary assays. NsppID, a 16 S rRNA real-time PCR/melt curve assay developed to distinguish N. gonorrhoeae from other Neisseria spp., was compared to real-time PCR assays targeting genes reportedly specific for N. gonorrhoeae, the cppB gene and the porA pseudogene. A total of 408 clinical specimens (324 female endocervical swabs and 84 male urine or urogenital swab specimens) were screened using the COBAS Amplicor assay for Chlamydia trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) followed by confirmatory testing via real-time PCR. The NsppID assay detected Neisseria spp. in 150 / 181 COBAS-positive specimens (82 %), including six dual infections, and identified N. gonorrhoeae in 102 (56 %) specimens. Sixty-nine of 181 (38 %) specimens were positive for N. gonorrhoeae by porA pseudogene, and 115 / 181 (64 %) were positive for cppB. However, cppB was also positive in 15 % of COBAS-negative specimens, more than either NsppID (4 %) or porA pseudogene (2 %) assays. The porA pseudogene assay had the highest specificity for both genders but the lowest sensitivity, especially in female specimens. NsppID had a slightly lower specificity but greater sensitivity and overall accuracy. The least desirable <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> was cppB, due to poor specificity. The NsppID assay is an accurate <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> for N. gonorrhoeae detection. In addition, the NsppID assay can identify the non-N. gonorrhoeae species responsible {{for the majority of}} false-positive results from the COBAS Amplicor CT/NG assay...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe CLSI-M 53 -A, Criteria for Laboratory Testing and Diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection; Approved Guideline {{includes}} an algorithm in which samples that are reactive on a 4 th generation EIA screen proceed to a supplemental assay that {{is able to}} confirm and differentiate between antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. The recently CE-marked Bio-Rad Geenius HIV- 1 / 2 <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>Assay</b> was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} the FDA-approved Bio-Rad Multispot HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 Rapid Test which has been previously validated for use in this new algorithm. MethodsThis study used reference samples submitted to the Canadian – NLHRS and samples from commercial sources. Data was tabulated in 2 × 2 tables for statistical analysis; sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, kappa and likelihood ratios. ResultsThe overall performance of the Geenius and Multispot was very high; sensitivity (100 %, 100 %), specificity (96. 3 %, 99. 1 %), positive (45. 3, 181) and negative (0, 0) likelihood ratios respectively, high kappa (0. 96) and low bias index (0. 0068). The ability to differentiate HIV- 1 (99. 2 %, 100 %) and HIV- 2 (98. 1 %, 98. 1 %) Ab was also very high. ConclusionThe Bio-Rad Geenius HIV- 1 / 2 <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>Assay</b> is a suitable alternative to the validated Multispot for use in the second stage of CLSI M 53 algorithm-I. The Geenius has additional features including traceability and sample and cassette barcoding that improve the quality management/assurance of HIV testing. It is anticipated that the CLSI M 53 guideline and assays such as the Geenius will reduce the number of indeterminate test results previously associated with the HIV- 1 WB and improve the ability to differentiate HIV- 2 infections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDetecting and characterizing of anti-drug {{antibodies}} (ADA) {{against a}} protein therapeutic are crucially important {{to monitor the}} unwanted immune response. Usually a multi-tiered approach that initially rapidly screens for positive samples that are subsequently confirmed in a separate assay is employed for testing of patient samples for ADA activity. In this manuscript we evaluate the ability of different methods used to classify subject with screening and competition based <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays.</b> We find that for the overall performance of the multi-stage process the method used for confirmation is most important where a t-test is best when differences are moderate to large. Moreover we find that, when differences between positive and negative samples are not sufficiently large, using a competition based confirmation step does yield poor classification of positive samples...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is {{the most}} common {{significant}} chronic viral infection world-wide. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been the principal target for laboratory testing to identify active infection by HBV. We aimed to find out diagnostic validity of the Liaison chemiluminescent method compared to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for HBV detection in the routine clinical diagnostic laboratory. Materials and Methods: From 350 patients suspicious of having infection with HBV, serum samples were separated and used for testing HBsAg by two methods of Liaison chemiluminescent immunoassay, with <b>HBsAg</b> <b>confirmatory</b> test and PCR method. Results: According to the PCR results as assumed as gold standard method with 100 % sensitivity and specificity, detection rate sensitivity of chemiluminescent with confirmatory test was 96 % and its specificity was 100 %, and for chemiluminescent without confirmatory test sensitivity and specificity were 100 % and 70 %, respectively. Also for chemiluminescent with confirmatory test, positive predictive value (PPV) was 100 % and its negative predictive value (NPV) was 97 %, compared to chemiluminescent without confirmatory test with PPV and NPV equal to 71 % and 100 %, respectively. Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that in the majority of the HBV cases, the diagnostic value of chemiluminescent method compared to the PCR method is acceptable, except in low indexes positive cases that need further investigation with the PCR method...|$|R
30|$|Inotuzumab {{ozogamicin}} was conjugated with ruthenium (II) trisbipyridine, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (TAG; MSD, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 20 : 1 ratio or with biotin at a 15 : 1 ratio {{according to}} the manufacturer’s instructions. Rabbit (Rb) anti-G 544 and anti-calicheamicin polyclonal antibodies were used as positive controls (PCs). For the screening assay, high and low PCs were prepared using Rb anti-G 544 serum at 1 : 75 and 1 : 750 dilutions, respectively, in the assay matrix. Affinity purified antibodies were used for sensitivity testing during validation. For the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay,</b> 2 PCs (Rb anti-G 544 and Rb anti-calicheamicin) were used. For cut point determinations, 50 samples of ALL human serum were procured from BioreclamationIVT (Westbury, NY) and stored at −[*] 70  °C until analysis.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{assess whether}} false {{positive}} results found {{when the first}} stage Chlamydiazyme test is performed on urinary sediment could be reduced by using the more specific second stage blocking assay. METHODS [...] Sediment from 173 urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infection caused by Gram negative bacteria and 23 control urine samples were tested using the Chlamydiazyme assay system, which included a blocking assay. RESULTS [...] A reaction result with the first stage Chlamydiazyme assay test was seen in 102 (58. 9 %) of the test urine samples. First stage reactivity was not blocked by the Chlamydiazyme <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> performed on repeat testing. All were correctly identified as true negative (first test false positive) results. CONCLUSIONS [...] Use of a second (specific) blocking assay {{for the analysis of}} urinary sediment using Chlamydiazyme eliminates false positive results in Gram negative urinary tract infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} of specific, confirmatory {{tests in the}} identification of seized illicit products was highlighted by the analysis of eighteen heart shaped, blue tablets confiscated by Police at a street control in the North East of Italy. The tablets responded as amphetamines to a preliminary color test (Marquis); a subsequent, <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed the presence of two anabolic androgen steroids (AAS), methandienone and methyltestosterone, in concentration of 1. 7 and 1. 5 mg respectively per tablet; no trace of amphetamine-like or nitrogen containing compounds was found. The observed orange coloration was due to the reaction of concentrated sulphuric acid, contained in the Marquis reagent, with the Δ 4 C- 3 keto group of steroids. The two AAS, banned under the world antidoping code, are not considered as psychoactive drugs of abuse in most countries, although their trafficking may entangle severe public health concerns...|$|R
30|$|Maternal cell {{contamination}} {{is a major}} troublesome {{obstacle to}} cytogenetic analysis of POC. In an earlier study, about 30  % of the first trimester miscarriage specimens with 46,XX karyotypes, diagnosed by conventional karyotyping, proved to have male karyotypes by additional polymerase chain reaction assay or FISH analysis (Bell et al. 1999). In order to minimize maternal contamination, it is extremely important to completely separate chorionic villi from maternal tissues (Lathi and Milki 2002). In spontaneously discharged POC, however, accurate identification of chorionic villi is often difficult due to extensive tissue degeneration. Indeed, two of 15 miscarriage specimens were suspected to be contaminated with maternal DNA by GDA analysis and the additional STR analysis revealed that two of three normal female cases contained mostly maternal DNA. Thus, the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assay</b> should be additionally performed to evaluate maternal contamination, especially in the specimens with normal female array results. DNA extracted for array-CGH is also applicable for STR analysis.|$|R
40|$|A {{recombinant}} protein {{derived from the}} gp 21 region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) env gene was synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified protein was free of contaminating bacterial proteins and retained reactivity with human HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-positive sera and a gp 21 monoclonal antibody. An immunoblot procedure using the recombinant polypeptide in conjunction with native viral proteins was more sensitive than the conventional immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation <b>confirmatory</b> <b>assays</b> for detection of antibodies to HTLV-I and HTLV-II env-encoded gene products. The {{recombinant protein}} was equally reactive with sera from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HTLV-I or HTLV-II infections. Furthermore, {{on the basis of}} the differential reactivities of gp 21 -positive sera with the HTLV-I p 19 and p 24 gag-encoded proteins, an algorithm was proposed to distinguish exposure to HTLV-I from exposure to HTLV-II. These results establish the utility of a modified immunoblot assay incorporating a recombinant envelope polypeptide as an alternative to existing HTLV-I-confirmatory assays...|$|R
