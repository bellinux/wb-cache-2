50|$|In 1928, Technicolor {{started making}} their prints by the {{imbibition}} process, which was mechanical rather than photographic {{and allowed the}} color components to be combined {{on the same side}} of the film.

50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, <b>hardening</b> the <b>gelatin</b> in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively <b>harden</b> the <b>gelatin.</b> A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|R

50|$|Technicolor re-emerged as a {{three-color process}} for {{cartoons}} in 1932 and live action in 1934. Using a different arrangement of a beam-splitter cube and color filters behind the lens, the camera simultaneously exposed three individual strips of black-and-white film, each one recording {{one-third of the}} spectrum, which allowed virtually the entire spectrum of colors to be reproduced. A printing matrix with a <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin</b> relief image was made from each negative, and the three matrices transferred color dyes into a blank film to create the print.|$|E
50|$|The third {{layer is}} the gelatin binder {{that holds the}} silver grains of the {{photographic}} image. Gelatin has many qualities that make it an ideal photographic binder. Among these are toughness and abrasion resistance when dry {{and its ability to}} swell and allow the penetration of processing solutions. The fourth layer, called the overcoat, supercoat, or topcoat, is a very thin layer of <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin</b> that is applied on top of the gelatin binder. It acts as a protective layer, providing superior abrasion resistance to the print surface.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third stage}} (usually the next day) is {{to expose the}} film {{positive}} to the sensitized gravure tissue. The positive is placed {{on top of the}} sensitized sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue. The sandwich is then exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. A separate exposure to a very fine stochastic or hard-dot mezzotint screen is made, or alternatively an aquatint grain of asphaltum or rosin is applied and fused to the copperplate usually before the exposed gelatin tissue is adhered to the plate. The UV light travels through the positive and screen (if used) in succession, each time <b>hardening</b> the <b>gelatin</b> in proportion to the degree of light exposed to it.|$|R
50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an opaque paint, portions of the image where color was to be applied were blocked out. A duplicate negative was made from the painted print and developed in a tanning developer, which <b>hardened</b> the <b>gelatin</b> layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye transfer machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|R
40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to settle the}} potential problems of bias caused by too soft earplugs and poor formation of the growth layers in age readings of common minke whales. Thus, we examined the feasibility of a new technique of incorporating gelatin in order to collect earplugs for age assessment. Frozen sectioning and histology of the earplug core were also used as methods to improve age estimation. Earplugs were collected by filling the space in the external auditory meatus with <b>gelatin,</b> <b>hardening</b> the <b>gelatin,</b> earplug and its fragments, by spraying with cooling gas, and removing the earplug embedded in gelatin. In 174 trials with common minke whales in the Western North Pacific of coastal waters of Japan in 2007 – 2009, {{it was revealed that}} embedding earplugs with gelatin minimized breakage and protected the neonatal line (NL). This method was particularly effective in younger animals. As a result, the readability was improved. We also examined the histological sections, which were sliced using the Kawamoto specialized frozen sectioning technique, and stained them separately with toluidine blue, haematoxylin and eosin, Sudan III, Sudan VII, and alizarin red S to display a clearer core surface image of the growth layers. The histological sections stained with alizarin red S provided the clearest images, in which we could easily identify both dark and pale laminations. This suggested a close relationship with the seasonal changes in calcium intake from feeding. Earlier age estimation methods focused on fat content in the growth layers; however, we found potential for an improvement in the readability of unclear growth layers when focusing on calcium...|$|R
5000|$|In the lab, skip-frame {{printing}} {{was used}} to sort the alternating color-record frames on the camera negative into two series of contiguous frames, the red-filtered frames being printed onto one strip of specially prepared [...] "matrix" [...] film and the green-filtered frames onto another.

The result was two strips of relief images consisting of <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin,</b> thickest in the areas corresponding to the clearest, least-exposed areas of the negative.|$|E
5000|$|Fiber-based (FB or Baryta) {{photographic}} papers {{consist of}} a paper base coated with baryta.

[...] Most fiber-based papers include a clear <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin</b> layer above the emulsion which protects it from physical damage, especially during processing. This is called a supercoating. Papers without a supercoating are suitable for use with the bromoil process. Fiber-based papers are generally chosen as a medium for high-quality prints for exhibition, display and archiving purposes. These papers require careful processing and handling, especially when wet. However, they are easier to tone, hand-colour and retouch than resin-coated equivalents.|$|E
50|$|The sheet had a {{thin layer}} of gelatin onto which was added a black pigment and it was {{sensitized}} to light. The photographer obtained his copies under a process based on the principle that in the parts of the image receiving less light the gelatin would remain soft whereas in the parts of the image receiving more light the gelatin would become hardened. The treatment of the copy - bathing in water and sawdust - dissolved the unhardened gelatin together with the pigment onto it revealing a white zone underneath, while the <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin</b> resisted the bathing process, trapping the pigment inside and subsequently producing black areas. In this way the image on paper was exposed. But furthermore this printed image with the paper still wet, could be retouched using brushes and cotton swabs or scrapers, giving a lot of freedom for creativity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} volume {{hologram}} formation in thick dichromated gelatin fih-ns is given. Using {{the model and}} a few basic film measurements, we can quantify the index modulation vs. exposure curve. The effects of saturation and dynamic absorption i crease during exposure are considered in the generation of spatial harmonics. The effects of exposure with non-unity beam-ratio and multiple incoherent exposures are predicted and experimentally verified. The thick transmission grating diffraction efficiencies resulting from first- and higher-order index modulations are calculated and compared to experiments.

50|$|Silkscreen {{printing}} and photochemical machining originally {{were based on}} gum bichromate photosensitive materials, where exposure to intense ultraviolet light made previously-soluble gum or gelatin colloids insoluble; after exposure, the exposed surface was washed in water and the unexposed coating dissolved, leaving the <b>hardened</b> gum or <b>gelatin</b> to resist {{the passage of the}} silk-screen ink or the metal-etching solution. Offset printing can use either a negative plate, where the hardened, exposed photosensitive coating attracts ink and repels water, or a positive plate, where the exposed photosensitive coating decomposes or exposes the metal, water-attracting surface.|$|R

The well-reproducible indices of the apparent ionization constants, pKa app, of the indicators were calculated by conventional equating the pH values of the bulk aqueous buffer and those of the 'internal' water into the gelatin films.

In contrast to RLG, LA-ICP-MS does not require labeling of the drug compound with a radionuclide. After administration of the Br-containing drug and a sufficient delay time to allow drug uptake and distribution, the sacrificed animal was frozen and embedded in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), after which thin sections were obtained using a microtome. For quantification purposes, <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin</b> films on a glass support were used as "matrix-matched" Br standards. The limit of detection (LOD) for Br estimated using one of these in-house made standards was 0. 1 mu g g(- 1), which is sufficiently low to allow visualization of Br in the main organ of interest (lung). LA-ICP-MS analysis via single spot drilling with a wider laser beam diameter on the organ of interest was performed as well. In this case, quantification was accomplished via external calibration versus droplets of standards containing the pure drug that were co-embedded with the rat. Figures of merit achievable with LA-ICP-MS were critically evaluated and compared to those typical for the traditional technique, based on the use of radionuclides...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} attributes of the gravure process {{is its ability to}} print a variable ink film by virtue of cell depth variation. This cell depth variation is achieved {{through the use of a}} diffusion resist. All diffusion resists are negative-working and, after exposure, require transfer to plate or cylinder. A 2 ̆ 2 negative-working 2 ̆ 2 resist is one where the emulsion becomes insoluble to the developing solution in those areas struck by actinic radiation. Presently available resists, which are directly applied to plate or cylinder prior to exposure, are not capable of controlling cell depth variation. Thus, the tone range obtainable in the print is limited. This sacrifice has been justified by advantages inherent in the direct system, such as ease of application and seamless image capability. It has long been recognized, however, that a direct system capable of variable cell depth control would be most advantageous. The purpose of this study is to examine the possible application of a radiation-sensitive/positive-working iron salt system for use as a direct diffusion resist. 2 ̆ 2 Positive-working 2 ̆ 2 refers to an emulsion which becomes soluble in those areas struck by actinic radiation. The is sensitized by immersing it in a potassium dichromate solution, and is then dried in the dark. The concentration of dichromate ranges from 2. 5 to 5 percent. The time of immersion varies with the temperature, the pH, and the strength of the bath. The water content of the gelatin before sensitizing is also most important. In general practice, gravure tissues are immersed in the dichromate bath for approximately three minutes. 2 ̆ 2 Carbon tissue is a long-scale process which can accurately reproduce a tone range of 1. 30 to as much as 1. 50 without going into the under- or over-exposed regions of the 2 photographic reproduction curve. 2 ̆ 2 Despite many disadvan tages associated with the instability of dichromated colloid layers, no other radiation-sensitive material has been found, up to the present, which can do the job so well. The sensitized and dried pigment paper is then exposed behind a photogravure screen which consists of opaque squares separated by narrow, clear lines (about 150 to 175 lines to the inch). The clear lines are usually about 1 / 3 the width of the opaque squares which they separate. The effect of this screen exposure is to form a network of insoluble lines of <b>hardened</b> <b>gelatin.</b> The next step is to print the screened tissue behind a continuous- tone positive transparency. This results in a negative resist in which the shadows are represented by gelatin hardened to only a historical roots of this concept are explored and the results of empirical tests explained.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) {{have many}} favorable properties that support their clinical use as bone defect repair. However, {{it is difficult}} to deliver to the required site and hard to compact adequately due to inherently low ductility of ceramics. The aim of this study focused on the effect of the gelatin content on properties of CPCs. The diametral tensile strength, morphology, and weight loss of gelatin cements were evaluated after immersion in physiological solution, in addition to setting time. The results indicated that the setting time significantly increased with increasing gelatin amount. The 2 wt. % gelatin could make CPCs attain the maximum strength value of 2. 1 MPa at 15 -day immersion, while 1. 6 MPa for the cement without gelatin.

40|$|The {{research}} made in {{the field}} of recording materials for holographic applications has yielded to materials of improving quality. Photographic emulsions have {{played an important role in}} this investigation, since although this is the first material used for recording purposes, there are a series of characteristics that convert the photographic emulsion in a very interesting material for holographic recording. In this work we will present the optimisation of a reversal bleaching process. This process has been largely used for Agfa 8 E 75 HD emulsions, but there is still a significant lack of information about it when used with BB- 640 emulsions. There are some differences between BB- 640 and Agfa 8 E 75 HD emulsions such as the degree of <b>hardening</b> of the <b>gelatin,</b> the mean grain size or the emulsion thickness. These differences must be taken into account in order to use the same chemical procedures commonly used for Agfa plates with BB- 640 ones. For instance, one of these differences, the mean size of the silver halide grains present in the emulsion, influences directly in the scattering of the final hologram recorded in the emulsion. It will be demonstrated that the use of ultra-fine grained emulsions, such as BB- 640, allows obtaining holograms with high diffraction efficiencies and low absorption and scattering. In particular, in this work a reversal bleach procedure will be optimised for diffraction gratings recorded with different spatial frequencies on BB- 640 emulsions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Malonaldehyde, a three carbon dialdehyde, {{is one of}} the {{numerous}} carbonyl compounds associated with oxidative deterioration of food lipids. It is assumed to be formed as a product of lipid autoxidation occurring according to the generally accepted free radical mechanism. This compound is of great interest because of its potential high reactivity and its wide occurrence in autoxidized lipids. Malonaldehyde may participate in eliciting some of the adverse biological and chemical effects of in vitro and in vivo lipid autoxidation. In this investigation a micro 2 -thiobarbituric acid analysis for malonaldehyde in various biological materials was developed; the acute toxicity, subacute toxicity and associated physiological responses were determined; and the reaction of malonaldehyde with glycine and protein was investigated. The single oral median lethal dose (LD₅₀) of malonaldehyde administered to rats as the ethoxy derivative, 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetraethoxy propane, and the enolic sodium salt, sodium beta-oxyacrolein, was found to be 527 mg (slope function 1. 67) and 632 mg (slope function 1. 23) per kg body weight respectively. The LD₅₀ of malonaldehyde determined with sodium beta-oxyacrolein was the more accurate estimation of its acute toxicity. Subacute feeding of rats malonaldehyde as the ethoxy derivative, 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetraethoxypropane, and as the sodium salt of the enamine derivative of glycine, sodium N-prop- 2 -enal amino acetate, elicited a series of similar varied and marked anatomical, physiological and/ or biochemical changes over control animals. Ingested malonaldehyde was largely metabolized or altered so that it was no longer detectable by reaction with 2 -thiobarbituric acid. It was distributed throughout the body and particularly in the blood and glandular tissue. Dietary malonaldehyde was found to be concentrated in erythrocytes where it had apparently reacted in vivo with the intracellular protein, tentatively with hemoglobin. A decreased growth rate, a lowered diet utilization, varying degrees of anemia, increased organ weights, symptoms of various vitamin deficiencies, and abnormal nitrogen and tryptophan metabolism were observed. Histomorphological damage to liver tissue included a lytic necrosis of parenchymal cells, increased parenchymal cell and nuclear size, bile ductular proliferation with vacuolation of parenchymal cytoplasm with cyst formation. The response to dietary malonaldehyde probably involved both a dirept toxic action at the cellular level and an interaction with some fraction(s) of the diet altering its nutrient value. The reaction of malonaldehyde with glycine was found to yield the enamine, N-prop- 2 -enal amino acetic acid. The reaction was shown to conform to a S [subscript n] 2 mechanism. The rate of the reaction was shown to be highly dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration. The maximum observed reaction rate was found near pH 4. 20. A postulated mechanism for the reaction involves the nucleophilic 1, 4 -addition of the amino nitrogen of glycine to the end carbon atom of the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system of the enol of malonaldehyde. The reaction of malonaldehyde with bovine plasma albumin was shown to involve the e-amino lysine and N-terminal amino aspartic acid functions as judged by their loss to reaction with 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 - dinitrobenzene. The rate of the reaction was dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration with a maximum observed reaction rate near pH 4. 30. Malonaldehyde did not appear to participate in an intermolecular cross-linking reaction as judged by the lack of viscometric <b>hardening</b> of <b>gelatin</b> sols. Presumptive evidence for the reaction of malonaldehyde, derived from autoxidized lipids, and the ε-amino lysine functions of bovine plasma albumin was obtained. A postulated mechanism for the reaction of malonaldehyde with protein involves the nucleophilic 1, 4 -addition of the free amino functions on the protein to the end carbon atom of the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system of the free enol to form an enamine linkage...|$|R
