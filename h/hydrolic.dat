40|$|The {{so-called}} "minimum uncertainty" or mu-wavelet {{approach has}} been shown to be very effective. Prior work has shown that using special algorithms based on a mu-wavelet decomposition of a seismic signal allows for arrival detection of various waves on a single-component seismogram with good precision. However, the question of interpretation of the type of wave arriving has not been addressed. The problem lies in the fact that the algorithm detects more than two arrivals even on seismograms with little noise, the peaks corresponding to P and S wave arrivals on the indicator function are not always the strongest, and the peak corresponding to the P wave arrival is not always the first peak detected. We propose to use a signal/noise relationship function in a running window as a weight coefficient of the indicator function obtained using the mu-wavelet transformation, which allows to isolate specifically those arrivals which correspond to significant changes in the signal amplitude. To interpret wave arrivals on linear registration systems (well observation systems for monitoring <b>hydrolic</b> fracturing, ultrasound investigations on models and samples of geological material), an algorithm was also developed to isolate arrivals that best correspond to arrivals on all registration points that have observation systems.

These studies show that the aqueous activity of either a water-base or oil-base emulsion drilling fluid can be adjusted to cause water to enter or be extracted from a low-permeability shale. The relative activities developed at downhole conditions determine the chemical potential driving force that will either support or suppose any <b>hydrolic</b> potential driving force caused by a difference between the borehole pressure and the formation pore pressure. If borehole pressure exceeds the far-field pore pressure, ionic water-base drilling fluids permit water entry and weakening of a shale unless the activity as masured at ambient conditions is far less than that of the shale. Even if water is extracted from the shale, borehole stability {{has been found to be}} reduced. In contrast, oil-base emulsion drilling fluids extract water from a shale and maintain borehole stability if the ambient activity is equal to or less than that of the shale. The use of a nonionic polyol monomer (methyl glucoside) to reduce the activity of fresh water results in a drilling fluid that acts very similar to an oil-base emulsion in extracting water from shale and maintaining borehole stability.

Soil samples were collected and analysed only in the Mengong catchment for different horizons. The C contents exhibited a very heterogeneous distribution in the different soil profiles. The organic C stock was estimated at 32 000 t in soils of this catchment. For the <b>hydrolic</b> year 1998 / 99, the mean annual DOC concentration was 0. 31 mg/litre in the spring and 14. 3 mg/litre in the stream at the outlet of the Mengong catchment. the mean dissolved organic C (DOC) river fluxes were between 4700 and 9300 kg/km 2 per year. In coloured river and swamp waters, DOC fluxes were between 4700 and 9300 kg/km 2 per year, whereas POC fluxes were between 600 and 1400 kg/km 2 per year.

In another part of this research, the systems of energy resistance in special way of Oscillating Water Column (OWC) were explained and one sample model was designed and applied in <b>hydrolic</b> channel at the Sheikh Bahaii building in Azad University, Science and Research Branch. The dimensions of designed flume was considered at 16  1. 98  0. 57 m which had ability to provide regular waves as well as irregular waves with little changing on the control system. The ability of making waves was evaluated in our designed channel {{and the results were}} showed that all of the calculation in designed flume was correct. The mean of error between our results and theory calculation was conducted 7 %, which was showed the well result in this situation. With evaluating of designed OWC model and considering of changes in the some part of system, one bigger sample of this model can be used for designing the energy conversion system model. The obtained results showed that the best form for chamber in exit position of system, were zero degree (0 ) in angle for moving below part, forty and five (45 ) degree in front wall of system and the moving forward of front wall keep in two times of height of wave...|$|E

As respects Collection and dispose of runoff from the rainfall in the river stream in fact are safety, public health and utilities and several flood events in Tehran that in some instances are financial losses and damages to human lives indicate necessity integrate study are about flood in the basins upstream of Tehran. So {{the purpose of this study}} determines areas with highest flood risk in the Farahzad basin. Basin Farahzad is located in upstream of the city of Tehran and the area is 22. 29 km 2. It is located in latitude ' 47 ◦ 35 to ' 5 ◦ 35 north and longitude ' 19 ◦ 51 to ' 21 ◦ 51 east. Considering the fact that phenomena as flooding are affected by many factors that these factors are not certain and exact and these are affecting probabilistic and inconclusive, so a method to Fuzzy model used for the areas in the flood risk. 2 - MethodologyAccording to research purposes, data and information layers slope, profile and planimetric curvatures, elevation, drainage density, distance from the river, landforms and land use were assigned as effective parameters to flooding. To prepare the these data and layers are used the Tajrish topography map with scale 1 : 50000, NI 39 - 3 number, K 551 Series, page 2661 I, Tehran geology map with scale 1 : 100000, Tehran Resource evaluation and land capability map scale with 1 : 250000, satellite image landsat ETM+ and satellite image IRS-LISS III. To analyze satellite images, according to the capabilities Erdas software used according to the capabilities of this software in image processing and modeling also full adaptation with the ArcGIS software. After providing information’s mentioned above and determining kind of their relation with the flood appoint membership function for each of the parameters. After applying membership function to layers in Arc GIS software, all layers have values between zeros to one, then layers entered to fuzzy model. To perform fuzzy technique, it is necessary to use operators as union, Subscription, Gama, algebraic multiplication and sum. In this research Gama, algebraic multiplication and sum is used. In this study used Gama, algebraic multiplication and sum operators. First algebraic sum and multiplication operators applied to the layers which amount of membership is determined, then to find the final map of flood zonation and to adjust prepared maps according to algebraic sum and multiplication are used Gama 0. 9, Gama 0. 7 and Gama 0. 5 operators, more over because field data was not existed to determine the most appropriate Gama in flood zonation, amount of correlation between primary info layers and Gama final maps are concluded in SPSS software. 3 -DiscossionGama 0. 7 Map has had the highest correlation with the primary info layers, therefore Gama 0. 7 Map chose as the final map of flood zonation which is classified in to five levels according to natural break method. Zones with very high risk of flood are located in downstream parts of the basin. Upstream parts of the basin and ridges are provided zones with low risk. As a matter of fact risk of flood becomes more if we move from the upstream parts of the basin to the downstream or south. Most area of the region is related to the zones with low risk of the flood which has 14. 29 square kilometers area and smallest area is related to zones with very high risk of flood (0. 78 square kilometers) and high risk (1. 37 square kilometers). Valleys with concave slopes have the most effective surfaces to produce flooding zones in the basin. These surfaces mostly have slope between 0 to 20 percent and height between 1600 to 1950 meters and located between 0 to 1300 meters distances from rivers. Drainage density of this area is between 6 to 9. These surfaces mostly are located in the Units valley with mid slope and these are covered with trees and plants. Ridges and crests with concave slopes have the lowest effective surfaces to produce flooding zones in the basin. These surfaces mostly have slop between 40 to 60 percent and height between 2300 to 2650 meters and located between 130 to 260 meters distance from rivers. Drainage density of this area is more between 0 to 3. These surfaces are mostly located in mountainous units with high slop and covered with pastures. 4 -ConclusionWith considering final maps of flood zonation and along of static development, construction should be stopped in very high and high risk zones, more over it is Recommended to change the place of traditional restaurants located in this area which did not consider river bank to level with 1700 meters elevation which is computed of final map overlaying with topographic map. Results show the capability and efficiency of this model to flood zonation and probable mistakes and differences occurred in other maps is determined in this model which related to various methods of layers of fuzzy production and the kind of Gama operator. The other property of this model is its capability to use in Arc GIS software. Key words: zonation, flooding, fuzzy, Farahzad, risk. ReferencesBaldassarreG. Di.,Guy Schumann, Paul D.
