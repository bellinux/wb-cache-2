The bridge had earlier been certified as structurally sound with no serious deficiencies detected.|$|E
5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin <b>gusset</b> plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E
25|$|Lace {{knitting}} is {{a traditional}} handicraft. The most distinctive trait of Faroese lace shawls is the centre-back <b>gusset</b> shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back <b>gusset,</b> an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly {{as part of the}} traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.|$|E

In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that since a coat in the suitcase had a front <b>gusset</b> and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the body work is done when the owner is fitted before it is completed. The coat had not been imported, indicating the man had been in the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, when <b>gussets</b> were added for {{room for the}} bust, stays became known as corsets. They also {{lengthened}} to the hip and the lower tabs were replaced by <b>gussets</b> at the hip and had less boning. The shoulder straps disappeared in the 1840s for normal wear.|$|R
40|$|As {{engineers}} {{continue to}} prepare the International Space Station (ISS) for in-orbit assembly in the year 2002, ANSYS software has proven instrumental in resolving a structural problem in the project's two primary station modules [...] Nodes 1 and 2. Proof pressure tests performed in May revealed "low temperature, post-yield creep" {{in some of the}} Nodes' <b>gussets,</b> which were designed to reinforce ports for loads from station keeping and reboost motion of the entire space station. An extensive effort was undertaken to characterize the creep behavior of the 2219 -T 851 aluminum forging material from which the <b>gussets</b> were made. Engineers at Sverdrup Technology, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) were responsible for conducting a combined elastic-plastic-creep analysis of the <b>gussets</b> to determine the amount of residual compressive stress which existed in the <b>gussets</b> following the proof pressure tests, and to determine the stress-strain history in the <b>gussets</b> while on-orbit. Boeing, NASA's Space Station prime contractor, supplied the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model geometry and developed the creep equations from the experimental data taken by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Langley Research Center. The goal of this effort was to implement the uniaxial creep equations into a three dimensional finite element program, and to determine analytically whether or not the creep was something that the space station program could live with. The objective was to show analytically that either the creep rate was at an acceptable level, or that the node module had to be modified to lower the stress levels to where creep did not occur. The elastic-plastic-creep analysis was performed using the ANSYS finite element program of ANSYS, Inc. (Houston, PA). The analysis revealed that the <b>gussets</b> encountered a compressive stress of approximately 30, 000 pounds per square inch (psi) when unloaded. This compressive residual stress significantly lowered the maximum tension stress in the <b>gussets</b> which decreased the creep strain rate. The analysis also showed that the <b>gussets</b> would not experience a great deal of creep from future pressure tests if braces or struts proposed by Boeing were installed to redistribute stress away from them. Subsequent analysis of on-orbit station keeping and reboost loads convinced Boeing that the <b>gussets</b> should be removed altogether...|$|R
500|$|The August 2007 {{collapse}} of the Interstate 35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis brought renewed attention {{to the issue of}} truck weights and their relation to bridge stress. In November 2008, the National Transportation Safety Board determined there had been several reasons for the bridge's collapse, including (but not limited to): faulty <b>gusset</b> plates, inadequate inspections, and the extra weight of heavy construction equipment combined with the weight of rush hour traffic. [...] The I-35 Trade Corridor Study reported that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) expressed concern over bridges on the I-35 corridor due to an expected increase of international truck traffic from Canada and Mexico, with the FHWA listing it as [...] "high-priority" [...] in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Modern cloth diapers {{come in a}} host of shapes, {{including}} preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with {{covers and}} pocket or [...] "stuffable" [...] diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, {{such as the use of}} the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several cloth diaper brands use variations of Procter & Gamble's original 1973 patent use of a double <b>gusset</b> in Pampers.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double <b>gusset</b> folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "unique" [...] {{care for}} {{precision}} and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a {{paradigm of the}} care for quality in luxury products. In particular, {{a lot of attention}} is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece. [...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam <b>gusset.</b> The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut {{from the surface of the}} oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a [...] "slim fit" [...] line.|$|E
