With {{intervals}} of Marshalsea lounging, and Mrs Bangham succession, his small second mother, aided by her trusty friend, {{got him into}} a warehouse, into a market garden, into the <b>hop</b> <b>trade,</b> into the law again, into an auctioneers, into a brewery, into a stockbroker's, into the law again, into a coach office, into a waggon office, into the law again, into a general dealer's, into a distillery, into the law again, into a wool house, into a dry goods house, into the Billingsgate trade, into the foreign fruit trade, and into the docks. But whatever Tip went into, {{he came out of}} tired, announcing that he had cut it. Wherever he went, this foredoomed Tip appeared to take the prison walls with him, and to set them up in such trade or calling; and to prowl about within their narrow limits in the old slip-shod, purposeless, down-at-heel way; until the real immovable Marshalsea walls asserted their fascination over him, and brought him back.|$|E

Most American hops were grown in a belt stretching from Madison to Schoharie Counties in upstate New York. Thus this area attracted brewers who summered in the area, two of which, Henry Clausen and Max Shaefer, built homes in the Village. The New York <b>hops</b> <b>trade</b> disappeared after the first world war, due to the combined effects of competition from Oregon, a hops blight, and the coming of prohibition.|$|R

It contains hundreds of letters between Hedwig Steiner and her sons Louis and Heinrich during World War One. It also includes other correspondence, vital, business, and educational documents, and photographs, {{as well as a}} few pages of a late 18 th or early 19 th-century Haggadah in Hebrew and Judeo-German. Simon H. Steiner (born circa 1826) founded the eponymous <b>hops</b> <b>trading</b> firm in Laupheim, near Ulm. His wife was Emilie née Einstein (1838 -). They had four sons, two of whom, Louis and Samuel, went into their father’s business. Samuel continued the business in New York. Simon’s son, Louis Steiner (1863 - 1911, Laupheim) married Hedwig née Reinemann (1868, Chicago – 1952) in 1893. They had two sons, Heinrich Steiner (1895, Laupheim - 1918, France) and Julius Steiner (1898, Laupheim - 1978, New York) who both joined the German army during World War One.

50|$|By 1860, {{the state}} was a leading {{producer}} of hops in the nation. Orleans and Windsor Counties led the state. This crop conveniently arrived {{as a replacement for}} the disappearance of the Merino sheep <b>trade.</b> <b>Hops,</b> too, disappeared. A number of factors were involved: plant disease in 1909, migration of planting to California from 1853-1910, where growing was performed more efficiently, and Prohibition both at the state and national level.|$|R

40|$|We analize {{electrical}} conductivity controlled by hopping of bound spin polarons in disordered solids with wide distributions of electron energies and polaron shifts (barriers). By means of percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations {{we have shown}} that in such materials at low temperatures, when hopping occurs {{in the vicinity of}} the Fermi level, a hard polaron gap does not manifest itself in the transport properties. This happens because as temperature decreases the <b>hopping</b> polaron <b>trades</b> the decreasing electron and polaron barriers for increasing hopping distance. As a result, in the absence of the Coulomb correlation effects, in this variable-range variable-barrier hopping regime, the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature obeys a non-activation law, which differs from the standard Mott law...|$|R

25|$|Bastard {{was born}} in Chigwell to Richard Bastard and Josephine Green. His family were working class; {{his father was a}} <b>hop</b> {{merchant}} by <b>trade.</b> Bastard's family initially ran a merchants shop and drapers in Exeter called Wholesale Linen-Drapers and Hop-Merchants until 1870, when it was dissolved by mutual consent of the family members. A law firm named Segar Bastard & Company was created as a result of Bastard's family ceasing to run the drapers and merchants shop, and Bastard trained and later practised as a solicitor. One of his high-profile clients was Ashanti Goldfields Corporation. Bastard was also on the boards of a number of mining companies; he was listed as a director of Escurial Copper Mines Limited and Tarkwa Main Reef Limited, while also serving as the chairman of Black Eagle Gold Mining Company Limited and Wassan Extended Gold Mines Limited. In June 1884, Bastard married Gertrude Littlewood Garrett in West Ham; they had a daughter named Florence Garrett Bastard.|$|R
40|$|We use {{information}} theoretic achievable rate formulas for the multi-relay channel {{to study the}} problem of optimal placement of relay nodes along the straight line joining a source node and a sink node. The achievable rate formulas that we use are for full-duplex radios at the relays and decode- and-forward relaying. For the single relay case, and individual power constraints at the source node and the relay node, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal relay location and the optimal power allocation to the source-relay channel, for the exponential and the power-law path-loss channel models. For the multiple relay case, we consider exponential path-loss and a total power constraint over the source and the relays, and derive an optimization problem, the solution of which provides the optimal relay locations. Numerical results suggest that at low attenuation the relays are mostly clustered close to the source {{in order to be}} able to cooperate among themselves, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters. The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of impromptu ("as-you-go") placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, with exponential path- loss, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over hops. The <b>hop</b> cost <b>trades</b> off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the optimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process, for which we prove results for the value function, and provide insights into the placement policy via numerical exploration.

40|$|We use {{information}} theoretic achievable rate formulas for the multi-relay channel {{to study the}} problem of as-you-go deployment of relay nodes. The achievable rate formulas are for full-duplex radios at the relays and for decode-and-forward relaying. Deployment is done along the straight line joining a source node and a sink node at an unknown distance from the source. The problem is for a deployment agent to walk from the source to the sink, deploying relays as he walks, given that {{the distance to the}} sink is exponentially distributed with known mean. As a precursor, we apply the multi-relay channel achievable rate formula to obtain the optimal power allocation to relays placed along a line, at fixed locations. This permits us to obtain the optimal placement of a given number of nodes when the distance between the source and sink is given. Numerical work suggests that, at low attenuation, the relays are mostly clustered near the source {{in order to be able}} to cooperate, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters. We also prove that the effect of path-loss can be entirely mitigated if a large enough number of relays are placed uniformly between the source and the sink. The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of as-you-go placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, and with the exponential path-loss model, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over hops. The <b>hop</b> cost <b>trades</b> off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the optimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process, establish results for the value function, and provide insights into the placement policy and the performance of the deployed network via numerical exploration.

In the early 18th century Devizes held the largest corn market in the West Country of England and also <b>traded</b> <b>hops,</b> cattle, horses and various types of cloth. Before the Corn Exchange was built in 1857, the trade in wheat and barley was conducted in the open, with sacks piled around the market cross. Today's cross displays the salutary tale of Ruth Pierce, accused of cheating some buyers at the market: [...] On Thursday the 25th of January 1753, Ruth Pierce of Potterne in this County, agreed with three other women to buy a sack of wheat in the market, each paying her due proportion towards the same. One of these women, in collecting the several quotas of money, discovered a deficiency, and demanded of Ruth Pierce the sum which was wanting to make good the amount. Ruth Pierce protested that she had paid her share, and said, ‘She wished she might drop down dead if she had not.’ She rashly repeated this awful wish; when to the consternation and terror of the surrounding multitude, she instantly fell down and expired, having the money concealed in her hand. The coroner, John Clare, recorded {{that she had been}} [...] "struck down dead by the vengeance of God." ...|$|R
40|$|The memoir "A Walk Through My Life" {{is divided}} into three parts. The first section is {{entitled}} "From Birth through World War I to World War 2 ", part two is called "World War 2 ", and part three "The Years from 1946 - 2002 ". At the end is a short section - "Memorial" - which gives room to his family to honour the legacy of their grandfather and father after his death, with additional prayer texts and songs. After an introduction to the family brewing business, the memoir covers Frederick Landmann's years of education and apprenticeship, then his business travel for the family brewing supplies business to the Far East. He describes the rise of Hitler in Germany and all the obstacles and persecution this brought to his family, leading to his flight from the country in 1938. The memoir then describes New York during World War 2, and Mr. Landmann's efforts to secure his living, then talks about his time at the US Army and the War crime trials at Nuremberg. Back in the USA, he rejoins his family and continues his career in the brewing industry. Frederick E. Landmann was born in Moscow, Russia, on August 23, 1907. His father's business <b>traded</b> <b>hops</b> and other brewing supplies. The family moved to Germany in 1914, and his father was interned as a German prisoner of war in Russia. Frederick E. Landmann went to high school at the "Realgymnasium", then worked as a volunteer apprentice at a bank in Nuremberg from 1925 until 1926. He stayed in the USA from 1926 until 1928, working for a textile company, and acquring the first customer for the family business, H. Landmann Sons, which he started working for in 1931. He left Germany on August 18, 1939, and went to Sweden, which was officially a business trip. He arrived in New York on October 7 1939, on a ship from Oslo, Norway. He married his wife Constance in 1940 in New York. He joined the US Army in February of 1944, and took part at the War crime trials at Nuremberg working as a translator.
