40|$|A {{particle}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>alloy</b> is {{one type}} of metal-ceramic composite material, and is used as heat resistance material, wear resistance material, and electrical material. This material consists of a metal matrix and dispersed particles, and for its unique structure it has both tenacity as a metal and hardness as a ceramic. Its properties improve when the particles become finer and disperse more uniformly. Most of the particle dispersion alloys are produced by the powder metallurgical process. This process is favorable for uniform dispersion of particles, but it consists of complicated techniques such as mechanical alloying and hot extrusion, and has the following drawbacks: (1) {{it is difficult to}} fabricate large-sized products; (2) the amount of particles is limited to a few percent; and (3) the process is complicated and expensive. To overcome these drawbacks, recently special {{attention has been paid to}} conventional melting process. However, under terrestrial conditions, dispersions separate immediately due to the different specific gravities of the metal matrix and the particles and thermal convection effects. The microgravity environment is, therefore, considered to be an attractive place for fabricating the <b>dispersion</b> <b>alloy.</b> This space experiment is carried out to clarify the influence of microgravity on the properties of the particle <b>dispersion</b> <b>alloy</b> and to obtain a deeper understanding of the experiment under the microgravity environment...|$|E
40|$|We {{will now}} {{summarize}} the conclusions from parts I, II and III of this study. A test procedure {{has been developed}} that provides a simple, quick, and nondestructive means of monitoring the in vitro growth of S mutans {{in the presence of}} amalgams and alloys. The spectrophotometric readings are related in a simple way to growth expressed as dry weight of bacteria and metabolic products. Results are expressed as growth relative to controls which represent bacteria growing under identical conditions but not in contact with metals. The %RA 60 value that represents growth after 60 hours relative to controls is used as a measure of growth in the presence of alloys or amalgams. Spherical, fine cut, and dispersion alloys were studied as well as amalgams prepared from these alloys. The <b>dispersion</b> <b>alloy</b> inhibits growth less than the spherical alloy which in turn inhibits growth less than the fine cut alloy. The results for amalgams prepared from the alloys are reversed. At an aging time of two hours, <b>dispersion</b> <b>alloy</b> amalgams inhibit growth more than spherical alloy amalgams and fine cut alloy amalgams. Aging time of amalgams greatly influences the growth inhibition. Immediately after trituration growth is inhibited, but this inhibition is lost with aging. Different types of amalgams seem to lose growth inhibition at different rates. Hg composition in the range of 48 to 52 % seems to have little effect on growth inhibition. It remains for clinical studies, which are concerned with the incidence of secondary caries associated with amalgams, to demonstrate that the age and nature of the amalgam are significant...|$|E

The layers generated had a thickness of 1. 5 mm with Al contents of 30 wt. %. For dispersion alloyed layers, TiC was added with particle sizes of 20 … 100 µm. At a sliding distance of 20 m, the wear rates of alloyed layers (150 HB) and dispersion alloyed layers (180 HB) were almost the same and could be reduced by half compared to the untreated AZ 91 D (60 HB). Due to their large size and the large spaces between them, TiC particles were pressed into the layer matrix, or were torn out and acted as additional abrasives.

Information on the mechanism of forming TiC dispersoids during milling and heating at various temperatures was obtained by using X-ray diffraction and TEM investigations.

Rupture was intergranular and the rupture ductility as measured by percentage elongation was generally low, with values ranging from 0. 5 to 16 pct. The creep properties are rationalized by describing the creep rates in terms of an effective stress which is the applied stress minus a resisting stress consistent with the alloy microstructure.
