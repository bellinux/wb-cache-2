What did he care if he spent all he <b>had?</b> <b>A</b> <b>guy,</b> he admonished himself, just had to have coin when he was goin' with a girl like Miss Istra. At least seven times he darted up from the door-step, where he was on watch for her, and briskly trotted as far as the corner. Each time his courage melted, and he slumped back to the door-step. Sending for money--gee, he groaned, that was pretty dangerous.|$|E

5000|$|On September 11, 2006, {{a lawsuit}} was filed that alleges that a minor was given alcohol {{to drink and}} {{allegedly}} was filmed exposing her breasts, kissing another female and writhing against a pole while Buckcherry performed the song at the video shoot, which was later to be proven false. According to the lawsuit, the music video was posted on the band's website and distributed widely online, as was a [...] "behind the scenes" [...] program that referred to the girl's first name, featured more nudity and had band members saying, [...] "It's like watching seven hours of porn". Skip Miller of law firm Miller Barondess said, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> at the door checking IDs, and to get in, this girl had to show a fake identification showing she was over 18. There were signs telling minors to stay out. This woman filled out a release form with false information. And once it was determined this woman was underage, the video was removed". However, the lawsuit alleges that the minor was not asked for identification. Allen Kovac, Buckcherry's manager, said, [...] "There was every opportunity for her {{not to be in}} that video. For whatever reason, the girl subverted those efforts, and now her mom is trying to blame everyone but her. This woman is now looking at them as a profit opportunity." [...] A representative of Warner Music Group said it had no role in the video's original production, but that when the music company was contacted by the girl's mother, it immediately re-edited the video to exclude her and removed the original from circulation, hiring an outside group to strip it from websites that had posted it illegally.|$|E

5000|$|The Beatles' naivete and {{inability}} {{to keep track}} of their own accounts was also eagerly exploited by the employees of Apple, who purchased drugs and alcoholic beverages, company lunches at expensive London restaurants, and international calls made regularly on office telephones, all of which would be treated as business expenses. Writers Alan Clayson and Spencer Leigh described the owners' hopelessness in managing their own creation: Out of his depth, a Beatle might commandeer a room at Saville Row, stick to conventional office hours and play company director until the novelty wore off. Initially, he'd look away from the disgusting realities of the half-eaten steak sandwich in a litter bin; the employee rolling a spliff of best Afghan hash; the typist who span out a single letter (in the house style, with no exclamation marks!) all morning before 'popping out' and not returning until the next day. A great light dawned. 'We had, like, a thousand people that weren't needed,' snarled Ringo, 'but they all enjoyed it. They were all getting paid for sitting around. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> there just to read the tarot cards, the I Ching. It was craziness". Aspinall finally agreed to direct the company on a temporary basis, simply so that someone would finally be in charge. When, in 1969, the Beatles engaged Klein as their manager, he also inherited the chairmanship of Apple Corps, which led to an immediate streamlining of company affairs: [...] "Overnight, glib lack of concern deferred to pointed questions," [...] wrote Clayson & Leigh. [...] "Which typist rings Canberra every afternoon? Why has so-and-so given himself a raise of 60 pounds a week? Why is he seen only on payday? Suddenly, lunch meant beans-on-toast in the office kitchen instead of Beluga caviar from Fortnum & Mason".|$|E

At {{this point in the}} late 1950s, Kirby was drawing science fiction / fantasy stories followed by giant-monster tales in what collectors and historians call [...] "pre-superhero Marvel" [...] comics, primarily Journey into Mystery, Strange Tales, Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish. As Lieber recalled of those creature features, Stan made up the plot, and then he'd give it to me, and I'd write the script. Tudor City <b>had</b> <b>a</b> park, and when it was nice I'd sit there and break the story down picture by picture. I was unsure of myself just sitting down to write a script. Since I knew how to draw, I'd think, 'Oh, this shot will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> coming this way ... this shot will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> looking down on him,' and later I'd sit at the typewriter and type it up.
