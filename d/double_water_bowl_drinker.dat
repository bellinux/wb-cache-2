40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) calculate aggressive interactions around the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> and to (2) determine preference for a <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> location when pigs were offered either one, two or three <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Information is available on the current drinker to nursery pig’s ratios (drinker: pigs). In the UK producers are recommended 1 : 15, while in the US it is 1 : 10 for nursery pigs. A total of 225 crossbred were seven weeks of age. Conventional nursery pens had plastic flooring and all pigs had ad-libitum access to a commercially formulated diet. Water was delivered through a single stainless steel <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> and was provided ad libitum. All pigs received a natural light cycle from a curtain sided building. Nine pens were used for behavioral measures. Three treatments were compared. Treatment one (TRT 1; n = 3) was defined as one <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> per pen. Treatment two (TRT 2; n = 3) was defined as two <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Treatment three (TRT 3; n = 3) was defined as three <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. One day prior to visual recording of drinking behavior, all pigs in a pen were identified with an individual number. One 12 V black and white CCTV camera was positioned over each <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> and behavior was recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days onto a DVR at 1 frame per second. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> for 5 s or longer) was obtained by three experienced observers who viewed the recordings using 24 h mode (5 frame / s) onto the Observer software. Total number of aggressive interactions and length of aggression around the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> over the 6 h period was not (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) different between the treatments. The total amount of time that nursery pigs spent when offered two (F vs. O) <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> in a pen did not (P = 0. 47) differ. However, when pigs were offered three (F vs. O vs. A) <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> in a pen there was a difference (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) for total amount of time spent at all three locations. In conclusion, pigs displayed a <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> preference with the alley location being the least favored however, there were no difference in the number or length of aggressive interactions...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{information}} on the pigs 2 ̆ 7 temporal drinking patterns is essential when delivering water based health products {{because there is a}} risk that not all pigs will visit the drinker adequately and hence, may not have received sufficient vaccine or antibiotics required to protect the animal. Limited research has evaluated drinking visits and water disappearance in nursery pigs. Recent work has begun to investigate the pig to water resource ratio and the placement and type of water delivery systems.;This thesis covers the areas of: (1) drinking behavior of seven week old pigs when water is either withheld for a period of 15 h or provided ad libitum and (2) drinking behavior, aggressive interactions, <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> preference, and performance measures between seven week old nursery pigs when provided a 1 : 25, 1 : 12, or 1 : 8 drinker to pig ratio.;In the first study a total of 194 seven week old PIC (USA) pigs, weighing 22. 98 +/- 5. 38 kg were housed in single sex pens in a commercial nursery facility. Two treatments were compared; treatment one; withheld (WH; n = 4) pigs did not have access to water for 15 h and treatment two, control (CONT; n = 4) pigs had continuous ad libitum access to water. Drinking behavior was recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the nipple-cup drinker for 5 s or longer) was obtained. Total number of visits, visit lengths and water disappearance were analyzed.;This study found that manipulating water access for a period of 15 h affected the number and length of drinking visits to the nipple cup drinker over a 6 h period, with WH pigs spending longer at the water resource and visiting more often than their CONT counterparts. Upon breaking each hour down respectively the differences (P = 0. 0001) were noted in the first hour (0700) after water was restored with the control group making fewer visits (1. 96 vs. 4. 46 +/- 0. 26) and spending less time (18. 08 +/- 4. 04 vs. 64. 44 +/- 4. 02) at the nipple cup drinker when compared to the withholding group. After 60 min of water restoration there were no differences in the number of visits or length of time spent at the nipple cup drinker between treatments. In addition, water disappearance over the observational period was greater for pigs that had water withheld compared to pigs that were in the control treatment.;In the second study a total of 225 crossbred (21 +/- 4 d) gilts weighing 5. 38 +/- 2. 65 kg were used. Nine pens were used for behavioral and performance measures (average daily gain [ADG]), and three treatments were compared. Treatment one (TRT 1; n = 3) was defined as one <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> per pen. Treatment two (TRT 2; n = 3) was defined as two <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen and treatment three (TRT 3; n = 3) was defined as three <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinkers</b> per pen. Drinking behavior, aggressive interactions and <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> preference were recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> for 5 s or longer) was obtained. The total number of drinking visits and visit lengths, number of aggressive interactions and duration, <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> preference, in regards to the length of time spent at each drinker, and performance measures were analyzed.;When offered more places to drink, pigs visited the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> more often (P = 0. 0209) which tended (P = 0. 06) to increase ADG in nursery aged pigs. In addition, pigs displayed a <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>drinker</b> preference with the alley location being the least favored. Additional {{information on}} placement of key resources within a pen to enhance the drinking behavior for the pig is a useful tool for the swine industry and stakeholders when designing water delivery systems to enhance pig well-being and overall profitability.;Water functions, water quality, and water requirements are all essential to the well-being of the individual pig. It has been stated by numerous authors that water is the 2 ̆ 2 forgotten nutrient. 2 ̆ 2 Yet, information regarding water requirements for all stages of pig production, the specifics to optimize water delivery to the pig, water resource location within the home pen and the ratios of pigs to the drinking resource are to date limited. This research provides new information on water management manipulation and <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> placement within a nursery pen that may affect the drinking patterns of the individual pig...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that {{the design of the}} water dispensers can influence the water intake in farm animals. Horses and dairy cows seem to prefer to drink from an open surface whereas sheep and pigs apparently prefer water nipples, probably because of the worse water quality in <b>water</b> <b>bowls.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the preference of dairy goats for water nipples or <b>water</b> <b>bowls.</b> Methods In each of the two experiments (exp. 1, dry goats, exp. 2 lactating goats), 42 dairy goats were allotted into 6 groups of 7 goats. In period 1, the goats had access to a water nipple. In period 2, they had access to a <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> and in period 3 (preference test) they had access to both a water nipple and a <b>water</b> <b>bowl.</b> <b>Water</b> usage and wastage was recorded and water intake (water usage - water wastage) was calculated for each group for the two last days of each period. In experiment 2, water samples from each dispenser were analyzed for heterotrophy germs at 22 °C, Escherichia coli and turbidity. Results Water usage was higher from water nipples than from <b>water</b> <b>bowls</b> both in experiment 1 (dry goats) and experiment 2 (lactating goats). There was however, no difference in water intake from water nipples and <b>water</b> <b>bowls.</b> In the preference test (period 3), the water intake tended to be higher from the water nipple than from the <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> both for the dry goats (exp. 1) and lactating goats (exp. 2). Especially for the dry goats, the differences between groups were large. Turbidity and heterotrophy germs were much higher in the samples from the <b>water</b> <b>bowls</b> than from the water nipples. Water wastage from the <b>water</b> <b>bowls</b> was negligible compared to the water nipples. From the water nipples the water wastage was 30 % and 23 % of water usage for the dry and lactating goats respectively. Conclusions We conclude that type of water dispenser (nipple or bowl) was probably of minor importance for water intake in goats, but <b>water</b> <b>bowls</b> had a lower water quality. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT.

Aversion studies were performed {{in which the}} magni-tude of applied current was set at a level having a fixed relationship to the sensitivity of individual animals. In the first experiment, response to a steady 60 Hz stimulus continuously applied to a <b>water</b> <b>bowl</b> (steady−continuous) was compared with response to a 10 −cycle 60 Hz stimulus pulsed once per second (pulsed−continuous). No differences between responses to these two treatments were evident. In the second experiment, responses to pulsed−continuous stimulus, to a 10 −cycle 60 Hz stimulus applied to the <b>water</b> <b>bowls</b> once every 10 min (pulsed−intermittent), and to a single event of pulsed current (single− pulse) were compared to a control group receiving no current. Only the pulsed−continuous treatment produced a response {{significantly different from the}} control. The pulsed−continuous treatment increased the delay to drink and inhibited water consumption over both 4 and 8 h intervals for current exposures ranging from 6 to 15 mA peak.
