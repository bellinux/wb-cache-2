5000|$|Scheidt's loan spell at Corinthians {{came to an}} end in 2002, and he {{maintained}} his hope of making it at Celtic, informing the Sunday Herald that [...] "I want this year {{to be known as the}} Scheidt year". [...] However, he no longer met UK work permit requirements and Celtic paid off the remainder of his contract. He then returned to Brazil, joining Atlético Mineiro. [...] A year later he signed for Botafogo, before being released by them in 2006. Scheidt won three caps for Brazil in 1999 shortly prior to his transfer to Celtic.

25|$|The Royal Navy {{was well}} {{prepared}} for the renewed conflict, with a squadron of ships {{of the line and}} numerous frigates based at the Jamaica station, the Navy's western Caribbean base, under Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth. On 18 June 1803 two squadrons were sent to enact a blockade of the principal northern ports in French <b>hands,</b> <b>Cap</b> Français to the east and Môle-Saint-Nicolas to the west. The first squadron, which cruised off Môle-Saint-Nicolas consisted of the 74-gun ships of the line HMS Cumberland under Captain Henry William Bayntun, HMS Goliath under Captain Charles Brisbane and HMS Hercule under the acting command of Lieutenant John B. Hills. The second squadron, assigned to the blockade of Cap Français, was commanded by Commodore John Loring in HMS Bellerophon and included HMS Elephant under Captain George Dundas, HMS Theseus under Captain John Bligh and HMS Vanguard under Captain James Walker. Loring's force was accompanied by the frigates HMS Aeolus under Captain Andrew Fitzherbert Evans and HMS Tartar under Captain John Perkins.|$|R
40|$|Many U. S. states limit {{awards for}} noneconomic damages in {{malpractice}} cases. Proponents often {{argue that such}} tort reform increases physician supply and access to care. However, {{the degree to which}} marginal changes in malpractice liability affect physician supply is theoretically ambiguous. If patients bear the full incidence of cost changes and market demand is inelastic, then tort reform will not affect physicians' net income or location decisions. I use county-level, specialty-specific annual counts of physicians from 1970 - 2000 to estimate the effect of damage caps on physician supply. The results suggest that caps do not affect physician supply for the average resident of states adopting reforms. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>caps</b> appear to increase the supply of frontier rural specialist physicians by 10 - 12 percent. This is likely because rural doctors face greater uninsured litigation costs and a more elastic demand for medical services. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved [...] ...|$|R
