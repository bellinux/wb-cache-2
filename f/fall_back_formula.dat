40|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>back</b> {{equilibrium}} is a {{refinement of}} the Nash equilibrium concept. In the underly- ing thought experiment each player faces the possibility that, after all players decided on their action, his chosen action {{turns out to}} be blocked. Therefore, each player has to decide beforehand on a back-up action, which he plays in case he is unable to play his primary action. In this paper we introduce the concept of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium and show that the set of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of Nash equilibria. We discuss the relations with other equilibrium concepts, and among other results it is shown that each robust equilibrium is <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> and for bimatrix games also each proper equilibrium is a <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that for bimatrix games the set of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is the union of finitely many polytopes, and that the notions of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium and strictly <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium coincide. Finally, we allow multiple actions to be blocked, resulting in the notion of complete <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium. We show that the set of complete <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of proper equilibria. ...|$|R
