40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of a monetary policy shock on the skill premium and the un-employment persistence. A VAR demonstrates that a contractionary policy induces a lagged decline in the skill premium and a larger and more persistent increase in the unemployment ratio of the unskilled relative {{to that of the}} skilled. A new Keynesian framework characterized by labor search frictions is developed. The labor force is divided into high and low educated. Firms post two types of vacancies: the complex that can be matched with the high educated, and the simple that can be matched with both the high and the low educated. A positive shock to the nominal interest rate induces the high educated unemployed to compete with the low educated, as they increase their search intensity for simple vacancies. As the high educated occupy simple vacancies, they crowd out the low educated into unemployment. This <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the subsequent crowding out of the low educated into unemployment, provide a possible explanation to unemployment persistence and the response of the skill premium...|$|E

40|$|Pennsylvania {{is a state}} whose rural {{cities and}} towns - once prosperous centers of {{manufacturing}} and agricultural production - have seen steady economic declines in these sectors due to macro-economic restructuring. Global economic forces {{have resulted in the}} loss or <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> many local <b>jobs,</b> population declines, the loss of educated youth to growing metropolitan areas, and the abandonment of small businesses from many small downtowns. Despite these trends, most small towns and cities still retain a substantial core of new business activity. These entrepreneurs hold the promise of reviving the lagging local economy by providing new jobs and critical products and services that are targeted to local tastes and needs. Understanding what led them to start a business in a declining area can lead to the development of new strategies to entice more entrepreneurs to locate a business in the area to stimulate local economic development. This report uses interviews with forty-two entrepreneurs in eight small towns across Pennsylvania to understand what specific factors motivated their decision to locate in areas traditionally marked by economic decline. The report reveals the surprising fact that most small town entrepreneurs are not natives, but were attracted to the area for other reasons. The report also explores which factors were more important to the location decision - personal, individualist factors or factors within the local social and physical environment. A conceptual framework of the location decision in Pennsylvania is developed, and real strategies for bolstering local entrepreneurship, especially in areas formerly engaged in manufacturing, are drawn from the findings...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Human Relations and the definitive published version is available at [URL] this article I present a critical reconstruction {{of the concept of}} postfordism, arguing for a regulation-theoretic approach that views Fordism and postfordism not in terms of production models based on a particular labour process but as institutional regimes of competition, within which there are one of four types of generic labour process: high-autonomy, semiautonomous, tightly constrained and unrationalized labour-intensive. I show that over one-third of US employment is in low-autonomy jobs and sketch an analytical framework for analysing job quality. Contrasting the four labour processes with various measures <b>of</b> <b>job</b> quality produces 18 job types that reduce to one <b>of</b> three <b>job</b> quality categories: good jobs, bad jobs and decent jobs. The typology provides a framework for analysing upgrading or <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> four aspects of employment quality within and across the four generic labour processes. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R

Uncomfortable with Trudeau's policies, Ryan left the Liberal Party {{and crossed the}} floor on December 3, 1969 to sit as an Independent MP. In September 1970 he joined the Progressive Conservative caucus. Ryan cited three reasons for leaving the Liberals - the Trudeau government's <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> Canada's {{relationship}} with NATO, the government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China and what Ryan argued was the <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> the status and influence of backbench MPs and ordinary Members of Parliament under Trudeau.|$|R
