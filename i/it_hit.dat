5|$|The {{hurricane}} had {{devastating effects}} on the places <b>it</b> <b>hit.</b> It killed at least 1,000people directly, {{and a total of}} 1,800 people. At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times. Most of the destruction was in Colima and Jalisco. A preliminary estimate of property damage was $280million (1959USD).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Henriette then emerged {{over the}} Gulf of California, and made its second {{landfall}} near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental and its remnants {{went on to}} cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. Damage totaled about $275million (2007MXN, $25million 2007USD). <b>It</b> <b>hit</b> Mexico {{on the same day}} Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two occurrences in which a North Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Rick was the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever {{to make landfall}} in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. <b>It</b> <b>hit</b> almost {{a month after the}} more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E

In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E

When <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> near Panama City, Florida with winds of 115mph (185km/h), it caused at least 23deaths, including five when a lighthouse was destroyed. Many houses were destroyed along its path, primarily along the Florida Panhandle.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> the building.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, David {{brought a}} storm surge of only two-four feet (0.6–1.2 m), {{due to its}} lack of {{strengthening}} and the obtuse angle at which <b>it</b> <b>hit.</b> In addition, David caused strong surf and moderate rainfall, amounting {{to a maximum of}} 8.92 inches (227 mm) in Vero Beach. Though it made landfall as a Category 2 storm, the strongest winds were localized, and the highest reported wind occurred in Fort Pierce, with 70 mph (115 km/h) sustained and 95 mph (155 km/h) gusts.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> power lines during a bombing run.|$|E

5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tanya was not {{considered}} a threat to land, as it did not move through the Azores while a tropical cyclone. The Azores were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105mph (170km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.|$|E
25|$|First, a ray {{is created}} at an {{eyepoint}} and traced through a pixel {{and into the}} scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on {{the colors of the}} first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.|$|R
