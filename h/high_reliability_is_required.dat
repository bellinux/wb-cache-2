Results indicate strong seasonal dependence of PMD on temperature for an optical cable test bed exposed to atmospheric changes, leading to a 16 % increase of a mean PMD value in summer.

Therefore, it is essential that the blower wheel be highly dependable. This is especially true for commercial vehicles where long warranty requirements and <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>are</b> <b>required.</b> Several test and analysis methods were employed to understand the cause of the failure of the blower wheel. Initially, the high-speed burst test was used to expose the effects of temperature and imbalance on the part. Experimental vibration analysis was performed on the blower wheel to show the characteristic natural frequencies. This was compared to the numerical natural frequencies found with a finite element analysis (FEA) software package. The experimental stress values were compared to the numerical stress values. The material analysis showed the material was not degraded during the injection molding process and it was not always meeting specifications for the glass coupling agent. Finally, the failures were compared to the S-N fatigue life curves for 25 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene and 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene material. The study found the root cause of the failures to be a combination of resonance, material issues and fatigue that cause the inlet top ring to break on the blower wheel. Improvements in design, process, and testing are recommended for the blower wheel. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

The FTP is a computing system specifically designed for applications where very <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>is</b> <b>required.</b> Examples of such applications are flight control systems, nuclear power systems, and spacecraft control systems. The FTP performance was analyzed in a hierarchical manner encompassing the hardware, the operating system, and the application.

Analysis at the operating system level revealed that the scheduler took only 3. 2 percent of each 40 ms frame, while the redundancy management software took 10. 4 percent. The application level performance was analyzed via a synthetic workload and a representative flight control model. The estimated throughput for this application was found to be 317. 6 KIPS if not exercising the voter.
