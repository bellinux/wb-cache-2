Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the floor. When he leans over <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach.

25|$|This {{species of}} wasp is not {{particularly}} aggressive. When a young nest is disturbed the foundress will first place her head at the entrance in an alert position. Then she flies quickly around the nest and may fall suddenly to the ground. This falling to the ground has only been observed in Dolichovespula species and its purpose is unclear. When small insects such as ants or spiders crawl on the nest the wasp responds by grabbing them in her mandibles and dropping to the ground. It is usually not necessary for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to keep these insects out of the nest as they are rarely seen to try and enter. Once there are some workers in a young nest the queen and workers cooperate to defend it.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November.

500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but I can think of few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy than the way she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's time for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something totally different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
