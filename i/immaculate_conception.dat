5|$|Contemporary {{painters}} {{are also}} inspired by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's {{paintings of the}} <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.|$|E
5|$|In {{a private}} {{printing}} of 1899, Provost Shadwell lists thirteen Gaudies observed by the College during the 18th century; {{by the end}} of the 19th century all but two, the Feast of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> and the Purification of the Virgin, had ceased to be celebrated.|$|E
5|$|The Copse Road Chapel is an Independent Evangelical Church, {{which was}} built in 1851 and has been {{attributed}} to Foster and Wood of Bristol, who also designed the United Reformed Church on Hill Road.

5|$|Today, <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> {{continues}} to be an active parish in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. It is clustered with Our Lady of Guadalupe parish in Montezuma and St. Theresa, Little Flower of Jesus parish in Rockford; all three churches are part of the St. Marys Deanery.|$|E
5|$|A Canonical Coronation (Latin: Coronatam Canonicus): is a pious {{institutional}} {{act of the}} Pope, {{on behalf}} of a devotion. This tradition still stands in 2015, in 2014 Pope Francis crowned Our Lady of <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of Juquila. Since 1989, the act has been carried out through the authorised decree by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception.</b> Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|The Cathedral of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of the Holy Virgin Mary is a neo-Gothic Roman Catholic Church at Moscow's center, {{that serves}} as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow. Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of only three Roman Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong's {{instructions}} for Portugal were to negotiate an expanded {{treaty with the}} government. They arrived at Santa Apolónia railway station in Lisbon on August 19. Kalākaua was presented with the Grand Cross Order of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of Vila Viçosa during an audience with King Luís I at the Palace of Ajuda, and also attended a bullfight with Luis's father King Ferdinand II at the Pena Palace. When they left Portugal on August 24, Armstrong remained behind to initiate a treaty.|$|E
5|$|He preached and lectured on the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> {{and rose}} to {{seniority}} under the patronage of the Avignon Papacy and King Robert II of Scotland, becoming Bishop of Galloway and the only Franciscan to hold a Scottish bishopric. Thereafter he was a staunch advocate of Avignon Pope Clement VII against the English-backed Urban VI, for whom he engaged in partisan preaching and writing, famously challenging any English bishop to settle the issue by single combat.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, Pope Pius IX, {{with the}} support of the {{overwhelming}} majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> as a Dogma in the Catholic Church. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{also home}} to Our Saviour Institute of Science and Technology, a polytechnic. Some notable {{secondary}} schools in Enugu include the College of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> (CIC) built in 1940, Holy Rosary College (HRC) built in 1943, Colliery Comprehensive Secondary school, Queen's Secondary School, Federal Government College, Royal Crown Academy, Nsukka and the University of Nigeria Secondary school. University Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu, under the university of Nigeria, is another university located in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, there {{continued}} to be isolated examples of Gothic church building, including L. G. Thomson's Reid Memorial Church, Edinburgh (1929–33) and J. Taylor Thomson's St John Renfield Church, Glasgow (1927–31). The most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's Bangour Village Church (1924–30) and L. G. Thomson's Fairmilehead Church (1937). Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie's <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> Church, Fort William (1933–34), and Archibald Macpherson's St Matthew, Rosewell (completed 1926).|$|E
5|$|La Purisima Concepcion de la Virgen Maria Parish Church (also The <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of the Virgin Mary Parish Church), {{commonly}} known as Baclayon Church, is a Roman Catholic Church in the municipality of Baclayon, Bohol, Philippines within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Tagbilaran. Baclayon was founded by the Jesuit priest Juan de Torres and Gabriel Sánchez in 1596, and became the oldest Christian settlement in Bohol. It was elevated as a parish in 1717 and the present coral stone church was completed in 1727. The Augustinian Recollects succeeded the Jesuits in 1768 and heavily renovated the church since then.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} {{to paint the}} Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E
5|$|For {{the month}} {{following}} Scalia's death, his {{chair in the}} Supreme Court chamber and {{the front of the}} bench where he sat were draped with black wool crêpe, with more over the court's entrance, a tradition dating from the death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase in 1873. Flags on the Court's front plaza were flown at half-staff for 30 days. Scalia's body lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court of the United States on February 19, 2016. His son Fr. Paul Scalia celebrated a Catholic funeral Mass and delivered the homily the next day at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> in Washington, D.C. The interment was private, at Fairfax Memorial Park in Fairfax, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{production}} {{increased from}} $40,000 in 1903 to $600,000 in 1904 and $6 million in 1905. This expansion {{and the accompanying}} rise in population drove further productivity. Barnette opened the town's first bank on September 9, 1904. One month earlier, two Catholic priests built the town's first church, <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> Church. Also in 1904, construction of a railroad began in Fairbanks and Chena, its downstream neighbor. Low water on the Chena River prevented steamboats from reaching Fairbanks, so a railroad line was built from the Tanana River at Chena to Fairbanks and the mines north of town. Construction of the Tanana Mines Railroad (later the Tanana Valley Railroad) was finished to Fairbanks on July 17, 1905. Two new banks opened in 1905, as did the city's first greenhouse, and a new $10,000 bridge across the Chena River. In June 1905, the bridge caused the biggest flood in the young city's history when a bridge upstream of it collapsed and the resulting wreckage caught in the bridge and blocked the river's flow. The river rose, flooding the town, and the bridge had to be dynamited to halt the flood. The next year, a fire destroyed most of Fairbanks, and the damage was estimated at $1.5 million. The town was quickly rebuilt, and the town's first hospital, St. Joseph's, {{was built on the}} north bank of the Chena. Because the hospital was run by a Catholic religious order, <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> Church was later transported across the Chena River and placed next to the hospital. In 1907, Barnette's bank was forced to temporarily close due to the Panic of 1907 and legal troubles. A new school was built, which housed 150 students. Other schools were built {{on the north side of}} the Chena River, which was separate from town.|$|E
5|$|Mobile has {{a number}} of {{historic}} structures in the city, including numerous churches and private homes. Some of Mobile's historic churches include Christ Church Cathedral, the Cathedral Basilica of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> Emanuel AME Church, Government Street Presbyterian Church, St. Louis Street Missionary Baptist Church, State Street AME Zion Church, Stone Street Baptist Church, Trinity Episcopal Church, St. Francis Street Methodist Church, Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Saint Matthew's Catholic Church, Saint Paul's Episcopal Chapel, and Saint Vincent de Paul. The Sodality Chapel and St. Joseph's Chapel at Spring Hill College are two historic churches on that campus. Two historic Roman Catholic convents survive, the Convent and Academy of the Visitation and the Convent of Mercy.|$|E
5|$|Significant leaks in {{the roof}} were {{reported}} in 1997 and a massive restoration project took place. This entailed fixing the roof, repainting {{the walls and the}} niche housing the statue of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> replacing tiles, enhancing the lighting and sound system and installing new stained glass windows in the Chapel of Our Lord's Passion, which was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs. The renovation was completed on 8 December 2002 and cost a total of US$1.1 million. The project's success in preserving the building's heritage resulted in the cathedral being given an honourable mention at the 2003 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation and presented with the award on its anniversary in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the facade (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> patroness, on the central niche.|$|E
5|$|A {{new site}} for the cathedral was {{selected}} above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and {{the cornerstone of the}} new church was laid on 8 December 1883. Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects and five years later, construction was completed. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the vigil of the Feast of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> and was blessed one day later. The construction of the cathedral cost US$15,400, and since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938, exactly fifty years after it first opened. The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop Emeritus of Canton; three of the cathedral's altars were also consecrated.|$|E
5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum in one corner of the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{has more}} than 45 public parks within its limits, with some that are of special note. Bienville Square is a {{historic}} park in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District. It assumed its current form in 1850 and is named for Mobile's founder, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville. It was once a principal gathering place for {{the citizens of the}} city and remains popular today. Cathedral Square is a one-block performing arts park, also in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District, that is overlooked by the Cathedral Basilica of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception.</b> Fort Conde is a reconstruction of the city's original Fort Condé, built on the original fort's footprint. It serves as the official welcome center and colonial-era living history museum. Spanish Plaza is a downtown park that honors the Spanish phase of the city between 1780 and 1813. It features the Arches of Friendship, a fountain presented to Mobile by the city of Málaga, Spain. Langan Park, the largest of the parks at , features lakes, natural spaces, and contains the Mobile Museum of Art, Azalea City Golf Course, Mobile Botanical Gardens and Playhouse in the Park.|$|E
5|$|The third {{important}} {{work of this}} period is the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception.</b> The painting, {{to be done with}} the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about , it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.|$|E
5|$|There is no state-prescribed {{religion}} in the country. The religious groups in the urban centre of Bangui, {{in the order of}} their population representation, are the Christians which form the majority, Animists following ancient beliefs, and Muslims. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> under the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bangui is located in Bangui, as is the Church of Fatima. The archdiocese was established as the Apostolic Prefecture of Oubangui Chari on 8 May 1909. Pope John Paul II visited Bangui in August 1985. The seat of the archbishop is Notre-Dame Cathedral in Bangui. Islam is the last in the order of religious beliefs with about 20,000 Muslims in Bangui. However, prior to sectarian violence in the country, more than 100,000 Muslims lived in the capital. The late president Bokassa converted to Islam as a political compulsion under the guidance of the then Libyan President Gaddafi. He also assumed the Muslim name of Sala Eddine Ahmed Bou Kassa, but it was short-lived as he wanted a cathedral to be built in Bangui. The Church of Fatima and Notre Dame D'Afrique are located in KM 5.|$|E
5|$|From 1996 to 1999, {{the church}} was {{restored}} {{with the help of}} sponsors EnergoPol, a Polish company, and Renovabis, a German association for Roman Catholic churches. The Russian government provided funds towards the conclusion of the project. Reconstruction took place initially under the direction of Polish companies PKZ and Budimex, who completely restored the façade and roof. From September 1998, Father Andrzey Stetskevich and Jan Tajchman, architect and restorer from Toruń, Poland, jointly oversaw the work; they had previously headed the restoration of the Catholic Assumption Cathedral in St. Petersburg. (Stetskevich later rose to become vicar general of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow.) The interior fittings and the new altar were built by Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian experts. Companies in Moscow carried out all the internal and external marble work. The church furnishings were produced, under the direction of Vladimir Mukhin, by students from the St. Petersburg renovating school. Stained glass for the façade's rose window were made in Toruń, other windows were produced by Tolotschko, a Belarusian company from Hrodna. The Cathedral of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> was ceremonially reopened on 12December 1999 and was reconsecrated by the Secretary of State of the Roman Curia, Angelo Cardinal Sodano. The cathedral incorporates a library, the editorial office of the Russian Catholic magazine The Catholic Messenger—The Light of the Gospel (Russian: Католический вестник — Свет Евангелия) as well as the local office for the Caritas charity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> School, a co-ed Catholic {{school from}} pre-K to 8th grade. The {{school is a}} local {{landmark}} located on the property of <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> Church and Monastery, run by the Passionist Congregation of priests.|$|E
25|$|Marian doctrines {{featured}} {{prominently in}} 19th century theology, especially {{the issue of}} the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of Mary. During his pontificate, petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception.</b> In 1848 Pius appointed a theological commission to analyze the possibility for a Marian dogma. On 8 December 1854 he promulgated the apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus is an Apostolic constitution defining the dogma of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> is {{commonly}} {{confused with the}} Virgin Birth of Jesus. Jesus's birth is covered by the Doctrine of Incarnation, while the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> deals with the conception of Mary, not that of her son.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July 1914, Pope Pius X {{approved}} {{the request of}} Cardinal James Gibbons to invoke the patronage of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> for the construction site of the National Shrine of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|The 1476 {{extension}} of {{the feast of the}} <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that emblems depicting The <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> began to appear.|$|E
25|$|From an art {{historical}} perspective, {{the depiction of}} the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> involves a number of interesting issues. Many artists in the 15th century faced {{the problem of how}} to depict an abstract idea such as the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years.|$|E
25|$|While Old Catholics do not {{reject the}} <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> of Mary, {{and some of}} their parishes venerate Mary as immaculately {{conceived}} and celebrate the feast of her <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> they do not accept its definition as a dogma, since they reject papal infallibility and with it the Pope's authority to define dogma.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception</b> is a teaching of Eastern origin, but is expressed in the terminology of the Western Church. Eastern Catholics, though they do not observe the Western Feast of the <b>Immaculate</b> <b>Conception,</b> have no difficulty affirming it or even dedicating their churches to the Virgin Mary under this title.|$|E
