We have performed structural {{characterization of the}} above alloys using standard techniques, and analyzed the field dependence of critical current and pinning force density using existing theories. Our results indicate that dislocation networks and point defects like voids and interstitial imperfections are the main <b>flux</b> line <b>pinning</b> centres in the Mo_ 100 -xRe_x alloys in the intermediate fields, i. e., in the small bundle <b>flux</b> line <b>pinning</b> regime. In this regime, the critical current density is also quite robust against increasing magnetic field. In still higher fields, the critical current density is affected by flux creep.

50|$|Superconductors may be {{considered}} perfect diamagnets, and completely expel magnetic fields due to the Meissner effect when the superconductivity initially forms; thus superconducting levitation can {{be considered}} a particular instance of diamagnetic levitation. In a type-II superconductor, the levitation of the magnet is further stabilized due to <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> within the superconductor; this tends to stop the superconductor from moving with respect to the magnetic field, even if the levitated system is inverted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flux</b> <b>pinning</b> is the {{phenomenon}} where a superconductor is pinned in space above a magnet. The superconductor {{must be a}} type-II superconductor because type-I superconductors cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields. The act of magnetic penetration is what makes <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> possible. At higher magnetic fields (above Hc1 and below Hc2) the superconductor allows magnetic flux to enter in quantized packets surrounded by a superconducting current vortex (see Quantum vortex). These sites of penetration are known as flux tubes. The number of flux tubes per unit area {{is proportional to the}} magnetic field with a constant of proportionality equal to the magnetic flux quantum. On a simple 76 millimeter diameter, 1-micrometer thick disk, next to a magnetic field of 28 kA/m, there are approximately 100 billion flux tubes that hold 70,000 times the superconductor's weight. At lower temperatures the flux tubes are pinned in place and cannot move. This pinning is what holds the superconductor in place thereby allowing it to levitate. This phenomenon is closely related to the Meissner effect, though with one crucial difference — the Meissner effect shields the superconductor from all magnetic fields causing repulsion, unlike the pinned state of the superconductor disk which pins flux, and the superconductor in place.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically the {{dynamics}} of sliding charge-density waves (CDWs) {{in the presence of}} impurities in d= 1, 2. The model considered exhibits a first order dynamical transition at a critical driving force $F_c$ between ``rough'' (disorder dominated) $(F F_c) $ sliding phases where disorder is washed out by the external drive. The effective model for the sliding CDWs in the presence of impurities can be mapped onto that of a magnetic <b>flux</b> line <b>pinned</b> by columnar defects and tilted by an applied field. The dynamical transition of sliding CDWs corresponds to the transverse Meissner effect of the tilted flux line. Comment: 14 pages, 5 embedded PostScript figures, 3 separated PostScript figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the peak effect in melt-processed Y- 123 bulk superconductors {{is caused by the}} {{disorder}} transition of <b>flux</b> lines <b>pinned</b> by oxygen deficient regions with lower Tc. In order to study the effect of dimensionality of superconductor on the peak effect, a change in the pinning characteristics by heat treatment at 550 °C was measured. Jc decreased and the peak effect became less pronounced. At the same time, the peak field and the dip field reduced. This shows that the disorder transition of flux lines took place much easier than before the heat treatment. It is speculated that the pinning energy and the transverse flux bundle size reduced due to a change of specimens to more two-dimensional underdoped state...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with effects in damping and Young's modulus observed in YBaCuO ceramic superconductors vibrating ultrasonically either in or without magnetic field. The amplitude and time dependencies which arise {{as a result of}} high amplitude vibrational excitation are presented for coarse-grained and fine-grained specimens. Weak magneto-acoustic effects were observed, and found to be strongly influenced by vibration amplitude and by thermal pre-history of the sample. Analysis of the results shows that, in the vicinity of liquid helium temperature, high amplitude ultrasonic stresses induce structural modifications in these YBaCuO ceramics. Dislocation point defect interaction mechanisms are proposed for explaining the micro-plastic behaviour of the YBaCuO samples observed in the ultrasonic experiments.

50|$|Frozen {{mirror image}} method (or method of frozen images) is an {{extension}} of the method of images for magnet-superconductor systems that has been introduced by Alexander Kordyuk in 1998 {{to take into account the}} magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> phenomenon. The method gives a simple representation of the magnetic field distribution generated by a magnet (a system of magnets) outside an infinitely flat surface of a perfectly hard (with infinite pinning force) type-II superconductor in more general field cooled (FC) case, i.e. when the superconductor goes into superconducting state been already exposed to the magnetic field. The difference from the mirror image method, which deals with a perfect type-I superconductor (that completely expels the magnetic field, see the Meissner effect), is that the perfectly hard superconductor screens the variation of the external magnetic field rather than the field itself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expense of}} {{refrigeration}} {{led to the}} early dismissal of low-temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings. However, high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically. [...] Hybrid bearing systems {{are most likely to}} see use first. High-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs, but can easily provide a stabilizing force. Therefore, in hybrid bearings, permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it. The reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect diamagnets. If the rotor tries to drift off center, a restoring force due to <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> restores it. This is known as the magnetic stiffness of the bearing. Rotational axis vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping, which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets, preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications.|$|E
40|$|The <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> {{properties}} in high temperature superconductors are {{strongly influenced by}} thermally activated flux motion.

The effect of two factors, i. e., the <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> strength and the dimensionality of the material, on these properties are investigated. It is speculated that the irreversibility line in Bi- 2212 superconductors is one order of magnitude smaller than that in Y- 123, even if the <b>flux</b> <b>pinning</b> strength in Bi- 2212 is improved up to the level of Y- 123.
