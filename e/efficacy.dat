40|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{are available}} to men but there are few studies investigating the acceptability of HPV vaccines among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), a high risk group. We assessed the intention to take up HPV vaccines among MSM in Hong Kong and the associated factors related to cognitions on HPV and HPV vaccines, basing on the Health Belief Model (n = 542). The acceptability of HPV vaccines was 20 % (unconditional on <b>efficacies</b> and price), 29. 2 % (conditional on <b>efficacies</b> and market price), 51. 7 % (conditional on <b>efficacies</b> and discounted price) and 79. 1 % (conditional on <b>efficacies</b> and free price). Adjusting for background variables, composite scores of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers and cue to actions were significantly associated with acceptability of HPV vaccines conditional on specific <b>efficacies</b> and the market price. Acceptability of HPV vaccines was highly price sensitive. Future studies need to use conditional measures. Implementation and translational researches are warranted...|$|R

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies.

Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve <b>efficacy</b> and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar <b>efficacy</b> than the existing product.

40|$|A raw extract of {{licorice}} (Glycyrrhiza glabra) {{was tested}} against downy mildew in vegetables under semi-commercial conditions. In two greenhouse trials in cucumber, <b>efficacies</b> of ca. 70 % were achieved (3 % extract concentration) in either 7 or 10 - 11 day application intervals.

In open field trials in lettuce, <b>efficacies</b> after weekly application of 5 % G. glabra extract were variable, depending on disease pressure.

To elucidate these differences, we analyzed fusion proteins of the human H 2 R (hH 2 R) and guinea pig H 2 R (gpH 2 R), respectively, and the short splice variant of Gs (GsS) ex-pressed in Sf 9 cells. The potencies and <b>efficacies</b> of small H 2 R agonists in the GTPase assay and the potencies of antagonists at inhibiting histamine-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by hH 2 R-GsS and gpH 2 R-GsS were similar.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the {{classical}} neuroscience paradigm of Hebbian learning. We {{find that a}} necessary requirement for effective associative memory learning is that the <b>efficacies</b> of the incoming synapses should be uncorrelated. This is difficult to achieve in a robust manner by Hebbian synaptic learning, since it depends on network level information. Effective learning can yet be achieved by a neuronal process that maintains a zero sum of the incoming synaptic <b>efficacies.</b> This normalization drastically improves the memory capacity of associative networks, from an essentially bounded capacity to one that linearly scales with the network’s size. Such neuronal normalization can be successfully carried out by activity-dependent homeostasis of the neuron’s synaptic <b>efficacies,</b> which was recently observed in cortical tissue. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that effective associative learning with Hebbian synapses alone is biologically implausible and that Hebbian synapses must be continuously remodeled by neuronally-driven regulatory processes in the brain.
