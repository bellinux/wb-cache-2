5|$|However, the {{competition}} has had many secondary sponsors {{that invest in}} the tournament as well. Many of these sponsors are nationally based but have expanded to other nations.

5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together.

5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages <b>do.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they <b>do</b> <b>for</b> about an hour after sunset. This may be in order to mate, {{or they may be}} influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might <b>do.</b> <b>For</b> example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E

5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had.

5|$|Later that day, Lane storms into a partners' meeting, {{shouting}} at Pete about how Edwin's wife has {{found out about}} Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> some time.|$|E

5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they <b>do</b> <b>for</b> tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E

5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
5|$|The Advance Guard {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Kehl, and {{marched to the}} northeast. François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had {{appointed}} General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, {{this was the best}} Jourdan could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> him. Vandamme led the Advance Guard through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the advance guard broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.|$|E

5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they <b>do</b> <b>for</b> Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would <b>do</b> <b>for</b> attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
