25|$|Contrary to {{the common}} pejorative {{doctrine}} pertaining to the Old Testament held in some Christian groups that Jewish korbanot were for sins, which is a well known fallacy, their use was far more complex—only some korbanot in mostly one rare restrictive circumstance were used to atone for unintentional sins, and these sacrifices only accompanied the important required core means of atonement to be <b>ever</b> <b>considered</b> legitimate. Besides this one exception, there were {{the overwhelming majority of}} other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations. Korbanot are brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming closer to him. Also, they were brought for the purpose of expressing thanks, gratitude, and love to God.|$|E
500|$|McCain began 2001 by {{breaking}} {{with the new}} George W.

In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts. Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign. Later, when a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords, became an Independent, thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against [...] "self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty". Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain has always adamantly denied that he <b>ever</b> <b>considered</b> doing so. Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, {{to become one of the}} Senate's most influential members.|$|E

Alan Hardy, who asked Minogue to perform at the fundraiser, noticed that she was very nervous in performing. However, the crowd were estatic of her performance. Hardy later asked if she would do another and, to her surprise, she performed [...] "The Loco-Motion", already rehearsing the song before the performance. Minogue went to record the song in Melbourne but could not record the song in the same key as the backing track, so she went to improve her vocals so she could change her pitch to a E minor.|$|E

Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew.

500|$|Chapman {{began the}} 1932 season in good form and {{appeared}} fitter {{than he had}} for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that [...] "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [...] form, would again be given charge of the [...] team." [...] Christopher Douglas believes {{that the difference between}} Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: [...] "Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and, even though it was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} selectors <b>ever</b> <b>considered</b> returning to him. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession.|$|E

500|$|St Vincent's {{skills as}} an {{administrator}} and logistician {{came into play}} and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting [...] "I have <b>ever</b> <b>considered</b> {{the care of the}} sick and wounded {{as one of the first}} duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land." [...] Based on Doctor Baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as [...] "the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself," [...] The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay. Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Harvey took over operational command of the fleet in St Vincent's absence.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Disney {{announced}} that the film's title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name, {{as well as its}} 1998 film adaptation. This led to confusion over the film's actual title. Empire magazine reported that the film would be titled Marvel Avengers Assemble while The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be called simply Avengers Assemble. Marvel's UK website refers to the film as Marvel's Avengers Assemble, although David Cox of The Guardian, in arguing {{that it was one of}} the worst film titles <b>ever,</b> <b>considered</b> this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer. According to the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office, the title is Marvel Avengers Assemble. Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, [...] "The Avengers — formally titled Marvel's The Avengers onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on the posters..." [...] Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that [...] "decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it".|$|E
500|$|Director and screenwriter Steve Kloves {{spent six}} months writing The Fabulous Baker Boys from the {{perspective}} of its three main characters, exploring their relationship with each other. Kloves eventually decided to write the film {{in the form of a}} character study, developing Susie into a [...] "feisty wild card looking for something more from her life." [...] Susie is portrayed by American actress Michelle Pfeiffer, who claims to have first been offered the role five years before production began, only to decline it on several occasions. Despite being one of the most sought-after actresses at the time due to her recent Academy Award-nominated performance in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), some studio executives feared that Pfeiffer was still too obscure to attract a large audience on her own. Having already known her personally, Pfeiffer became the first actor Kloves expressed interest in casting in The Fabulous Baker Boys; he eventually focused on casting real-life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Fabulous Baker Boys once establishing contact with Pfeiffer proved difficult. However, the script continued to struggle without an actress playing Susie. During this time, actress Debra Winger and singer Madonna were both considered for the role, the latter of whom turned it down because she felt the script was [...] "too mushy". Actresses Jodie Foster and Jennifer Jason Leigh had also expressed interest in the part, but Kloves was eventually able to contact Pfeiffer, maintaining that she is the only actress he himself had <b>ever</b> <b>considered</b> for the role. Although the actress enjoyed both the script and character, with whom she identified emotionally, she was hesitant to commit to another role so soon after having just recently completed several film projects in a row, initially intending to go on hiatus after filming Dangerous Liaisons due to exhaustion. Thus, Kloves spent one week visiting Pfeiffer at her home until she finally relented. Prior to The Fabulous Baker Boys, most of Pfeiffer's roles had been rather unglamorous; Pfeiffer claims that she typically avoided playing glamorous characters because she found most of them uninteresting until she discovered Susie. Pfeiffer accepted the role because she [...] "thought [...] was a great woman... someone I really wanted to be like." [...] Film critic Mike D'Angelo, writing for The Dissolve, believes that Pfeiffer decided to accept the role of Susie because she was still embarrassed by her performance in the unsuccessful musical Grease 2 (1982), and wanted to prove that she was in fact capable of playing a character who was a combination of both Sandy Olsson and Betty Rizzo from Grease (1978) at the same time.|$|E
