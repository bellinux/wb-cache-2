In this paper, we adopt smoothing spline methods within a state space framework to smooth data on one- or two-dimensional grids with difficult regions. We make a distinction between two types of missing observations to handle the irregularity of the grid and to ensure that no smoothing takes place over and across the difficult region. For smoothing on two-dimensional grids, we introduce a two-step spline smoothing method. The proposed solution applies to all smoothing methods that can be represented in a state space framework.

This high reaction rate as compared to previous studies in developed countries is probably due to the high moisture content of the waste in which food waste was the main component (> 60 %) combined with a tropical climate which has high precipitation and temperatures. These factors could stimulate anaerobic degradation and produce more biogas in a shorter time after the wastes has been disposed.

Under the new proposed framework, various idiosyncracies can be modeled compactly via a kernel function for each individual time-series, and long-range dependency can be captured by a copula function. The copula function separates the marginal behavior and serial dependency structures, thus allowing them to be modeled separately and with much greater flexibility.

There is a plethora of studies in literature aiming at converting bandlimited seismic data into reservoir properties. Considering previous works, Maureau and Van Wijhe (1979) and Angeleri and Carpi (1982) inferred porosity using the linear link between inverted impedance and porosity log, Doyen et al.

Recently, some authors have shown the importance of deriving reservoir properties simultaneously. Bachrach (2006) and Sengupta and Bachrach (2007) succeed in simultaneously inverting both porosity and water saturation by using stochastic rock physics modeling.

This may be achieved by selecting plots which are naturally homogenous or applying a high rate of Zn fertilizer to Zn deficit plot to homogenize the area. The latter may be done by planting a systematic check cultivar in a given area and developing maps using <b>geo-statistics</b> that show variability for Zn grain concentration. It is important to maintain an adequate amount of available Zn in the soil during the crop growth period and testing the performance of high Zn rice lines over a wide range of environments with different levels of Zn is essential before being released as varieties as most parts of the rice growing areas suffer Zn deficiency.

The formulated and integrated methods were tested with the groundwater quality data set of Bitterfeld/Wolfen, Germany. Spatially, the monitoring network was optimized using geo-statistical methods. Temporal optimization of the monitoring network was carried out using Sen’s method (1968). For geostatistical network optimization, a geostatistical spatio-temporal algorithm was used to identify redundant wells in 2 - and 2. 5 -D Quaternary and Tertiary aquifers.

Ten years climatic data, recorded in 37 different stations, Basilicata morphological characteristics (elevation, slope, etc.) and land cover information have been inputted and processed to develop the proposed method, that takes advantage by <b>geo-statistics</b> (predictive Kriging) and map algebra potentialities that the modern GIS offers. Data have undergone geo-statistical analysis to create predictive layers, that by mean of map algebra operations have generated firstly two intermediate maps (climatic and morphological suitability for greenhouse setting) and then the final map, that shows the suggested Basilicata Region areas useful for greenhouse installation. Results have reported that in Basilicata Region there are two possible district areas suitable for greenhouse allocations in which climatic trends, morphological characteristics and general facilities better fix protected cultivations needs with reference to lower energy inputs...|$|E
40|$|The {{sources of}} water and {{corresponding}} delivery mechanisms to groundwater-fed fens are not well understood due to the multi-scale geo-morphologic variability of the glacial landscape in which they occur. This lack of understanding limits the ability to effectively conserve these systems and the ecosystem services they provide, including biodiversity and water provisioning. While fens tend to occur in clusters around regional groundwater mounds, Ives Road Fen in southern Michigan {{is an example of}} a geographically-isolated fen. In this paper, we apply a multi-scale groundwater modeling approach to understand the groundwater sources for Ives Road fen. We apply Transition Probability <b>geo-statistics</b> on more than 3000 well logs from a state-wide water well database to characterize the complex geology using conditional simulations. We subsequently implement a 3 -dimensional reverse particle tracking to delineate groundwater contribution areas to the fen. The fen receives water from multiple sources: local recharge, regional recharge from an extensive till plain, a regional groundwater mound, and a nearby pond. The regional sources deliver water through a tortuous, 3 -dimensional "pipeline" consisting of a confined aquifer lying beneath an extensive clay layer. Water in this pipeline reaches the fen by upwelling through openings in the clay layer. The pipeline connects the geographically-isolated fen to the same regional mound that provides water to other fen clusters in southern Michigan. The major implication of these findings is that fen conservation efforts must be expanded from focusing on individual fens and their immediate surroundings, to studying the much larger and inter-connected hydrologic network that sustains multiple fens...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to the knowledge of the effects of the climatic trends on the cork oak system and to furnish a base of prediction models related to the wood growth. The area of the study is located in the centre of Sardinia. The area covers an overall surface of 9 Km 2 for the statistic analysis and of 25 Km 2 for the simulation. We have collected the measures of trees with diameter at breast height between 15 and 30 cm. The statistic analysis has concerned: 1) the classification of the statistic variables; 2) the treatment of the satellite images MODIS for the extraction of space- temporal variables related to temperatures at ground level, the water content and the mass vegetation; 3) the definition of the samples with a high possibility of error; 4) Annealing simulation for the optimization of the model and of data. Finally we have create one prediction model for a vast area. The Pearson correlation of show that the average increases of a sample group of trees are tightly tied to thermometric trend. The analysis with <b>geo-statistics</b> technique has brought to verify that there is a clear correlation with the content of water, with the daytime temperature, and with the biomass. While the increases, on the other hand, are negatively correlated with the night-temperatures and the EVI. The results of the simulations have brought, finally, to the possibility to build prediction maps with annual, biennial and cumulative scale...|$|E
