5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, the Chinese government's Ministry of Environmental Protection {{announced}} a new <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> for thermal power plants, for NOx and mercury, and a tightening of SO2 and soot standards. New coal power plants have a set date {{of the beginning of}} 2012 and for old power plants by mid-2014. They must also abide by a new limit on mercury by beginning of 2015. It is estimated such measures could bring about a 70% reduction in NOx emissions from power plants.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the type of}} vehicles entering the ZTL by engine standard with respect to the months of October and November 2007 found {{that there has been a}} change in the composition of the fleet entering the restricted area, with a sharp reduction of older vehicles with lower <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> engines. The number of vehicles subject to the charge fell by 56.4%, representing an average reduction of 21,274 vehicles per day, with a greater variation among auto drivers when compared to commercial vehicles. The number of exempt vehicles grew by 4.3%, for an average increase of 2.248 vehicles a day.|$|E

25|$|Subaru {{launched}} {{the third generation}} Japanese and world-market Legacy in June 1998, while the North American model started production in late 1999 as a 2000 model, {{also known as the}} BE for sedan models and BH for wagons. European-market and Japanese models ranged from a normally aspirated 2.0L flat-4 to the EZ30 flat-6 in the 3.0R model (European and Japanese trim level designation), with the twin turbo that was offered in the previous generation still offered on performance models. In the US market the third generation Legacy went on sale with the 2.5L EJ251 Engine standard. In 2001 the EZ30, a newly designed 3.0L H6 was offered in the Outbacks. The engine now met California's LEV <b>emission</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises {{to clean up the}} city's air, nearly 17nbsp&billion USD was spent. Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes {{for the duration of the}} Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations, and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers), reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles. The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world. Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 <b>emission</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the later}} {{generations of the}} Skyline GT-R, the GT-R is four-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 {{cylinder}} engine and has the signature four round tail lights. However, the GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with its Skyline siblings and is a complete redesign from previous Skylines rather than an incremental evolution; the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for <b>emission</b> <b>standard),</b> carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname Godzilla, given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the charge {{depended}} on the vehicle's engine emissions standard and fees vary from € 2 to €10 on weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free access to the ZTL was granted to several types of alternative fuel vehicles and for conventional fuel vehicles compliant with the Euro3 and Euro4 or better. Residents within the restricted zone were exempted only if driving higher <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> vehicles while owners of vehicles with older more polluting engines a discount only if they buy an annual pass that can go up to €250 depending on the vehicle's engine emission standards. Enforcement is carried out through digital cameras located at 43 electronic gates, with fines for offenders varying between €70 to €275. The Ecopass fee can be paid before entering the ZTL or up to midnight the next day after entering. There are daily and multiple-day passes. Payment of the fee can be made via internet, by telephone, in designated banks or by direct debit to the user's bank account, by first an Ecopass card must be issue at designated places.|$|E
500|$|For the 2008 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden {{announced}} the MY09.5 upgrade involving the standardisation of the [...] "premium" [...] Alloytec V6 across the Commodore range from 1 November 2008, whereas previously {{it had been}} reserved for the SV6 and Calais. Omega and Berlina variants acquired variable valve timing, like the High Output engine, but not the [...] "premium" [...] dual exhaust system and the five-speed automatic transmission. These changes result in the base petrol V6 producing [...] less power and [...] less torque than the engine it replaces. However, Omega and Berlina sedans benefit from a twopercent fuel efficiency improvement, or fourpercent for wagons. Additionally, emissions have also been reduced allowing petrol-powered variants to achieve Euro VI certification, a pending <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> for European introduction in 2014. These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants benefit from an eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG. This reduced fuel consumption does however, come at a cost—LPG-equipped models are rated at , [...] less than before.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} evidence on {{the relevance of the}} Porter hypothesis for automotive <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> It focuses on two channels through which the Porter effect may operate. First, there is evidence that <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for cars have had important effects on innovation at different levels in the supply chain (the “weak” form of the Porter hypothesis), without discernible long-run negative effects in industry performance. However, there is no strong evidence either that regulations lead to an overall increase in productivity (the “strong” version of the Porter hypothesis). Second, there is relatively strong evidence that countries {{are more likely to have}} more stringent domestic vehicular <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> if they export more automobiles and automobile components to countries which themselves have more stringent vehicular standards. There is also (mixed) evidence that countries which receive more inward foreign direct investment in the automotive sector are more likely to have more stringent domestic <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> This suggests that imposing strict <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> may bring some “first mover advantages” to the leading countries, in line with the Porter hypothesis. ...|$|R
