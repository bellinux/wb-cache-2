He proposed to the national government {{the use of a}} new cockade, blue and white. It was approved, so he created a flag of the same colours nine days later. It was first flown on 27 February 1812, next to the Paraná River. The government did not accept the flag, but Belgrano had left to the north, following previous orders. Still unaware about the rejection, Belgrano raised the flag at San Salvador de Jujuy and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution.

5000|$|British {{infantry}} regiments possessed two flags; the King's Colour (the Union flag) {{and their}} regimental colour, which displayed colour of the regiment's facings. In 18th and 19th century warfare 'the colours' often became {{a rallying point}} in the most bitter actions. Both regimental standards were highly regarded {{and a source of}} pride each regiment. However, because of the tactical constraints in conducting the war and the adapted mode of fighting, it is likely that British regiments only used their colours for ceremonial purposes in America, particularly the armies commanded by Howe and Cornwallis. However, {{in the early years of}} the war the Hessians continued to carry their colours on campaign, Major-General Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Lossberg wrote; [...] "They British have their colours with them only when quartered, while we carry them with us wherever the regiments go... the country is bad for fighting. Nothing worries me more than the colours, for the regiments cannot stay together in an attack because of the many walls, swamps, and stone cliffs. The English cannot lose their colours, for they do not carry them with them." [...] During the Saratoga campaign Baroness Riedesel, the wife of a German officer, saved the colours of the Brunswick regiments by burning the staffs and <b>hiding</b> the <b>flags</b> in her mattress.|$|R

5000|$|With {{his talent}} and {{abilities}} now recognized, Shamroy {{landed a job}} through Myron Selznick at 20th Century Fox. He remained at Fox for the next 30 years and enjoyed complete freedom. It was during his tenure there that he developed his technique of using absolute minimum lighting on a set. A film that Shamroy was quite proud of was Wilson (1944), a pacifist film made during World War II. It was never shown to the troops, for obvious reasons. For this picture, natural interiors were used, a rare move in those days. One scene done in the Shrine Ballroom required that the lights be <b>hidden</b> behind <b>flags.</b> It took a hundred men moving arcs around the ballroom. Darryl F. Zanuck was so surprised by the first shots that he kissed Shamroy to the cheers of the staff. With 5,000 people in the blaze of light and hundreds of flags flapping, the re-creation of the Baltimore Democratic Convention of 1912 was a most startling shot on the screen. In Forever Amber (1947), Shamroy shot many of the exteriors in rain. He used liquid smoke hovering over the bodies to achieve a dull, monotonous effect, and showed smoke coming from the doors to suggest something sinister inside. He matched the title, [...] "Forever Amber," [...] by use of amber-colored gelatins.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Array {{comparative}} genomic hybridization (CGH) is {{a technique}} which detects copy number differences in DNA segments. Complete sequencing {{of the human genome}} and the development of an array representing a tiling set {{of tens of thousands of}} DNA segments spanning the entire human genome has made high resolution copy number analysis throughout the genome possible. Since array CGH provides signal ratio for each DNA segment, visualization would require the reassembly of individual data points into chromosome profiles. Results We have developed a visualization tool for displaying whole genome array CGH data in the context of chromosomal location. SeeGH is an application that translates spot signal ratio data from array CGH experiments to displays of high resolution chromosome profiles. Data is imported from a simple tab delimited text file obtained from standard microarray image analysis software. SeeGH processes the signal ratio data and graphically displays it in a conventional CGH karyotype diagram with the added features of magnification and DNA segment annotation. In this process, SeeGH imports the data into a database, calculates the average ratio and standard deviation for each replicate spot, and links them to chromosome regions for graphical display. Once the data is displayed, users have the option of <b>hiding</b> or <b>flagging</b> DNA segments based on user defined criteria, and retrieve annotation information such as clone name, NCBI sequence accession number, ratio, base pair position on the chromosome, and standard deviation. Conclusions SeeGH represents a novel software tool used to view and analyze array CGH data. The software gives users the ability to view the data in an overall genomic view as well as magnify specific chromosomal regions facilitating the precise localization of genetic alterations. SeeGH is easily installed and runs on Microsoft Windows 2000 or later environments. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In 222, Zhu Huan succeeded Zhou Tai as {{the area}} {{commander}} of Ruxu. The emperor of Wei, Cao Pi, initiated a three-pronged attack against Sun Quan, and ordered his Grand Marshal, Cao Ren, to personally take Ruxu fortress. Cao Ren purposefully leaked the news that he would attack Xianxi (羨溪) with the intention to dilute the defensive forces inside the fortress. Zhu Huan fell victim to Cao Ren's strategy and indeed sent his main forces eastward to strengthen Xianxi. At the time, Cao Ren led his several tens of thousands men to Ruxu, Zhu Huan only had 5,000 troops remained inside the city walls. The defenders were scared because they were outnumbered, so Zhu Huan said to them, [...] "whenever two armies fight, the outcome {{is determined by the}} commanders but not the size of forces. You have heard of Cao Ren's military reputation, how is his ability compared to mine? The military doctrine says an invading force should be double than a defending force when they fight on a plain. The condition mentioned is that the defenders do not have a fortress and the morale for both sides is equal. Now Cao Ren is not wise nor brave, his soldiers are faint-hearted, and they have travelled a thousand li, exhausting both horses and men. On the other hand, we occupy a high-walled fortress, which sits to the north of a river and south to a mountain. This is a situation that we have the leisure to prevail over the tired invaders. We will win a hundred battles if situation like this recur one hundred times. We should have no anxiety even Cao Pi comes here in person, why should we worry about the likes of Cao Ren?" [...] Then, Zhu Huan ordered his subordinates to <b>hide</b> the <b>flags</b> and drums to generate an illusion they were weak, in order to lure Cao Ren to attack. Cao Ren sent his son, Cao Tai, to lead the main forces to approach the fortress, and ordered general Chang Diao and Wang Shuang to sneak-attack Middle Island, where defenders' families resided. Zhu Huan sent Yan Gui (嚴圭) to Middle Island and lay traps there, while he led the remaining troops out to battle Cao Tai. Chang Diao and Wang Shuang were ambushed, when they went back to the shore, their ships had already been taken and they could not return. Chang Diao was killed in action and Wang Shang was captured in battle. 1,000 Wei soldiers were drowned when they attempted to flee the battlefield, {{and the rest of the}} detachment had their retreat route sealed. Outside Ruxu fortress, Zhu Huan repelled Cao Tai's attack, and managed to infiltrate the enemy and burned their camps.
