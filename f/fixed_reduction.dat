50|$|Prior to 1931, {{different}} percentage {{charges of}} rates were imposed according to districts. In 1931 the Government recognised the unsatisfactory {{nature of the}} large number of different rates of charge. The absence or presence of amenities in certain localities should have been reflected in the rateable value of the property. Consequently, upon the enactment of Ordinance No. 16 of 1931, a uniform percentage charge of 17% of the rateable value was levied in all rated areas for the services provided by the Government. However, water was still seen to justify separate treatment with a <b>fixed</b> <b>reduction</b> of 1% in the rates percentage charge for premises with unfiltered water supply and 2% for premises with no fresh water supply.

40|$|Abstract. Mobile and {{wireless}} devices like {{cell phones and}} networkenhanced PDAs have become increasingly popular in recent years. The security of data transmitted via these devices is a topic of growing importance and methods of public-key cryptography are able to satisfy this need. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is especially attractive for devices which have restrictions in terms of computing power and energy supply. The efficiency of ECC implementations is highly dependent {{on the performance of}} arithmetic operations in the underlying finite field. This work presents a simple architectural enhancement to a generalpurpose processor core which facilitates arithmetic operations in binary finite fields GF(2 m). A custom instruction for a multiply step for binary polynomials has been integrated into a SPARC V 8 core, which subsequently served to compare the merits of the enhancement for two different ECC implementations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{ray-tracing}} method is developed {{to describe the}} global solar transmittance of louver shading devices. The method is integrated in the dynamic building energy simulation program TRNSYS to assess the cooling demand and required peak cooling power in a south oriented office room.

As the method is quite complex and requires an important computational effort, this research contrasts the results against the performance of simplified modelling and implementation approaches to assess the performance of louver shading devices. The use of view factor models not accounting for reflections in the shading device underestimates the cooling demand and the peak cooling power.

40|$|Constructor {{rewriting}} {{systems are}} said to be cons-free if, roughly, constructor terms in the right-hand sides of rules are subterms of constructor terms in the left-hand side; the computational intuition is that rules cannot build new data structures. It is well-known that cons-free programming languages can be used to characterize computational complexity classes, and that cons-free first-order term rewriting can be used to characterize the set of polynomial-time decidable sets. We investigate cons-free higher-order term rewriting systems, the complexity classes they characterize, and how these depend on the order of the types used in the systems. We prove that, for every k >= 1, left-linear cons-free systems with type order k characterize E^kTIME if arbitrary evaluation is used (i. e., the system does not have a <b>fixed</b> <b>reduction</b> strategy). The main difference with prior work in implicit complexity is that (i) our results hold for non-orthogonal term rewriting systems with possible rule overlaps with no assumptions about reduction strategy, (ii) results for such term rewriting systems have previously only been obtained for k = 1, and with additional syntactic restrictions on top of cons-freeness and left-linearity. Our results are apparently among the first implicit characterizations of the hierarchy E^ 1 TIME != E^ 2 TIME != [...] Our work confirms prior results that having full non-determinism (via overlaps of rules) does not directly allow for characterization of non-deterministic complexity classes like NE.

The aim of our study was to analyze the appearance of autologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies in the sera of HIV-infected individuals. For this purpose, primary strains have been isolated from 18 HIV- 1 -infected subjects prior to seroconversion (in one case) or within 1 to 8 months after seroconversion. Sera, collected {{at the same time}} as the virus was isolated and at various times after isolation, have been analyzed for their ability to neutralize the autologous primary strains isolated early after infection, heterologous primary isolates, and cell-line adapted strains. Our neutralization assay, which combines serial dilutions of virus and serial dilutions of sera, is based on the determination of the serum dilution at which a <b>fixed</b> <b>reduction</b> in virus titer (90 %) occurs. We have shown that (i) we could not detect autologous neutralizing antibodies in sera collected {{at the same time as}} we isolated viruses; (ii) we detected neutralizing antibodies against the autologous strains about 1 year after seroconversion, occasionally after 8 months, but sera were not always available to exclude the presence of neutralizing antibodies at earlier times; (iii) after 1 year, the neutralization response was highly specific to virus present during the early phase of HIV infection; and (iv) heterologous neutralization of primary isolates was detected later (after about 2 years).

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} implicit model for root water extraction {{by a single}} root in a symmetric radial flow problem, based on the Richards equation and the combined convection-dispersion equation, we investigated {{some aspects of the}} response of root water uptake to combined water and osmotic stress. The model implicitly incorporates the effect of simultaneous pressure head and osmotic head on root water uptake, and does not require additional assumptions (additive or multiplicative) to derive the combined effect of water and salt stress. Simulation results showed that relative transpiration equals relative matric flux potential, which is defined as the matric flux potential calculated with an osmotic pressure head-dependent lower bound of integration, divided by the matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions. In the falling rate phase, the osmotic head near the root surface was shown to increase in time due to decreasing root water extraction rates, causing a more gradual decline of relative transpiration than with water stress alone. Results furthermore show that osmotic stress effects on uptake depend on pressure head or water content, allowing a refinement of the approach in which <b>fixed</b> <b>reduction</b> factors based on the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil solution extract are used. One of the consequences is that osmotic stress is predicted to occur in situations not predicted by the saturation extract analysis approach. It is also shown that this way of combining salinity and water as stressors yields results that are different from a purely multiplicative approach. An analytical steady state solution is presented to calculate the solute content at the root surface, and compared with the outputs of the numerical model. Using the analytical solution, a method has been developed to estimate relative transpiration as a function of system parameters, which are often already used in vadose zone models: potential transpiration rate, root length density, minimum root surface pressure head, and soil -h and K-h function...|$|E
40|$|Background Income, air pollution, obesity, {{and smoking}} are primary factors {{associated}} with human health and longevity in population-based studies. These four factors may have countervailing impacts on longevity. This analysis investigates longevity trade-offs between air pollution and income, and explores how relative effects of income and air pollution on human longevity are potentially influenced by accounting for smoking and obesity. Methods County-level data from 2, 996 U. S. counties were analyzed in a cross-sectional analysis to investigate relationships between longevity and the four factors of interest: air pollution (mean 1999 – 2008 PM 2. 5), median income, smoking, and obesity. Two longevity measures were used: life expectancy (LE) and an exceptional aging (EA) index. Linear regression, generalized additive regression models, and bivariate thin-plate smoothing splines were used to estimate the benefits of living in counties with higher incomes or lower PM 2. 5. Models were estimated with and without controls for smoking, obesity, and other factors. Results Models which account for smoking and obesity result in substantially smaller estimates {{of the effects of}} income and pollution on longevity. Linear regression models without these two variables estimate that a $ 1, 000 increase in median income (1 μg/m 3 decrease in PM 2. 5) corresponds to a 27. 39 (33. 68) increase in EA and a 0. 14 (0. 12) increase in LE, whereas models that control for smoking and obesity estimate only a 12. 32 (20. 22) increase in EA and a 0. 07 (0. 05) increase in LE. Nonlinear models and thin-plate smoothing splines also illustrate that, at higher levels of income, the relative benefits of the income-pollution tradeoff changed—the benefit of higher incomes diminished relative to the benefit of lower air pollution exposure. Conclusions Higher incomes and lower levels of air pollution both correspond with increased human longevity. Adjusting for smoking and obesity reduces estimates of the benefits of higher income and lower air pollution exposure. This adjustment also alters the tradeoff between income and pollution: increases in income become less beneficial relative to a <b>fixed</b> <b>reduction</b> in air pollution—especially at higher levels of income...|$|E

Within this context, this paper attempts {{to account for the}} environmental impacts that may arise in relation to a global scenario characterised by low economic growth rates over the next twenty years. To narrow the context of economic development further, we consider the implications for the Australian environment of a possible economic community formed by a number of West Pacific nations. In relation to these possible economic futures an attempt is made to estimate the economic costs required to achieve a range of <b>fixed</b> <b>reductions</b> in environmental stress. This is done by linking, within a model of the global economic system, sets of relationships descriptive of the economic structure and environmental condition in Australia. In effecting this link we consider applications of the polluter-pays principle in which certain pollution abatement measures are required of stress-producing activities. Specifically, this model is used to compute the trade-offs between the reduction of environmental stress and the costs of control in relation to coal developments in the energy sector. The effects of these measures on the Australian economic system, in terms of measures reflecting the standard of living of the population and levels of employment, are then described. The model is also used to throw light {{on the question of whether}} the increase in the production of pollution-control equipment balances the loss of production in the industries responsible for environmental stress. An attempt is also made to address questions on the effectiveness of the polluter-pays principle recently posed on the OECD. ...|$|R
