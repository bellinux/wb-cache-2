5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women. Many critics saw this as a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders {{at the urging of}} the Three Witches within the film.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> {{and replaced}} by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E

5|$|Drusus died {{suddenly}} 14 September 23, seemingly from natural causes. Ancient historians, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, claim he died amid a feud with the powerful Sejanus, Praetorian prefect of Rome. They allege that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered.</b> In their account, Sejanus had seduced his wife Livilla, {{and with the}} help of a doctor she had poisoned Drusus. Despite the rumors, Tiberius did not suspect Sejanus and the two remained friends until Sejanus' fall from grace in 31.|$|E
5|$|In 655, Penda invaded Bernicia {{with a large}} army, {{reported}} to have been 30 warbands, with 30 royal or noble commanders (duces regii, as Bede called them), including rulers such as Cadafael ap Cynfeddw of Gwynedd and Aethelhere of East Anglia. Penda also enjoyed the support of Aethelwald, the king of Deira and the successor of Oswine, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> on Oswiu's orders in 651; Bede says Aethelwald acted as Penda's guide during his invasion.|$|E

5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered.</b> The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|She was {{an elder}} sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, whose alleged {{escape from the}} {{assassination}} of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years. However, it was later proven that Anastasia did not escape. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Maria might have been the grand duchess whose remains were missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near Yekaterinburg, Russia and exhumed in 1991. However, further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial family <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> in 1918.|$|E

5|$|The Arch of Caracalla {{is one of}} Volubilis' most {{distinctive}} sights, situated {{at the end of}} the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> by a usurper.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Nazi Germany announced {{the discovery of}} mass graves in the Katyn Forest in 1943. When the London-based Polish government-in-exile asked for {{an investigation by the}} International Committee of the Red Cross, Stalin immediately severed diplomatic relations with it. The USSR claimed that the victims <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> by the Nazis in 1941 and continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the NKVD, as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered.</b> This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E

5|$|An inquest {{was held}} in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street. The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the {{conclusion}} that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, and that Tucker, Bentley and Choate <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> by Gardstein and others {{in the course of the}} burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.|$|E
5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered</b> at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had}} been killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E
5|$|Lihau died on 9 April 1999 in Boston, {{seven days}} {{after the death of}} his wife in Kinshasa. He was {{initially}} buried in a Boston cemetery before his body was exhumed and entombed in Gombe, Kinshasa, on 12 May. Lihau's family never requested that an autopsy be performed on the corpse. In 2001 Kalokola, ostensibly on behalf of the Lihau family, filed a complaint against unknown persons with the attorney general of Kinshasa, claiming that Lihau <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>murdered.</b> He based his assertion on a strange visit that Lihau supposedly had with someone the day {{after the death of his}} wife and on unusual signs that were observed on Lihau's body when it was brought to Kinshasa.|$|E
