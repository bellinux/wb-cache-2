5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army {{as a real}} threat, {{for the first time}} ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same amount of <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed the core of this massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. They argue that Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While no definitive number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} Confederate armies were {{gathered}} by the Quraysh of Makkah, led by Abu Sufyan, who fielded 4,000 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers,</b> 300 horsemen, and 1,000–1,500 men on camels.|$|E

5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal {{body armour}} (usually {{in the form}} a chain mail cuirass) and helmets, in addition to shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal armour and helmets were probably owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> had only shields and no metal armour or helmets.|$|E
5|$|Not {{in itself}} {{a part of the}} Wars of Scottish Independence, the battle is {{significant}} for its employment of tactics learned in the Scottish wars in a domestic, English conflict. Both the extensive use of <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> rather than cavalry, and the heavy impact caused by the longbow, represented significant steps in military developments.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up {{long enough for the}} Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.|$|E

5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand {{brought more}} than 400 Fussvolk (<b>foot</b> <b>soldiers)</b> and five squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by pillage, arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn their allegiance to Gebhard and would fight to the death for him.|$|E
5|$|While Latour {{battered}} against Ney, Riesch launched {{attacks against}} the 4,100 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers,</b> 2,000 horsemen, and 16 guns belonging to Jean Hardy's division. A brigade belonging to Claude Legrand's division marched up and helped block Riesch's attempt to turn Hardy's flank. During the fighting, a shellburst wounded Hardy and caused him to hand over command to BG Bastoul. With both French divisions being slowly pressed back by superior numbers, Grenier gave orders for a withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery. Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed.|$|E

5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed special taxes on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was hoping}} to gain support from the West, and more {{specifically}} from the Pope. However, the help that he received was modest in numbers. The Hungarian Kingdom sent 1,800 Hungarians, while Poland sent 2,000 horsemen. Stephen recruited 5,000 Székely soldiers. The Moldavian army consisted of twenty cannon; light cavalry (Călăraşi); elite, heavy cavalry – named Viteji, Curteni, and Boyars – and professional <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers.</b> The army reached a strength of up to 40,000, of whom 10,000 to 15,000 comprised the standing army. The remainder consisted of 30,000 peasants armed with maces, bows, and other home-made weapons. They were recruited into Oastea Mare (the Great Army), into which all able-bodied free men {{over the age of}} 14 were conscripted.|$|E
5|$|Ziyadat Allah's {{council was}} divided over the issue, {{but in the}} end the exhortations of the {{respected}} qadi of Kairouan, Asad ibn al-Furat, who used quotations from the Quran to support his case, swayed them. Asad was placed {{at the head of the}} expedition even while retaining his office of qadi, normally incompatible with a military post. The Muslim expeditionary forces is said to have consisted of ten thousand <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> and seven hundred cavalry, mostly Ifriqiyan Arabs and Berbers, but possibly also some Khurasanis. The fleet comprised seventy or a hundred ships, to which were added Euphemius' own vessels.|$|E

5|$|A {{report from}} 9 July 1796 showed that Saint-Cyr's Center had two {{divisions}} under Duhesme and Taponier. In Duhesme's division, Dominique Vandamme's brigade included the 17th Line (2,793) and 100th Line (2,479), 20th Chasseurs à Cheval (254) and 11th Hussars (38). Duhesme's division counted 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry. Taponier's division {{consisted of the}} brigades of Henri François Lambert, Antoine Laroche Dubouscat and Claude Lecourbe. Lambert led the 93rd Line (3,119) and 109th Line (2,769). Laroche directed the 21st Light (2,284) and 31st Line (2,840). Lecourbe commanded the 84th Line (2,692), 106th Line (3,186) and 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval (240). There were a total of 22,162 <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers,</b> 532 horsemen and 433 gunners in Saint-Cyr's wing. However, a 14 June report showed 919 troopers present in Saint-Cyr's command, including the 9th Hussars.|$|E
5|$|Alexander the Great trained his <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{to injure}} {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian {{elephants}} during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of <b>foot</b> <b>soldiers)</b> and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E
5000|$|A common myth is that brigandines were so-named {{because they}} were a popular choice of {{protection}} for bandits and outlaws. This is untrue. Originally the term [...] "brigand" [...] referred to a <b>foot</b> <b>soldier.</b> A brigandine was simply a type of armour worn by a <b>foot</b> <b>soldier.</b> It {{had nothing to do}} with its alleged ability to be concealed by bandits. In fact, brigandines were highly fashionable and were ostentatiously displayed by wealthy aristocrats both in European and in Asian courts.|$|R
