500|$|The {{idea for}} casting the screenwriter Amol Gupte {{came from the}} casting {{director}} Honey Terhan. Gupte {{said that when he}} received a call from Terham, {{he thought it was a}} joke. He stated, [...] "A man named Honey <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Vishal Bhardwaj's casting director and offered me a very important role. I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer.

500|$|Mengele's {{research}} {{subjects were}} better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily {{safe from the}} gas chambers. He established a kindergarten for children that were the subjects of experiments, along with all Romani {{children under the age}} of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp, and even included a playground. When visiting his child subjects, he <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Uncle Mengele" [...] and offered them sweets. But he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims that he killed via lethal injection, shootings, beatings, and through selections and deadly experiments. Lifton describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely antisemitic, believing the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race. Mengele's son Rolf said his father later showed no remorse for his wartime activities.|$|E

500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Japan, Rossier presumably <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a {{photographer}} despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was {{often referred to as}} an [...] "English" [...] photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genzō, who had been instructed to accompany the [...] "Englishman" [...] and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were {{due to a lack of}} the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.|$|E
500|$|Blek {{was built}} for iOS by {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. While both had coding experience, neither were game developers by trade. This was their first game together as Kunabi Brother. Denis had published short stories and a novel, and Davor released music on a Crónica Electrónica. Davor previously made Flash games and developed the idea for Blek from this experience. He approached Denis about converting the video game Snake for touchscreens, and Denis returned {{with the idea of}} [...] "a line representing an idea that springs to life after it has been drawn". This thought was likely inspired by the calligraphy and ink drawings in a book by Japanese poet Matsuo Basho that Denis was reading. They had several prototypes by mid-2013, when Davor joined an Parisian artist in residence program, where he felt he was treated differently when he <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a game developer instead of as a musician. This experience invigorated his interest in the game medium and led to the brothers' push to finish the game over the next six months.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} a train journey in Japan that Abbe first met Ueshiba. Abbe didn't {{know who he}} was and he reacted to Ueshiba looking at him, saying: [...] "What are you staring at, old man?" [...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I know who you are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong enough to be a martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E

500|$|Hunter {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, {{received}} {{a question about the}} military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy. The questioner, former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American {{men and women in uniform}} are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E
500|$|Jack Warner {{was born}} in London, Ontario, in 1892. His parents were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Poland who spoke mainly Yiddish.

In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.|$|E
