With the {{deepening}} {{of the degree}} of enterprise information,SSL VPN is gradually becoming an important way for remote enterprise users safely connecting with <b>internal</b> <b>servers.</b> SSL VPN takes the role of being an agent of remote clients to access the <b>internal</b> <b>servers.</b> Such function is called HTTP Proxy Server. To avoid being attacked,HTTP Proxy Server encrypts the IP of <b>internal</b> Web <b>Server.</b> This paper presents the design and implementation of the secure HTTP Proxy Server i...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of CA/Browser Forum Ballot 144, a HTTPS certificate for a [...]onion name could only be acquired by treating [...]onion as an <b>Internal</b> <b>Server</b> Name. Per the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, these certificates could be issued, but were required to expire before 1 November 2015. Despite these restrictions, four organizations went ahead with certificate authority partnerships to do so; these were DuckDuckGo in July 2013, Facebook in October 2014, Blockchain.info in December 2014, and The Intercept in April 2015.|$|E

50|$|AMD {{engineering}} {{teams were}} internally tasked with building server reference designs to support Opteron server processor evaluation by customers. During these early <b>internal</b> <b>server</b> design efforts {{it was determined}} that a standard management card subsystem that was reusable across many platforms would decrease time to market while saving design and support costs for AMD reference design platforms in the field. Such an interface would also allow AMD to outsource the design and test of the management card to industry experts. AMD reasoned that external audiences would derive these same benefits as its internal engineering teams and so OPMA was documented and released.|$|E

50|$|For {{security}} and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses {{contained in the}} headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by IP address blocking or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to <b>internal</b> <b>servers.</b> This is achieved with firewall software running on the networks gateway router. A database of IP addresses of permissible traffic may be maintained in blacklists or whitelists.|$|R
50|$|The Berkeley DB used by Project Darkstar stores {{all data}} {{that is to}} be persisted. Anything {{that is to be}} stored in the {{database}} must also be serializable, as the database is programmed to store binary information. A managed object can be anything from player data (i.e. position, equipment) to <b>internal</b> <b>server</b> data and control logic (i.e. scalable data structure, tasks). The usefulness of managed objects is seen in the instance of a server failure. Since managed objects are updated transactionally, any corrupted data is discarded on the server restart and the managed object is rolled back to its last working state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first version}} of WSUS was known as Software Update Services (SUS). At first, it only {{delivered}} hotfixes and patches for Microsoft operating systems. SUS ran on a Windows Server operating system and downloaded updates for the specified versions of Windows from the remote Windows Update site which was operated by Microsoft. Clients could then download updates from this <b>internal</b> <b>server,</b> rather than connecting directly to Windows Update. [...] Support for SUS by Microsoft was originally planned to end on December 6, 2006, but based on user feedback, the date was extended to July 10, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Semantic URLs also do {{not contain}} {{implementation}} details of the underlying web application. This carries the benefit of reducing the difficulty of changing {{the implementation of the}} resource at a later date. For example, many non-semantic URLs include the filename of a server-side script, such as , [...] or [...] If the underlying implementation of a resource is changed, such URLs would need to change along with it. Likewise, when URLs are non-semantic, if the site database is moved or restructured {{it has the potential to}} cause broken links, both internally and from external sites, the latter of which can lead to removal from search engine listings. The use of semantic URLs presents a consistent location for resources to user-agents regardless of internal structure. A further potential benefit to the use of semantic URLs is that the concealment of <b>internal</b> <b>server</b> or application information can improve the security of a system.|$|E

Some internal networks across the organisation have been enabled for IPv6, and dual-stack technology {{is being used to}} enable both IPv4 and IPv6 use.

One of {{the core}} capabilities of ISA Server 2004, dubbed Secure Server Publishing, was its ability to securely expose their <b>internal</b> <b>servers</b> to Internet. For example, some organizations use ISA Server 2004 to publish their Microsoft Exchange Server services such as Outlook Web Access (OWA), Outlook Mobile Access (OMA) or ActiveSync. Using the Forms-based Authentication (FBA) authentication type, ISA Server {{can be used to}} pre-authenticate web clients so that traffic from unauthenticated clients to published servers is not allowed.|$|R

In particular, the application’s server front-end interface (port 80) had to be publicly accessible, the application’s server administrative interface had to be accessible only from selected nodes of the internal network, and the applications’ server should be able to contact the LDAP and MySQL <b>internal</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E

The web based system consists of an <b>internal</b> <b>server</b> linked to an xPC Target real time machine which communicates with a DC Motor control module via relevant DAQ interfaces. In this set up, we attempt to replace the expensive setup of IP camera or video server by a realistic virtual reality model.

In addition, the software also features with multiple login database system allowing students to observe or perform experiments under supervision remotely from the admin server...|$|E
