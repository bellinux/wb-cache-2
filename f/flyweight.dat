5|$|Kentikian {{retained}} her WIBF and WBA belts with {{a unanimous}} decision win over Elena Reid from the United States on March 20, 2009. Reid, who {{was well known}} in Germany after two controversial bouts with Halmich in 2004 and 2005, remained largely passive from the opening bell and Kentikian controlled her through {{the majority of the}} fight. Reid did not win a single round on the official scorecards. On July 4, 2009, Kentikian fought the Interim WBA Super <b>Flyweight</b> Champion Carolina Gutierrez Gaite of Argentina. Kentikian used her speed and combinations to dominate her opponent through the ten rounds, winning every round on the judges' scores. Kentikian ended 2009 by fighting the undefeated Turkish-German Julia Sahin (20–0) on 10 October for the vacant WBO Female <b>Flyweight</b> title. Kentikian overwhelmed Sahin with her higher work rate early on. Sahin spent most of the fight covering up from Kentikian's many flurries. Kentikian gave Sahin a ten-round beating and won a unanimous decision to become the new WBO Female <b>Flyweight</b> Champion.|$|E

30|$|In case of {{creating}} <b>flyweights</b> on product representation level, the local placement of IfcElement serves as local coordinate system. Hence, using a product representation amongst multiple products, the individual linear transformation (or local placement) {{can be applied}} by using the IfcAxis 2 Placement 3 D entity. A corresponding 4 [*]×[*] 4 transformation matrix is converted as follows. Initially, the last row can be discarded, because it is used only for technical reason calculating homogenous transformation products. The translation component (4 th column) is stored as position attribute, the z-Axis (3 rd column) is stored as axis attribute and the x-Axis (1 st column) is stored as ‘RefDirection’. The y-Axis is not stored explicitly since it {{can be derived from}} the cross product of x×z. In case {{of creating}} <b>flyweights</b> on the level of IfcRepresentation, implicit sharing is more restricted. While shape models or style models can be shared separately, a shape model still depends on its initial transformation and the corresponding coordinate system of IfcElement. To apply further local transformation, utilizing IfcMappedItem would be necessary. Lastly, constructing <b>flyweights</b> on the level of representation items enables the finest detail of sharing information. However, applying further transformations can only be applied using a mapped item again.|$|R

Three—Dawood Mahmoude (light <b>flyweight),</b> Rohullah Mustafa (<b>flyweight)</b> and Tamim Ahmed Akhtari (lightweight)—out of six boxers lost after RSCO (Referee Stopped Contest– Outclassed Opponent). Abdullah Shekib retired during his bout against Kazakhstani Gennady Golovkin. Sadeq Naqshbande lost to Sergey Rychko of Kazakhstan after referee stopped the contest (RSC). Sayed Haroon Sadat was the only Afghan boxer who completed his bout, losing to Kumar Adhikari of Nepal by a points difference of 11–13.|$|E

5|$|Five Egyptian boxers {{qualified}} for the Olympics, {{all of whom were}} men and earned their spots at the 2012 African Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. The only Egyptian to win a bout in London was Hesham Yehia, in the <b>flyweight</b> division, who defeated Benson Gicharu of Kenya before losing to Jasurbek Latipov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Yehia's most successful major international tournament had been the 2011 Pan Arab Games, where he had been the <b>flyweight</b> runner-up. The most experienced boxer was Mohamed Hikal, who had competed in the light-middleweight, welterweight, and middleweight categories of the 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympics respectively. Among his international boxing distinctions, he was 1999 and 2003 All-African champion, 2005 Mediterranean champion, 2007 and 2011 Pan Arab champion, and 2007 African champion, and won a bronze medal at the 2005 World Championships. In 2012 he was once again representing Egypt as a middleweight and lost his first bout to Soltan Migitinov of Azerbaijan. Ramy Helmy El-Awadi, a bronze medalist from the 2007 Pan Arab Games, received a bye in the opening round of the light <b>flyweight</b> class and was defeated by Ferhat Pehlivan of Turkey in the round of 16. Mohamed Ramadan and Eslam El-Gendy lost their first bouts to eventual silver medalist Han Soon-Chul of South Korea and Gyula Káté of Hungary in the lightweight and light welterweight events respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Because the magneto has {{low voltage}} output at low speed, {{starting}} an engine is more difficult. Therefore, some magnetos have an impulse coupling, a springlike mechanical linkage between {{the engine and}} magneto drive shaft which [...] "winds up" [...] and [...] "lets go" [...] at the proper moment for spinning the magneto shaft. The impulse coupling uses a spring, a hub cam with <b>flyweights,</b> and a shell. The hub of the magneto rotates while the drive shaft is held stationary, and the spring tension builds up. When the magneto is supposed to fire, the <b>flyweights</b> are released {{by the action of}} the body contacting the trigger ramp. This allows the spring to unwind giving the rotating magnet a rapid rotation and letting the magneto spin at such a speed to produce a spark.|$|R

50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of <b>flyweights</b> {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the <b>flyweights</b> pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R

5|$|Kentikian was {{discovered}} {{as a professional}} boxer at an exhibition fight during qualifications for the World Amateur Boxing Championships. At the beginning of 2005, she signed a three-year contract with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing, a joint venture of Universum Box-Promotion, focusing on young athletes. Since then, she has been coached by Universum trainer Magomed Schaburow. Kentikian started her professional career on January 15, 2005, with a win by unanimous decision over Iliana Boneva of Bulgaria on the undercard of German female boxing star Regina Halmich. Over the next 14months, Kentikian won nine of her eleven fights by knockout. Her unusually high knockout percentage, rarely seen in lower female weight classes, began to draw attention. On July 25, 2006, she won her first belt, the International German <b>flyweight</b> title, against Daniela Graf by unanimous decision. In her first international title fight on September 9, 2006, Kentikian beat Maribel Zurita from the United States with a fourth round technical knockout for the WIBF InterContinental <b>Flyweight</b> title; the fight was stopped when Zurita was cut over the left eyebrow.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian, now the WIBF, WBA and WBO Female <b>Flyweight</b> Champion, {{made the}} first defense of all her titles against Nadia Raoui on 24 April 2010. The bout was very close, with Kentikian landing more cleaner and harder shots, yet Raoui finding much success as well. After ten close rounds, Kentikian won via split decision.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of long-standing WIBF belt holder Regina Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF <b>Flyweight</b> titles {{in her hometown of}} Hamburg on December 7, 2007. She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored {{during the second half of}} the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian was ahead on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.|$|E
50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, <b>flyweights,</b> and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or underspeed condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The <b>flyweights</b> begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the {{pitch of the propeller}} angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the <b>flyweights</b> to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|R
5000|$|Armais {{was born}} to the Armenian wrestler Vagan Sayadyan, who changed his last name to Sayadov to blend in Azerbaijan. Besides Georgy, Armais had three other brothers. Initially both Georgy and Armais competed as <b>flyweights</b> in {{freestyle}} wrestler, but Armais later moved to Greco-Roman wrestling to avoid competing against his brother. After retiring from competitions {{he had a long}} career as a coach and referee. In 1990, during the Baku pogrom, he fled to Kiev, Ukraine.|$|R
5000|$|A {{screw press}} {{is a type}} of machine press in which the ram is driven up and down by a screw. The screw shaft can be driven by a handle or a wheel. It works by using a coarse screw to convert the {{rotation}} of the handle or drive-wheel into a small downward movement of greater force. The overhead handle usually incorporates balls as <b>flyweights.</b> The weights helps to maintain the momentum and thrust of the tool {{to make it easier to}} operate.|$|R
