40|$|Abstract—Relationships between forest {{vegetation}} and soil were reconstructed from field {{notes of the}} 1846 Public Land Survey (PLS) along {{a portion of the}} Cache River including Black Swamp. Locations of corners were digitized along with species, diameter, and distance from section or quarter-section corners. Trees were grouped for analysis according to occurrence on groups of ecologically meaningful soil units (similar texture, flood frequency and saturation) using a digitized county soil map. Trees occurring at corners were treated as point-quarter samples to calculate density and dominance; these and relative abundance were used to calculate importance value (IV). Five bottomland and two upland types were defined, based on ecological distinctions in site characteristics. Based on ordination by Detrended Correspondence Analysis, these were shown to occupy a moisture gradient from frequently flooded bottomlands, through less flooded and better-drained bottomlands to well-drained uplands and dry uplands. These types are analyzed to allow restoration biologists maximum flexibility in using them in setting or analyzing restoration goals. One bottomland type occurred on sites where hydrologic regime has been altered by <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>levees</b> to the extent that restoration to the presettlement forest is no longer possible.

40|$|America's largest wetland {{community}} {{is losing its}} marshes and swamps to the Gulf of Mexico. The wetlands of coastal Louisiana are being converted to open water {{at a rate of}} fifty square miles per year, {{largely as a result of}} maintaining shipping lanes, the dredging of canals, <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>levees,</b> and the withdrawal of oil and gas. If current trends continue, an ecosystem that supports the nation's oldest bilingual culture, 25 percent of the nation's fishing industry, and North America's largest fur-producing area, will be mostly lost in the next century. This process could be further accelerated if sea level rises one or more feet as a result of the projected global warming from the greenhouse effect. Over the last twenty years, various solutions have been suggested to save Louisiana's coastal wetlands. Proposals have included unharnessing the Mississippi River; breaching the levees to allow river water to reach the wetlands; building giant levees along the entire coast; restoring the rapidly disintegrating barrier islands; filling the many canals that have been dredged through the marsh; or combinations of these alternatives.

40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Levees in California???s Central Valley {{currently}} face {{an unacceptable}} {{high level of}} risk. Many agencies are now attempting to analyze the probability of levee failure and the resulting flooding and damages. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is currently evaluating the flood risk associated with the approximately 1, 600 miles of State Plan of <b>Flood</b> <b>Control</b> <b>levees</b> throughout California???s Central Valley. The objective {{of this study is}} to present a methodology for determining floodplains associated with various potential levee breaches. Middle Creek and its tributaries contain 13. 5 miles of levees that protect the town of Upper Lake in Northern California. According to DWR???s <b>Flood</b> <b>Control</b> System Status Report, many of these levees have a high potential for failure. This study will utilize the most current topographical and survey data that is available from DWR to develop the hydraulic models. vi The modeling software used for this study includes the United States Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center- River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and FLO- 2 D, developed by FLO- 2 D Software, Inc. These softwares are used to model the one-dimensional channel flows and two-dimensional overland flood flows caused by levee breaches. The popularity of two-dimensional hydraulic models has grown substantially in recent years. These two-dimensional models have benefitted from increased computing power which has resulted in faster simulation times and lower project costs. The hydraulic models for this study were developed to be consistent with the recommendations made by the DWR Hydrology and Hydraulics Coordination Work Group, which is a team of leading hydraulic modelers in California. The results of the model simulations are presented as water surface profiles and floodplain depth and velocity maps for the 100 - and 500 -year flood events. Civil Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Since {{the early}} 1950 's, the {{distribution}} of sediment {{at the mouth of}} Redwood Creek has been altered by the effects of channel aggradation and channelization along the lower reach. Severe flooding in 1953, 1955, and 1964 caused bank erosion, landsliding, and channel geometry changes along Redwood Creek. The increased sediment load resulted in channel aggradation and widening along the lower floodplain. <b>Flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>levees</b> constructed from 1966 to 1968 channelized the lower reach of Redwood Creek and extended beyond the last downstream meander. The distribution of erosional and depositional sites at the mouth has been more drastically altered by the effects of channelization than of aggradation. Channelization was accompanied by removal of bed roughness elements, shaping a trapezoidal channel with an increased hydraulic radius, and steepening the channel gradient. This caused an increase in the mean velocity and frequency of mobilization of the substrate between the levees. With streamflow confined between the levees, sediments deposited in the last downstream meander (south slough) and north slough are no longer flushed from the mouth of Redwood Creek. Since 1966, 47 - 54 percent of the lower estuary (between 0 and 4 feet above MSL) has filled with sediment or become isolated from the embayment. Sediment yield of Redwood Creek is among the highest for a basin of its size in North America, but under present conditions fluvial sediment is not accumulating at the mouth. Heavy mineral and textural data indicate that during high to moderate streamflow, sand and gravel-sized sediment is flushed through the embayment. Overwash across the storm berm and tidal current transport are the dominant processes of deposition in the sloughs, delivering marine sediment to the estuary. Sediment accumulation has also altered the seasonal sequence of migration and closure of the outflow channel which determines the embayment water volume, substrate distribution and water quality during the low flow period from spring to early fall. More frequent closure and flooding of backwater areas and adjacent pastures has historically led to artificial breaching of the berm. In the past, such premature breaching released 75 percent of the embayed water volume being used by 20, 000 juvenile salmonids for summer rearing habitat...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century farmers along the White River were {{subjected}} to nearly annual floods. Sometimes farmers would use dynamite to divert the river into different channels. In 1899 one such explosion went awry and ended up diverting most of the White River into the Stuck River, thence the Puyallup. Dynamiting the river channels continued until the major flood of 1906 which ended up sending the entire White River down the Stuck River. Because {{of the risk of}} floods, the diversion was not wanted by Pierce County, which sued King County in an attempt to have the White River rediverted away from the Stuck River. The lawsuit dragged on for years until 1913 when the two counties reached an agreement. Pierce County would keep the White River, but King County would pay 60% of the cost of <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> Dams, <b>levees,</b> and barriers were built along the White River in hopes of preventing major flooding, but in 1933 a large flood inundated the region. The two counties realized they were unable to tame the river and so turned to the federal government. The result was Mud Mountain Dam.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{population}} {{and economic growth}} in Texas is accompanied by increased needs for water supply and <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> Depleting groundwater reserves are resulting in an increased reliance on surface water. The rising cost of fossil fuel during the 1970 's has focused attention on increasing hydroelectric power generation. Instream flow needs for fish and wildlife habitat and maintenance of fresh water inflows to bays and estuaries have received increased attention in recent years. The climate {{of the state is}} characterized by extremes of floods and droughts. Reservoirs are necessary to control and utilize the highly variable streamflow. Due to a number of economic, environmental, institutional, and political factors, construction of additional new reservoir projects is much more difficult now than in the past. Consequently, optimizing the beneficial use of existing reservoirs is becoming increasingly more important. In addition to ever increasing water related needs, other factors affecting reservoir operation change over time as well. Watershed and flood plain conditions are dynamic. Construction of numerous small flood retarding dams by the Soil Conservation Service and other entities in the watersheds of major reservoirs have reduced flood inflows to the reservoirs. Construction of numerous small ponds for recreation or watering livestock have also decreased reservoir inflows and yields. Increased runoff caused by watershed urbanization is significantly contributing to flooding problems in certain locations. The existing <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> reservoirs were planned and designed based on the expectation of ever increasing intensification of flood plain land use. However, the National Flood Insurance Program has resulted in zoning and regulation of 100 -year flood plains. With stringent flood plain management, susceptibility to flooding could actually decrease over time as existing activities choose to leave the flood plain and regulation prevents other activities from moving into the flood plain. Reservoir sedimentation reduces available storage capacity. Construction of additional reservoirs, as well as other related types of projects such as conveyance facilities, <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>levees</b> and channel improvements, and electric power plants, affect the operation of existing reservoirs. Technological advancements in hydrologic data collection, streamflow forecasting, system modeling and analysis, and computer technology provide opportunities for refining operating policies. Reservoir storage capacities and operating policies are generally established prior to construction and tend to remain constant thereafter. However, public needs and objectives and numerous factors affecting reservoir effectiveness significantly change over time. The increasing necessity to use limited storage capacity as effectively as possible warrants periodic reevaluations of operating policies. Operating procedures should be responsive to changing needs and conditions. Reallocation of storage capacity between <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and conservation purposes represents one general strategy for modifying operating policies in response to changing needs and conditions. Reservoir operation is based upon the conflicting objectives of maximizing the amount of water available for conservation purposes and maximizing the amount of empty space available for storing flood waters. Conservation purposes include municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and instream flow maintenance. Common practice is to operate a reservoir only for conservation purposes or only for <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> or to designate a certain reservoir volume, or pool, for conservation purposes and a separate pool for <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> The conservation and <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> pools in a multiple purpose reservoir are fixed by a designated top of conservation (bottom of <b>flood</b> <b>control)</b> pool elevation. Planning, design, and operating problems associated with <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> are handled separately from those associated with conservation. Institutional arrangements are also based on separating <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and conservation purposes. Increasing needs for providing water for various uses and reducing flood damages necessitate that limited reservoir storage capacity be used as beneficially as possible. Consequently, consideration of the interactions and tradeoffs between conservation and <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> operations is becoming increasingly more important. The traditional analysis methods and practices followed in planning and design of reservoir projects and during real-time operations have not really addressed the tradeoffs and interactions between <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and conservation purposes. In general, expanded analysis capabilities are needed for periodically reevaluating the operating policies of existing reservoir systems. A particular need in this regard is for improved methods for evaluating the tradeoffs involved in reallocating storage capacity between <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and conservation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Floods {{are one of}} {{the major}} natural {{disasters}} that often threaten human lives and cause significant economic losses around the world. The history of mankind is filled with the stories of our struggles with floods to protect human races and to sustain the progression of our civilizations. Flood defense systems are designed and constructed to protect low-lying areas against flooding. Engineering design often is at the final stage for finding technical means to best accomplish the project goals. Conceptually, in the cost of the protection system, {{the most important factor in}} designing flood defense systems, should be in balance with the value of the protected area. Over the years, risk-based design and optimization methods have proven to be useful tools to obtain a balanced level of protection. The most common economic framework for floodplain management is minimization of expected annual damages and flood management expenses, structural and nonstructural <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> options. <b>Levee</b> systems have been built for flood protection in numerous rivers, lakes and coasts in the world over the long human history.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the response of macrophytes to physico-chemical factors in seven South African estuaries and showed that dominant salt marsh species that occur in different estuaries respond to the same environmental factors. The most important variables influencing distribution were elevation, water level, sediment- and groundwater electrical conductivity and depth to the water table. In permanently open estuaries (Kromme and Olifants) transect surveys identified three distinct vegetation zones i. e. submerged macrophytes, intertidal salt marsh and supratidal salt marsh. In the Kromme Estuary intertidal salt marsh (81. 2 ha) covered extensive areas, whereas supratidal (143 ha) and floodplain (797. 1 ha) salt marsh were dominant in the Olifants Estuary. Transect surveys identified four distinct vegetation zones (submerged macrophytes, intertidal salt marsh, supratidal salt marsh and reeds and sedges) in the temporarily open/closed estuaries (Mngazi, Great Brak, East Kleinemonde and Seekoei estuaries), although all zones did not occur {{in all of the}} estuaries sampled. In the Mngazi Estuary reeds and sedges (1. 09 ha) covered extensive areas (no submerged or salt marsh vegetation was present), whereas salt marsh (Great Brak 24. 45 ha, East Kleinemonde 17. 44 ha and Seekoei 12. 9 ha) vegetation was dominant in the other estuaries. Despite the geographic differences, environmental factors influencing macrophyte distribution were similar in all estuaries. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that vegetation distribution was significantly affected by elevation, groundwater and sediment electrical conductivity and depth to groundwater. Supratidal species were associated with a greater depth to groundwater (1. 2 ± 0. 04 m; n = 153) compared to intertidal species (0. 5 ± 0. 01 m; n = 361). Correlation analysis showed that water level and rainfall were correlated with groundwater electrical conductivity in the lower and upper intertidal zones for all the estuaries sampled. These data indicate the influence of the estuary channel on the physico-chemical conditions of the salt marsh. Low rainfall (16 ± 3. 3 mm per annum) in the Olifants Estuary (30 - 100 mS cm- 1) and lack of freshwater flooding in the Kromme Estuary (42 - 115 mS cm- 1) have resulted in high sediment electrical conductivity by comparison with the other estuaries sampled. In the Orange River Estuary approximately 70 ha of salt marsh have been lost through the building of a causeway and <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>levees.</b> Even though salt marsh vegetation can tolerate hypersaline sediments by using the less saline water table, the groundwater at the Orange River Estuary was too saline (avg. of 90. 3 ± 6. 55 mS cm- 1, n = 38) to be of use to the dominant floodplain species, Sarcocornia pillansii. Freshwater inflow to estuaries is important in maintaining longitudinal salinity gradients and reducing hypersaline conditions. In the Olifants Estuary and the Orange River Estuary where supratidal salt marsh is dominant, freshwater inflow is important in raising the water level and maintaining the depth to groundwater and salinity. Lack of freshwater inflow to the Kromme Estuary has highlighted the importance of rainfall in maintaining sediment salinity within acceptable ranges for the salt marsh. Macrophytes are relatively good indicators of physico-chemical factors in estuaries. From an understanding of the response of specific species to environmental variables, ecological water requirements can be set and sensitive areas can be rehabilitate...|$|R
