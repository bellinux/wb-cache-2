40|$|Many perovskite-structured ceramic {{materials}} {{are known to}} have useful microwave dielectric properties, with promising applications in mobile telecommunications, an industry which will be worth an estimated $ 341 billion by 2015. Current mathematical models used to predict the functional properties of specific perovskites are poorly suited to complex or defective structures. In the present study, a solid-state processing method was used to synthesize perovskite ceramics in the system [(Ca,Sr) 1 - 3 n/ 2 Lnn]TiO 3 (Ln = La or Nd). Single-phase powder samples were produced at 1300 ºC and characterized using X-ray diffraction. The resulting products were then uniaxially pressed to form pellets which were sintered at temperatures up to 1600 ºC. This work investigates the effect of point defects on the structure of the resultant perovskites. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model, based solely on composition and <b>easily-obtainable</b> published reference data, for the effect of point defects on the structure and, by extension, dielectric properties of perovskites...|$|E
40|$|Endometrial {{dysfunction}} affects approximately 1 % of infertile women, {{and there}} is currently no standard therapy for improving fertility treatment outcomes in these patients. In our study, we utilized a rodent model of thin endometrium to test whether intrauterine application of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction cells (SVF) could improve morphological and physiological markers of endometrial receptivity. Using anhydrous ethanol, endometrial area and gland density were significantly reduced in our model of thin endometrium. Application of SVF {{was associated with a}} 29 % reduction in endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and significant increases in uterine artery systolic/diastolic velocity ratios and resistance index values, suggesting reduced diastolic microvascular tone. However, no significant improvements in endometrial area or gland density were observed following SVF treatment. 3 D confocal imaging demonstrated poor engraftment of SVF cells into recipient tissue, which likely contributed to the negative results of this study. We suspect modified treatment protocols utilizing adjuvant estrogen and/or tail vein cell delivery may improve SVF retention and therapeutic response in subsequent studies. SVF is an <b>easily-obtainable</b> cell product with regenerative capability that may have a future role in the treatment of infertile women with endometrial dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesSepsis-associated {{encephalopathy}} (SAE) is {{the most}} widespread metabolic encephalopathy, which continues to be clinically evaluated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of serum tau protein as an effective and easily attainable biochemical marker {{of morbidity and mortality}} for patients with SAE. MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 70 patients admitted to the emergency department with sepsis or septic shock, who were then diagnosed with SAE based on the GCS between February 2, 2009 and July 30, 2009. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between serum tau levels, the development of SAE and subsequent patient morbidity and mortality. ResultsOut {{of the total number of}} patients enrolled in the study, 50 % received the diagnosis of SAE based on GCS upon admission. Of the patients admitted to the hospital for further observation, 2. 9 % developed SAE over the course of several days using GCS criteria. Even though tau levels were higher in patients with SAE, there was no statistically significant difference with tau levels in patients that did not develop SAE. In addition, there were no significant correlations between tau levels, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and patient mortality. ConclusionsSerum tau levels do not reflect brain damage and encephalopathy for SAE patients. Moreover, this protein does not correlate with patient morbidity and mortality and the SOFA score. Thus, serum tau protein cannot be utilized as a reliable biochemical marker of SAE. Further research is needed to identify effective and <b>easily-obtainable</b> biomarkers to supplement the GCS in SAE diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Microbiological {{water quality}} {{monitoring}} of bathing waters {{does not account}} for faecal bacteria in sediments. Intertidal deposits are a significant reservoir of faecal bacteria and this indicates there is a risk to human health through direct contact with the sediment, or through the resuspension of bacteria to the water column. This project investigated factors influencing the relative abundance of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in intertidal estuarine sediments. The effects of physical, biogeochemical and biological sediment characteristics, environmental variables and native microbial communities were explored through field campaigns on the Ythan and Eden estuaries, Scotland. The contributory role of sediments to adverse water quality was investigated by combining FIO abundance and measurements of sediment stability. The importance of strain and sediment characteristics in the adhesion of E. coli to suspended sediments was also examined using laboratory experiments. E. coli concentrations up to 5. 9 log₁₀ CFU 100 g dry wt⁻¹ were observed, confirming that intertidal sediments are an important reservoir of faecal bacteria. The variability of E. coli abundance in estuarine sediments was successfully explained with multiple stepwise linear regression (Adjusted R² up to 87. 4) using <b>easily-obtainable</b> measurements of sediment characteristics and environmental variables, with variability most heavily influenced by salinity and particle size gradients. Native microbial community population metrics and community constituent composition correlated with environmental gradients, but did not influence FIO abundance. The amount of E. coli adhering to suspended sediments ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 74 log₁₀ CFU ml⁻¹, and was dependant on strain characteristics and sediment type rather than zeta potential, with higher cell-particle adhesion at 2 and 3. 5 PSU than 0 and 5 PSU. Monitoring of sediment characteristics will lead to more informed bathing water quality advisories to protect public health. Future research should focus on applying the findings here to the modelling of bacterial fate and transport on a catchment scale...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} quantified {{the effectiveness}} of agricultural riparian buffers to protect stream health in Maryland's Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions. <b>Easily-obtainable</b> data were used to develop scientific guidance for buffer management strategies. Three data sets were used: the 1998 University of Maryland Agricultural Buffer Survey, the 1996 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center Water Quality Survey, and the 1995 - 1997 Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Collectively, these data were used to represent baseflow water quality and landscape conditions in agricultural catchments. A set of landscape characteristics describing the agricultural riparian landscape was developed, from which a classification system for agricultural riparian landscapes was developed. The Agricultural Riparian Classification System can identify a subset of sites for targeted research. Additionally, the distribution of agricultural riparian buffers was characterized. Although over 70 % of sites were buffered, because the statewide average buffer width was approximately 49 meters, almost 50 % of buffers could not be detected by remotely sensed data with a resolution of 30 meters. Models were developed to predict measures of stream health at a site. Buffers acted differently on instream nitrate concentration, fish IBI (FIBI), benthic IBI (BIBI), and instream physical habitat (PHI). All models indicated that nitrate source terms overshadowed any on-site buffer effects and that Confined Animal Feeding Operations and pastures acted as point sources, overwhelming non-point-source effects. Therefore, livestock best managements practices are critical for the reduction of nitrate to streams. Fish IBI, benthic IBI and physical habitat index (PHI) in the Piedmont region were unaffected by buffer presence, but benthic IBI and PHI in the Coastal Plain were affected by buffer presence, type and width. Regression tree modeling was able to delineate a range of minimum effective buffer width between 22 - 38 meters. All measures of stream health in Piedmont systems were controlled by hydrology and geomorphology. Therefore, insofar as buffers can mediate hydrologic effects on flow conditions in a stream, they may indirectly affect FIBI, and BIBI and PHI in Piedmont systems. Use of fish IBI to measure success of buffer installation or restoration would give false results...|$|E
40|$|Drought is a {{recurrent}} hazard, which has happened throughout human history, {{and it is}} anticipated to become more severe in multiple regions across the world. Drought occurs in all climate regimes from humid to dry and from hot to cold. Drought is often viewed through its impact on environment and society, including wildfire, which is the topic of this study. The nature of such impacts differs remarkably from region to region. Although drought does not directly cause wildfire, it provides favorable conditions for wildfire ignition and spread. When drought coincides with strong El Niño events in the humid tropics, e. g. Southeast Asia, the impacts worsen through uncontrolled forest fires affecting the global carbon cycle. These include reduction of the carbon stock, intensifying the haze hazard, and other severe socio-economic impacts in Southeast Asia, including areas {{far away from the}} burnt area, e. g. Singapore because of fires in Sumatra. There still remains a serious lack of scientific understanding about the fundamental role of drought in fire-generating processes. Most research, so far, suggests that climate controls wildfire occurrence in the humid tropics. However, this climate-centered approach, which is reflected in contemporary drought-fire related indices, overlooks soil and hydrological processes beneath the surface across the humid tropics. There is also uncertainty about the relative roles of climate variability and human activities in influencing the nature and distribution of drought-related wildfires. Hence, the general objective of this PhD research is to examine how characterization of hydrological drought under natural and human-modified conditions can improve understanding of wildfires in general in the humid tropics. Chapter 2 discusses the contribution of humans to an increase of hydrological drought severity in the tropical peatland of Southeast Asia. Climate variability induces drought in the region, however, human activities (human-modified drought) may increase its severity. Analyzing long time series of simulated historical groundwater levels from selected regions in Southeast Asia, which were validated against some years with observations, revealed that human interference (through canalization and land-use change) has amplified drought severity. The drought amplification due to human interference was at least double that of climate-induced drought. The amplification is even higher when peatland is converted into acacia plantation. Further, research findings suggest that even if the Paris Agreement target is met, drought risk of peatlands remains high unless sustainable water management receives top priority in the region. Chapter 3 deals with how an existing, well-known drought-fire related index, i. e. the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), is modified to improve applicability in the humid climate environment of Southeast Asia. The improvement includes: (i) adjustment of the drought factor to the local climate, and (ii) addition of the water table depth as a dynamic factor to fine-tune the drought index. The results indicate that the modified Keetch-Byram Drought Index (mKBDI) performed well in predicting fire hazard. Furthermore, the research identified a critical water table depth, which represents maximum fire hazard (0. 85 m for the wetland forest of South Sumatra). Below this value hazard does not increase anymore. The mKBDI could be more widely applied, if pedotransfer functions would be developed that link <b>easily-obtainable</b> soil properties to the parameters of the water table factor. Chapter 4 shows that wetland transformation (i. e. through canalization and land-use change) not only affects hydrological drought (Chapter  2), but also influences fire behaviour. In Southeast Asia, expansion of agricultural cropland and forest plantations has changed the landscape of wetlands. The findings showed that the transformation into acacia plantation has amplified the fire hazard from 4 % (under natural conditions) to 17 %. An even higher amplification (40 % fire hazard) is expected under poor water management, that is, uncontrolled drainage. The findings derived from this observation-based modeling experiment suggest that improved water management (controlled drainage with higher dry season surface water levels) can minimize fire susceptibility. Chapter 5 explains the importance of hydrology for fire hazard studies. Borneo is selected to investigate the added value of including hydrological variables in fire hazard prediction approaches. More than 300 statistical models were tested, and the results showed that models that include hydrological variables better predict area burnt than those solely based on climate indicators/indices. Further, modelling evidence shows amplifying wildfires and greater area burnt in response to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strength, when hydrology is considered. These results highlight the importance of considering hydrological drought for wildfire prediction. I recommend that hydrology should be considered in future studies of the impact of projected ENSO strength, including effects on tropical ecosystems and biodiversity conservation. The contributions of this thesis research to science are summarized and synthesized in Chapter 6. First, the research identified that fire hazard studies would benefit from adding hydrology, which is reflected in the improved model performance when hydrological variables are integrated. Next, the research revealed that humans play a substantial role in modifying groundwater drought characteristics, hence amplifying the fire hazard in Southeast Asia. Further, the chapter identified several relevant research findings, including the model choice, which should consider the simplicity and the applicability of the model. Another finding demonstrated that controlling canal water level through canal blocking is a practical water management tool to restore degraded wetland. This restored wetland would benefit some endemic species. However, the restored wetland still faces high drought severity. Hence they remain more fire-prone until the un-impacted hydrology condition is achieved. Finally, this research suggest that currently widely-used drought indices (such as FWI) require improvements in their model structure, which means integration of hydrological variables to increase their applicability for fire hazard studies in the humid tropics...|$|E
