40|$|Abstract The {{adaptation}} of the grip forces to the fric-tional condition between the digits and an object relies on feedforward sensorimotor mechanisms that use tactile afferent input to intermittently update a sensorimotor memory that controls the force coordination, i. e., the ra-tio between grip force (normal to the <b>grip</b> <b>surface)</b> and load force (tangential to the <b>grip</b> <b>surface).</b> The present study addressed {{the development of these}} mechanisms. Eighty-nine children and 15 adults lifted an instrumented object with exchangeable grip surfaces measuring the grip and load forces. Particularly in trials with high fric-tion (sandpaper), the youngest children used a high grip force to load force ratio.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of a climbing hold was attempted to be quantified based on fractal dimensions. The difficulty {{was confined to}} the change of a single value, namely the inclination of the <b>grip</b> <b>surface,</b> by increasing the overhang of the wall. Sixteen climbers of different experience levels participated in this experiment and had to climb a route equipped with an instrumented hold repeatedly until they failed at a specific degree of overhang. The forcetime signals served to calculate the Hausdorff dimension. Subsequently, the Hausdorff dimension was normalised to force and time by a power fit. The normalised Hausdorff dimension increases significantly with the {{difficulty of}} a climbing hold, which is - in this study - the inclination of the <b>grip</b> <b>surface.</b> Weaker climbers produced larger normalised Hausdorff dimensions. If the climber fails at the instrumented hold, the force-time signal shows smaller normalised Hausdorff dimensions. Fractal dimensions are a suitable tool to quantify the difficulty of a hold if applied with caution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Failure {{in proper}} design of {{ergonomic}} hand tools {{can lead to}} the prevalence of hand-related injuries. In order to improve the ergonomics of hand tools, numerous studies have been done on causal factors related to these injuries such as grip postures, grip forces and torque directions. Nevertheless, there appears to be limited studies concerning how pinch effort can change with different types of tactile sensations. Therefore this study aims {{to determine the effects of}} different tactile sensations on pinch effort. A total of 110 manual workers from the wooden pallets and furniture manufacturing firm participated in the study. The descriptive analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel 2010 and the reliability of data was verified using Cronbach's alpha reliability analyses. The results show that individuals can produce a greater pinch effort while gripping objects that have a high friction coefficient between the fingers and the <b>grip</b> <b>surface.</b> This study improves our understanding on the implications of different tactile sensations and potentially decreases workplace hazards for eventual improvements on safety, health and medical costs...|$|E
40|$|Reach-to-grasp {{movements}} change quantitatively in a lawful (i. e. predictable) manner {{with changes}} in object properties. We explored whether altering object texture would produce qualitative changes {{in the form of}} the precontact movement patterns. Twelve participants reached to lift objects from a tabletop. Nine objects were produced, each with one of three <b>grip</b> <b>surface</b> textures (high-friction, medium-friction and low-friction) and one of three widths (50 mm, 70 mm and 90 mm). Each object was placed at three distances (100 mm, 300 mm and 500 mm), representing a total of 27 trial conditions. We observed two distinct movement patterns across all trials [...] participants either: (i) brought their arm to a stop, secured the object and lifted it from the tabletop; or (ii) grasped the object 'on-the-fly', so it was secured in the hand while the arm was moving. A majority of grasps were on-the-fly when the texture was high-friction and none when the object was low-friction, with medium-friction producing an intermediate proportion. Previous research has shown that the probability of on-the-fly behaviour is a function of grasp surface accuracy constraints. A finger friction rig was used to calculate the coefficients of friction for the objects and these calculations showed that the area available for a stable grasp (the 'functional grasp surface size') increased with surface friction coefficient. Thus, knowledge of functional grasp surface size is required to predict the probability of observing a given qualitative form of grasping in human prehensile behaviour...|$|E
40|$|What determines {{coordination}} patterns {{when both}} hands reach to grasp separate objects {{at the same}} time? It is known that synchronous timing is preferred as the most stable mode of bimanual coordination. Nonetheless, normal unimanual prehension behaviour predicts asynchrony when the two hands reach towards unequal targets, with synchrony restricted to targets equal in size and distance. Additionally,suffciently separated targets require sequential looking. Does synchrony occur in all cases because it is preferred in bimanual coordination or does asynchrony occur because of unimanual task constraints {{and the need for}} sequential looking? We investigated coordinative timing when participants (n = 8) moved their right (preferred) hand to the same object at a fixed distance but the left hand to objects of diVerent width (3, 5, and 7 cm) and <b>grip</b> <b>surface</b> size (1, 2, and 3 cm) placed at diVerent distances (20, 30, and 40 cm) over 270 randomised trials. The hand movements consisted of two components: (1) an initial component (IC) during which the hand reached towards the target while forming an appropriate grip aperture, stopping at (but not touching the object; (2) a completion component (CC) during which the Wnger and thumb closed on the target. The two limbs started the IC together but did not interact until the deceleration phase when evidence of synchronisation began to appear. Nonetheless, asynchronous timing was present {{at the end of the}} IC and preserved through the CC even with equidistant targets. Thus, there was synchrony but requirements for visual information ultimately yielded asynchronous coordinative timing...|$|E

30|$|Hard, bumpy and {{inconsistent}} were surface properties perceived to {{have contributed to}} an injury on both NT and AT, rendering surface properties equally as important to consider as surface type when reporting injuries. Players strongly linked ligament damage to AT (Fig.  4 and Table  3) which contrasts some studies reporting no increase in the likelihood of sustaining a serious injury between surface types [7]. Exploring players’ perceptions of ligament damage on AT and muscle strain on NT, the regression model interestingly showed both ‘Hard’ and ‘Soft’ surface properties to be predictors for these perceived injuries suggesting neither surface property was suitable. A similar outcome was found for high and low <b>grip.</b> <b>Surface</b> properties are identified as potential risk factors for injury in several sports [2, 21]; however, surface conditions are often based on subjective assessment [12]. Given the link between injuries and surface properties, regardless of surface type, {{there might be a}} need for NT surfaces to be tested and meet the requirements of an industry standard similar to the FIFA Quality Programme for Football Turf, which to the authors’ knowledge does not currently exist. The methods used to assess the hardness or grip of a playing surface will be important to consider in the future given that subjective ratings of subtle surface hardness differences show low agreement to objective measures of ground hardness [11, 12]. Hence, to reduce injury risk, the surface properties should be considered from objective (i.e. engineering) and subjective (i.e. player) perspectives [22]. Objective and subjective surface property differences could then form the focus of injury comparison studies rather than between discrete surface types.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the control of grip force when manipulating an object with an extremely small mass using a precision grip, although some related information has been provided by studies conducted in an unusual microgravity environment. Grip-load force coordination was examined while healthy adults (N = 17) held a moveable instrumented apparatus with its mass changed between 6 g and 200 g in 14 steps, with its <b>grip</b> <b>surface</b> set as either sandpaper or rayon. Additional measurements of grip-force-dependent finger-surface contact area and finger skin indentation, {{as well as a}} test of weight discrimination, were also performed. For each surface condition, the static grip force was modulated in parallel with load force while holding the object of a mass above 30 g. For objects with mass smaller than 30 g, on the other hand, the parallel relationship was changed, resulting in a progressive increase in grip-to-load force (GF/LF) ratio. The rayon had a higher GF/LF force ratio across all mass levels. The proportion of safety margin in the static grip force and normalized moment-to-moment variability of the static grip force were also elevated towards {{the lower end of the}} object mass for both surfaces. These findings indicate that the strategy of grip force control for holding objects with an extremely small mass differs from that with a mass above 30 g. The data for the contact area, skin indentation, and weight discrimination suggest that a decreased level of cutaneous feedback signals from the finger pads could have played some role in a cost function in efficient grip force control with low-mass objects. The elevated grip force variability associated with signal-dependent and internal noises, and anticipated inertial force on the held object due to acceleration of the arm and hand, could also have contributed to the cost function...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focus on}} the unique human ability {{to pick up and}} {{manipulate}} small objects using the precision grip, i. e., the fine grip between the index finger and the thumb. This ability is formed by the interplay between the complex biomechanical machinery of the hand and the neural networks within the central nervous system. To gain further knowledge about how humans control the precision grip, both the biomechanical system and the neural control system has to be examined. For the control system, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging on human subjects to mapout the cortical network involved in different aspects of the precision grip. When subjects applied a small grip force in comparison to a larger gripforce, activity in secondary sensorimotor related areas in the frontal and parietal lobes increased. Our result suggests that these areas {{play an important role in}} the control of fine precision grip forces in the range typically used in manipulation of small objects. We also observed increased activity in a small area of the right intraparietal cortex when the subjects coordinated the grip and the load forces in an attempt to lift a fixated object. This is the first evidence for involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in the sensorimotor control of coordinated grip and lift forces in manipulation. We applied a system identification approach to model the biomechanical system. A new technique was presented, common subsystem identification, with which the common mathematical factors in two models, identified using data from functionally different experiments, was estimated. It is concluded that these factors represent the common subsystem, here the grip force generator, involved in the experiments. The characteristics of the identified model were in agreement with experimental data on human neuromuscular grip force dynamics. The model was then extended to include wrist movement, and the consequent lift force from the frictional interaction with an object. Predictions of the motor commands (control signals) could then be formed by feeding human data through the inverted model. Hence, the motor commands used in response to an unexpectedly low friction at the <b>grip</b> <b>surface,</b> could be estimated. In agreement with recordings from neurons in the primary motor cortex of the monkey, a sharp burst in the estimated motor command for the gripforce efficiently arrested any slip. The results further indicate a state dependent control system that uses a small set of efficient corrective commands. The predicted motor commands was also compared with those theoretically optimized, with respect to minimum variance in fingertip forces. This was based on the suggestion that signal-dependent noise in the motor command influences movement control (Harris and Wolpert, 1998). We show, for the first time, that minimization of the gripforce variance, due to signal-dependent noise, indeed explains the characteristic motor commands and force profiles of a voluntary precision grip, as well as the m...|$|E
