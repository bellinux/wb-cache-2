40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prevent {{fluorosis}} {{caused by}} excessive fluoride ingestion by revising recommendations for fluoride intake by children. OPTIONS: Limiting fluoride ingestion from fluoridated water, fluoride supplements and fluoride dentifrices. OUTCOMES: Reduction in {{the prevalence of}} dental fluorosis and continued prevention of dental caries. EVIDENCE: Before the workshop, experts prepared comprehensive literature reviews of <b>fluoride</b> <b>therapies,</b> <b>fluoride</b> ingestion and the prevalence and causes of dental fluorosis. The papers, which were peer-reviewed, revised and circulated to the workshop participants, {{formed the basis of}} the workshop discussions. VALUES: Recommendations to limit fluoride intake were vigorously debated before being adopted as the consensus opinion of the workshop group. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Decrease in the prevalence of dental fluorosis with continuing preventive effects of fluoride use. The only significant cost would be in preparing new, low-concentration fluoride products for distribution. RECOMMENDATIONS: Fluoride supplementation should be limited to children 3 years of age and older in areas where there is less than 0. 3 ppm of fluoride in the water supply. Children in all areas should use only a "pea-sized" amount of fluoride dentifrice no more than twice daily under the supervision of an adult. VALIDATION: These recommendations are almost identical to changes to recommendations for the use of fluoride supplements recently proposed by a group of European countries.

40|$|Purpose: This {{laboratory}} study aimed {{to determine whether}} laser activated <b>fluoride</b> (LAF) <b>therapy</b> of sensitive dentine causes conversion of apatite mineral to fluorapatite ("photonic conversion") and thereby {{reduces the risk of}} dental erosion. Materials and Methods: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to quantify changes in the atomic concentration of the elements fluorine, calcium, oxygen, phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon, at five depths up to 52 nm in human dentine slabs with patent dentine tubules, which were either treated with neutral sodium fluoride gel (12, 300 ppm) only, untreated, or subjected to laser-activated fluorid therapy (LAF) over a 12 -week period. Results: Fluorine to calcium ratios were increased from zero (control) to 0. 27 and 0. 28 after fluoride gel and LAF, respectively. However, the chemical composition of dentine was affected by LAF, with the altered fluorine binding energy of 684. 6 eV corresponding to formation of fluorapatite. No conversion to fluorapatite occurred when fluoride gel was applied under identical conditions but without lasing. Conclusion: Partial conversion of apatite minerals with LAF would contribute to the documented protective effects of LAF against dental erosion, and explains the benefits gained clinically when this treatment is applied to sensitive cervical root surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Corticosteroid (CS) {{therapy is}} widely used in the {{treatment}} of rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis remains one of its major complications. The risk of low bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture may be already increased in some of the rheumatic diseases, regardless of CS therapy. However, in spite of this, preventative treatment for osteoporosis in patients on CS remains low. Patients on or about to start CS use for more than 6 months are at risk of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (CIOP). The pathogenesis of CIOP differs from post-menopausal osteoporosis in that bone formation is said to be more suppressed compared with bone resorption.

40|$|Prevention {{of dental}} disease and {{conservation}} of tooth structure are integral principles of modern dental practice. With greater retention of teeth, {{the incidence of}} root surface erosion and root surface caries is on the rise, and is commonly seen in everyday clinical practice. There has been extensive research on the individual effectiveness of photo-activated disinfection (PAD), laser activated <b>fluoride</b> (LAF) <b>therapy,</b> and treatments with casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP). Despite the positive results from in vitro investigations, in vivo studies are required to demonstrate the true degree and extent of clinical effectiveness. It is only in such a setting that the therapy is placed in context {{of all of the}} biological, social and behavioural processes which may affect its outcome. Furthermore, no in vivo study has investigated the potential of combined use of these therapies in reducing root surface erosion-induced hypersensitivity or stabilising incipient root surface caries. This is of great clinical importance and relevance, if progress and advancement are to be achieved in clinical practice. For these reasons, this research study includes a randomised controlled clinical pilot study that investigates the therapeutic effect of combined CPP-ACP, LAF and PAD therapies in alleviating root surface erosion-induced hypersensitivity and stabilising root surface caries. The findings of the in vivo study clearly illustrate the great success and effectiveness of these combined therapies in alleviating hypersensitivity and stabilising root surface caries. This is further substantiated with SEM images clearly showing occlusion of the dentine tubules. The second part of the thesis investigates the potential of Laser Activated <b>Fluoride</b> (LAF) <b>therapy</b> as a protective therapy. Much of the previous literature on LAF therapy has explored its preventive effect on enamel against cariogenic acids, however with an increase in the incidence of erosive lesions, the potential of LAF therapy for use against a strong erosive challenge is a critical point. Consequently, this study includes an in vitro investigation of the protective potential of LAF therapy against a strong erosive challenge (hydrochloric acid). The results show that LAF therapy can be successfully utilised to provide protection to tooth structure against a strong erosive challenge. Moreover, while LAF therapy has been successful when undertaken with the Argon Ion laser wavelengths of laser light, the dependency of its success on a specific wavelength of laser light has not hitherto been investigated. It is essential to determine the influence of the wavelength parameter on the effectiveness of this therapy, and in particular the possible utility of this therapy when used with a broader (visible and near infrared) spectrum of light. Furthermore, this exploration should also extend to the application of a non-coherent source of light, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). For these reasons, this research work includes in vitro studies investigating the importance of the wavelength and coherency parameters on the effectiveness, and success, of LAF therapy. These studies clearly show that LAF therapy can be successfully carried out with a wide spectrum of wavelength of laser light, with the coherency parameter crucial to its effectiveness. Finally, the exact mechanism by which the LAF protective effect is attained in dentine needs to be elucidated. An XPS analysis of dentine treated with LAF, under in vitro conditions, is also presented in the thesis. The results of this study clearly show phase transformation of hydroxyapatite to fluorapatite following treatment of dentine with LAF therapy. The first two chapters of the thesis presents an overview of the existing literature on root surface erosion, root surface caries, LAF, PAD and CPP-ACP therapies. Chapter 3 identifies the aims, objective and hypothesis, while Chapters 4 through to 9 present the findings of the in vivo and in vitro studies.

The polarization resistance of Ti 36 in normal saline containing fluoride decreases by one order of magnitude as compared to that of pure normal saline just on immersion whereas the difference increases to three orders of magnitude after 240 hours of immersion. This is because at longer immersion times, the fluoride ion is able to interfere in the anodic dissolution process, resulting in a significant increase in anodic current density.
