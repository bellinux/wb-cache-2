40|$|To {{explore the}} {{biosystematics}} of the Calligonum mongolicum complex (Polygonaceae), the flowering phenological period, breeding and pollination characters and seed {{set of the}} complex (C. Mongolicum Turze, C. chinense A. Los., C. gobicum A. Los., C. pumilum A. Los. and C. zaidamense A. Los.) were documented in the Turpan <b>Eremophyte</b> Botanical Garden, China. The sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS and ETS region were employed to differentiate the C. mongolicum complex and other species in sect. Medusae. The results showed species of the C. mongolicum complex occupied overlapping flowering periods and had consistent pollination agents. Their breeding systems are all self-compatible, tend to be out-crossing and they interbreed amongst each other (out-crossing index, OCI = 4). The crosses within and amongst species had high seed sets (44 - 65 %). Phylogenetic analyses of Calligonum sect. Medusae and the network analysis of nrDNA (ITS and ETS) in the complex suggest interbreeding amongst "species" within the complex and provide evidence for taxonomically merging the five species in the complex. The detected hybridisation, occurring within the complex, suggests {{the need to improve}} traditional methods of ex situ plant conservation in botanical gardens for maintaining genetic diversity of Calligonum within and amongst species from different geographic areas...|$|E
40|$|H(+) -translocating {{inorganic}} pyrophosphatases (H(+) -PPase) {{were recognized}} as the original energy donors {{in the development of}} plants. A large number of researchers have shown that H(+) -PPase could be an early-originated protein that participated in many important biochemical and physiological processes. In this study we cloned 14 novel sequences from 7 eremophytes: Sophora alopecuroid (Sa), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Gu), Glycyrrhiza inflata (Gi), Suaeda salsa (Ss), Suaeda rigida (Sr), Halostachys caspica (Hc), and Karelinia caspia (Kc). These novel sequences included 6 ORFs and 8 fragments, and they were identified as H(+) -PPases based on the typical conserved domains. Besides the identified domains, sequence alignment showed that there still were two novel conserved motifs. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, including the 14 novel H(+) -PPase amino acid sequences and the other 34 identified H(+) -PPase protein sequences representing plants, algae, protozoans and bacteria. It was shown that these 48 H(+) -PPases were classified into two groups: type I and type II H(+) -PPase. The novel 14 <b>eremophyte</b> H(+) -PPases were classified into the type I H(+) -PPase. The 3 D structures of these H(+) -PPase proteins were predicted, which suggested that all type I H(+) -PPases from higher plants and algae were homodimers, while other type I H(+) -PPases from bacteria and protozoans and all type II H(+) -PPases were monomers. The 3 D structures of these novel H(+) -PPases were homodimers except for SaVP 3, which was a monomer. This regular structure could provide important evidence for the evolutionary origin and study {{of the relationship between the}} structure and function among members of the H(+) -PPase family...|$|E
40|$|Capparis spinosa L. is a {{perennial}} <b>eremophyte</b> shrub, widely distributed in Mediterranean Europe: in Italy {{it is commonly}} found as a ruderal species growing on and covering walls of the cities. Its highly developed root and xylem systems are the reason {{of its ability to}} survive in both cold and heat stressed environments, as they confer the plant the capability of using the groundwater resources (Yin et al., 2014) and the ability of growing on very dry spots, like walls and rocky coastal areas (Kulisic-Bilusic et al., 2010). We analysed the spontaneous volatile emission of different aerial parts of caper (Capparis spinosa L.) by means of HS-SPME-GC/MS. The samples included leaves, buds, sepals, seeds, fruits, pistils, stamens, petals and flowers; they were randomly collected from specimens growing as wild, ruderal plants on the medieval walls of Pisa (Italy). We identified 178 different compounds of which, in different proportion based on the type of sample, the main ones were (E) -β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, linalool, β-caryophyllene, α- guaiene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, germacrene B, (E) -nerolidol, isopropyl tetradecanoate and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone. We carried the multivariate statistical analysis of the results, with both the HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The analyses seem {{to point out that the}} parameter leading the emission patterns is the function of the studied sample: the flowers samples showed differences in the emission profile between their fertile and sterile portion, and between the other parts of the plant. The green parts emission profiles group them together in a cluster of their own and they are different from those of seeds and fruits. Furthermore, we hydrodistilled caper fully bloomed flowers and analysed its composition. Literature reports analyses of the essential oil of caper seeds (Ara et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2014), fruits (Afsharypuor et al., 1998; Yin et al., 2014), roots (Afsharypuor et al., 1998), leaves (Afsharypuor et al., 1998) and floral buds (Kulisic-Bilusic et al., 2010). The bloomed flowers essential oil volatile profile significantly differs from those of the essential oils obtained from other parts of Capparis spinosa reported in the literature: it is the only volatile oil rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (mainly (E) -nerolidol and (E) -nerolidol acetate) and oxygenated monoterpenes (mainly linalool) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{observed}} the flowering phenology, breeding system, pollination and seed germination of four species of Calligonum (C. calliphysa, C. rubicundum, C. densum and C. ebinuricum) in the Turpan <b>Eremophytes</b> Botanic Garden, China. Our {{results showed that}} the species had overlapping flowering phenologies and were pollinated by similar pollination agents. Their breeding systems were self-compatible, and with signs of outbreeding, but not of hybridization with each other; the main isolation mechanism was post-zygotic isolation and they also had high seed germination rates. Therefore, they are suited to ex situ conservation in the Turpan <b>Eremophytes</b> Botanic Garden, and can supply sufficient seeds for renewal populations and the conservation of germplasm resources. Furthermore, these results provide theoretical support {{for the construction of a}} national germplasm resource garden of Calligonum, and for the introduction to the garden of other eremophyteplants and their conservation...|$|R
40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. Capparis spinosa {{is one of}} the most {{important}} <b>eremophytes</b> among the medicinal plants, and continued destruction of these plants poses a major threat to species survival. The development of methods to extract compounds, especially those of medicinal value, without harvesting the whole plant is an issue of considerable socioeconomic importance. On the basis of an established system for culture of suspension cells and callus in vitro, Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the volatile oil composition analyzing in seed, fruit, suspension cells and callus. Fatty acids were the major component, and the highest content of alkanes was detected in seed, with, 1. 0 % in suspension cells and callus. Esters, olefins and heterocyclic compounds were significantly higher in fruit than in the other materials. The content of acid esters in the suspension cells and callus was significantly higher than in seed and fruit. This indicated that the suspension cells and callus could be helpful for increasing the value of volatile oil and replacin...|$|R

The content of acid esters in the suspension cells and callus was significantly higher than in seed and fruit. This indicated that the suspension cells and callus could be helpful for increasing the value of volatile oil and replacing seeds and fruit partially as a source of some compounds of the volatile oil and may also produce some new medical compounds. The above results give valuable information for sustainable use of C. spinosa and provide a foundation for use of the C. spinosa suspension cells and callus as an ongoing medical resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} sex {{allocation}} {{can be used}} to predict the optimal allocation of reproductive resources and considered as individual fitness between male and female function. Variations in resource allocation be-tween sexes and among different positions in the flower inflorescence have great significance for under-standing how choice of reproductive strategy affects reproductive success. Changes in floral sex allocation among different positions, pollinator movement and reproductive success within sequentially flowering in-florescences of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus were studied at the Turpan <b>Eremophytes</b> Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Our major results are as follows: (1) Floral longevity shortened signifi-cantly, stamen mass/(stamen mass + pistil mass), pollen number and pollen/ovule ratio all increased among positions along with the turn of intermediate earlier developing flowers→lower flowers→upper later devel-oping flowers. Corolla diameter, corolla mass and nectar production, on the other hand, all diminished and ovule number showed no differences. Upper flowers showed male-biased sex allocation; (2) Within an inflo-rescence, Apis mellifera and Lasiglossum sp. 1 landed first on the intermediate flowers, moved among different positions in the inflorescence, and finally flew away from the upper flower. Intermediate flowers had the highest first visiting rate but lowest last visiting rate while upper flowers had the lowest last visiting rate but highest first visiting rate; (3) During the two years of our study, the seed set rate and seed weight increased after supplying outcross pollen to the upper flowers; the fruit set rate, seed set rate and seed weight all in-creased significantly after simultaneously supplying outcross pollen to the upper flowers and removing the intermediate and lower flowers, and these measures did not differ between the two treatments. These results suggested that lower fruit set, seed set and seed weight of upper flowers under natural conditions can be at-tributed to the pollinators’ directionality within inflorescence and a lack of outcrossing pollen in upper flow-ers rather than resource limitation in A. mongolicus. Increasing investment in male functions on the upper fowers may be an adaptive strategy to sustain pollination success for the species...|$|R
