40|$|The {{effects of}} {{physical}} aging {{on the water}} permeation of cellulose acetate and ethylcellulose, the mechanical properties of ethylcellulose, and the dissolution property of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> were investigated. The water permeabilities of cellulose acetate and ethylcellulose and the dissolution rate of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> were found to decrease with physical aging time after being quenched from above the glass transition temperatures to sub- T g temperatures. The gradual approach toward thermodynamic equilibrium during physical aging decreases the free volume of the polymers. This decrease in free volume {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in the transport mobility, with concomitant changes in those properties of the polymer that depend on it. The effects of long-term aging on the dissolution rate and water permeabilities of these polymers can be estimated from a linear double-logarithmic relationship between the mobility properties and physical aging time. The existence of the linear double-logarithmic relationship can be derived from the Williams–Landel–Ferry (1) equation, the Doolittle (2) equation, Struik's (3) model, and Fujita's (4) relationship between diffusion and free volume...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a once daily {{sustained}} release tablet of aceclofenac using chitosan and an enteric coating polymer (<b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> or cellulose acetate phthalate). Overall sustained release for 24  h was achieved by preparing a double-layer tablet in which the immediate release layer was formulated for a prompt release of the drug and the sustained release layer was designed to achieve a prolonged release of drug. The preformulation studies like IR spectroscopic and differential scanning calorimetry showed the absence of drug–excipient interactions. The tablets were found within the permissible limits for various physicochemical parameters. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the surface morphology of the tablets and to confirm drug release mechanisms.

Three excipients, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), spray-dried lactose monohydrate, and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, were individually blended with 0. 5 % magnesium stearate, as a lubricant, and 2. 5 % tetracycline HCl, as a fluorescent marker, and were compressed using a Carver press. Tablets were coated with a solution consisting of 7 % <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> (HPMC) <b>phthalate</b> (HP- 55), and 0. 5 % cetyl alcohl in acetone and isopropanol (11 : 9). The nature of polymer interaction with the tablets and coating was evaluated using CLSM and a designed magnet probe test. CLSM images clearly showed coating efficiency, thickness, and uniformity of film formation, and the extent of drug migration into the film at the coating interfaces of tablets. Among the excipients, MCC demonstrated the best interface for both film formation and uniformity in thickness relative to lactose monohydrate and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. The detachment force of the coating layers from the tablet surfaces, as measured with the developed magnet probe test, was in the order of MCC>lactose monohydrate>dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.

40|$|CONTEXT: Endoscopic mucosal {{resection}} is {{an established}} modality for excision of sessile lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Submucosal fluid injection creates a cushion and may prevent thermal injury and perforation. OBJECTIVES: This blind {{study investigated the}} performance of three different solutions to create submucosal fluid cushions in porcine stomach. METHODS: Three solutions were injected in the stomach of nine pigs BR 1 : normal saline solution, carboxymethylcellulose 0. 5 % and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> 0. 25 %. In each pig, submucosal injections with 6 mL per test-solution were performed. One drop of methylene blue was added to all injections for better visualization. The time for the bleb to disappear was recorded. RESULTS: The overall median time of visible submucosal cushion was 37 minutes (range 12 - 60 min) for <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose,</b> 31 minutes for carboxymethylcellulose (range 10 - 43 min) and 19 minutes for normal saline solution (range 8 - 37 min).

The {{objective of the}} present study was to prepare submicron particulate formulations of papain for pH-dependent site-specific release using pH-sensitive polymers. Methods: Enteric submicron particle formulations of papain were prepared by w/o/w emulsion solvent evaporation using <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> (HPMCP), Eudragit L 100, and Eudragit S 100, to avoid gastric inactivation of papain. Results: Smaller internal and external aqueous phase volumes provided maximum encapsulation efficiency (75. 58 %&ndash; 82. 35 %), the smallest particle size (665. 6 &ndash; 692. 4 nm), and 25 %&ndash; 30 % loss of enzyme activity. Release studies in 0. 1 N HCl confirmed the gastroresistance of the formulations. The anionic submicron particles aggregated in 0. 1 N HCl (ie, gastric pH 1. 2) due to protonation of carboxylic groups in the enteric polymer. Aggregates &lt; 500 &micro;m size would not impede gastric emptying. However, at pH &gt; 5. 0 (duodenal pH), the submicron particles showed deaggregation due to restoration of surface charge. HPMCP submicron particles facilitated almost complete release of papain within 30 minutes at pH 6. 0, while Eudragit L 100 and Eudragit S 100 particles released 88. 82 % and 53. 00 % of papain at pH 6. 8 and pH 7. 4, respectively, according to the Korsmeyer&ndash;Peppas equation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that the structural integrity of the enzyme was maintained during encapsulation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed entrapment of the enzyme, with powder x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry indicating an amorphous character, and scanning electron microscopy showing that the submicron particles had a spherical shape. Conclusion: In simulated gastrointestinal pH conditions, the HPMCP, Eudragit L 100, and Eudragit S 100 submicron particles showed good digestion of paneer and milk protein, and could serve as potential carriers for oral enzyme delivery.

3000|$|... pH-sensitive {{polymers}} {{have been}} developed and introduced into the particulate carriers to circumvent the barriers for oral insulin delivery. As early as 1999, insulin was formulated with pH-sensitive microparticles, and a prolonged reduction of hyperglycemia was observed after oral administration to diabetic rats [7]. This reduction was dose dependent and lasted up to 8 [*]h with a dose of 25 [*]IU/kg of encapsulated insulin. These results were confirmed by pH-responsive hydrogel particles and demonstrated a similar manner in the reduction of blood glucose level after oral administration of polymeric dosage form and direct injection of insulin [8, 9]. Generally, nanoparticles have greater intracellular uptake compared with microparticles and are available to a greater range of biologic targets due to their smaller size and mobility [10]. Depending on the pH-sensitive polymer combinations, nanoparticles can be tailored to control release kinetics, facilitate the uptake of insulin, and increase the oral bioavailability [11, 12]. Various pH-sensitive nanoparticles based on pH-sensitive polymers were developed for oral delivery of insulin. These pH-sensitive polymers include polymethacrylic acid [13 – 18], <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> (HPMCP(HP 55)) [19], dextran sulphate [20 – 23], alginate [21, 24], poly-γ-glutamic acid [25, 26], and so on. Generally, these formulations prepared with these pH-sensitive polymers, orally administered mostly to diabetic rats, induced a different extent reduction in blood glucose level.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Organic drugs {{including}} aspirin, omeprazole, and naproxen {{with three}} different levels of octanol/water partition coefficient were examined for their release behavior from the amphiphilic PCL-b-PEO-b-PCL (PCEC) matrix. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of PCEC illustrated a well defined two-phase morphology consisted of dispersed poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) domain and continuous polycaprolactone (PCL) phase. Differential scan-ning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) experiments verified that three model drugs are dissolved as a molecular dispersion in PCEC matrix. The release of hydrophilic aspirin closely followed the water absorption profile of the matrix indicating that its major fraction is present in PEO domain. However, substantial amount of aspi-rin present in less hydrophilic region displayed discontinuous biphasic release pattern. In the case of omeprazole with intermediate hydrophobicity consistent release behavior was observed {{for a period of}} 24 hrs after the rapid lib-eration of ca. 10 % of the drug presumably partitioned in PEO phase. It was ascribed {{to the fact that the}} progressive hydration of PCEC matrix gradually increased the chance of drug/water exposure to compensate the exhaustion of device. Naproxen with the highest octanol/water distribution coefficient among three model drugs exhibited a lim-ited release of 35 % for 24 hrs.

The enteric capsule was coated with pH-sensitive <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> (HP 55), which could selectively release insulin from nanoparticles in the intestinal tract, instead of stomach. The biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) {{was selected as the}} matrix for loading insulin. Eurdragit ® RS (RS) was also introduced to the nanoparticles for enhancing the penetration of insulin across the mucosal surface in the intestine. The nanoparticles were prepared with the multiple emulsions solvent evaporation method via ultrasonic emulsification. The optimized nanoparticles have a mean size of 285 nm, a positive zeta potential of 42 mV. The encapsulation efficiency was up to 73. 9 %. In vitro results revealed that the initial burst release of insulin from nanoparticles was markedly reduced at pH 1. 2, which mimics the stomach environment. In vivo effects of the capsule containing insulin PLGA/RS nanoparticles were also investigated in diabetic rat models. The oral delivered capsules induced a prolonged reduction in blood glucose levels. The pharmacological availability was found to be approximately 9. 2 %. All the results indicated that the integration of HP 55 -coated capsule with cationic nanoparticles may be a promising platform for oral delivery of insulin with high bioavailability. © 2012 Elsevier B.

There is still a high demand on efficient methods to fabricate microparticles with uniform sizes and well-controlled particle properties. In this paper, uniform <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> <b>phthalate</b> (HPMCP) -based pharmaceutical microparticles loaded with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic model drugs have been directly formulated by using a unique aerosol technique, i. e., the microfluidic spray drying technology. A series of microparticles of controllable particle sizes, shapes, and structures are fabricated by tuning the solvent composition and drying temperature. It is found that a more volatile solvent and a higher drying temperature can result in fast evaporation rates to form microparticles of larger lateral size, more irregular shape, and denser matrix.

The drug release behaviors of the pharmaceutical microparticles are dependent on their structural properties and the nature of a specific drug, as well as sensitive to the pH value of the release medium.

40|$|Abstract Gastroretentive {{floating}} microparticles {{were developed}} and evaluated for the controlled metronidazole delivery {{for treatment of}} gastric disease. Floating microparticles, varying in proportions of chitosan and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> or ethylcellulose, were obtained by spray drying. Floating microparticles were characterized by physicochemical and in vitro studies, according to their floating ability and drug delivery. Microparticles presented mean diameter from 1. 05 to 2. 20 µm. The infrared spectroscopy confirmed the drug encapsulation and showed no chemical linkage between microparticles components. X-ray diffraction showed changes in the drug`s solid state, from crystalline to amorphous, indicating partial drug encapsulation, due {{to the presence of}} some crystalline peaks of metronidazole in microparticles. All microparticles floated immediately in contact of simulated gastric fluid and both floating and drug release profiles were dependent of microparticles composition. Microparticles samples constituted by chitosan and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> revealed the best relationship between floating duration and drug release, remaining floating during the occurrence of the drug release, ideal condition for the floating gastroretentive systems...|$|R
40|$|There is keen {{interest}} in developing improved drug delivery systems to gastro intestinal tract for treatment of H. pylori induced peptic and duodenal ulcers, {{in the present study}} an attempt has been made to develop and evaluate gastroretentive matrix tablets of clarithromycin which were prepared by using <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>Methylcellulose</b> K 4 M (HPMC K 4 M), Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose K 15 M (HPMC K 15 M) and <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>Methylcellulose</b> K 100 M (HPMC K 100 M) with NaHCO 3 as gas forming agent. Tablets were prepared by direct compression using directly compressible polymers such as HPMC K 4 M, HPMC K 15 M and HPMC K 100 M and were evaluated for drug - excipient compatibility, buoyancy test, tablet density, drug content and in-vitro release profile. Sodium bicarbonate was used for producing effervescent base for buoyancy of tablets. The release rate determined in 0. 1 N HCL (pH 1. 2) showed controlled release of drug following non-Fickian mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} an ampholytic {{surfactant}} on the swelling properties of polymeric materials was studied, using various swelling liquids. Tablets were prepared consisting of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose,</b> poly(oxyethylene) and sodium alginate. Tego betain was the non-ionic surfactant {{used as an}} additive {{in a series of}} samples made of the above polymers. Those tablets were immersed in distilled water, phosphate buffer and 0. 1 N HCl, and their weight uptake was recorded as a function of time, in order to assess the swelling process. Measurements of the contact angle of the above systems were also carried out for estimating their wetting properties. The results of this study showed a selectivity among polymers, surfactant and surrounding liquid. Clearly, an enhancement of the swelling capacity of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> tablets due to the surfactant was recorded. An unclear effect was observed in the case of poly(oxyethylene), whereas for sodium alginate, the dominant factor is its water solubility that controls swelling behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulations}} {{consisting of}} a hydrophilic and hydrophobic material were investigated for effect on drug-release pattern from the matrices. Gum damar and gum copal being water-insoluble were used to study the efficiency of combined matrices to sustain the release of drug. <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> K 100 M and diclofenac sodium were used as the hydrophilic material and model drug, respectively. The influence of concentration of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> on drug release pattern of hydrophobic material was determined. The optimum ratio of drug: polymer {{was found to be}} 1 : 1. The hydrophobic:hydrophilic polymer ratio of 75 : 25 was found to have a similar release pattern as that of marketed formulation. At this ratio, the initial burst-release that occurred in individual hydrophobic matrices was lowered to a great extent. The release of drug was found to follow Higuchi′s equation as the concentration of hydrophobic material was increased. The formulations were compared with marketed formulation Voveran SR, and a correlation was drawn accordingly...|$|R
50|$|Tablet {{coatings}} protect tablet ingredients from deterioration by {{moisture in}} the air and make large or unpleasant-tasting tablets easier to swallow. For most coated tablets, a cellulose ether <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> (HPMC) film coating is used which is free of sugar and potential allergens. Occasionally, other coating materials are used, for example synthetic polymers, shellac, corn protein zein or other polysaccharides. Capsules are coated with gelatin.|$|R
