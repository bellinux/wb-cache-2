Vidal takes the baby from her arms and fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is {{surrounded}} by the rebels who have taken over the outpost.

Mercedes replies that the child will never <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as his name. Her brother Pedro kills Vidal.|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to do something and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months or so. He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than I was three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, Margules {{began work}} as a police {{reporter}} for the City News Association of New York [...] Margules then considered himself something of an expert on art, and the painter Myron Lechay {{is said to have}} responded to some unsolicited analysis of his work with the remark [...] "Since you seem to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about it, why don't you paint yourself?"

[...] "I always {{wanted to live in}} New York City, so that was a dream come true!" [...] She added that [...] "New York has so much culture" [...] and she had been able to grow as a person and actor. [...] "It's good that you can be given a script and learn 40 pages and feel comfortable with that. You get to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about the character that you don't question things, you just do it instantaneously," [...] she said.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when you <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> happened that was so bad to so many people. But there were things I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{always a}} nice feeling. Sometimes {{you hear it}} on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something… it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an {{interview}} {{about a year ago}} with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America… which I didn't <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it." ...|$|E
