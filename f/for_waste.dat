5|$|In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act {{called for}} {{creation}} of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility. Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|The City of Lock Haven {{owns the}} {{reservoirs}} and water distribution system for Wayne Township, Castanea Township, and the city.

Lock Haven operates a sewage treatment plant <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> water, industrial waste, and trucked sewage {{from the city and}} eight upstream municipalities: Bald Eagle Township, Castanea, Flemington, Lamar, Mill Hall, Porter Township, Woodward Township, and Walker Township in Centre County. Storm water runoff from within the city is transported by city-owned storm sewers. Curbside pickup of household garbage is provided by a variety of local haulers licensed by the city; recyclables are picked up once every two weeks.

5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E

40|$|EU {{landfill}} directive defines {{three categories}} of landfills: landfills <b>for</b> inert <b>waste,</b> <b>for</b> normal <b>waste</b> and <b>for</b> hazardous <b>waste.</b> Criteria <b>for</b> which <b>waste</b> may be disposed at each type of landfill are also given. They consist primarily in limit values for the leaching of inorganic components. It is however possible to allow higher limit values <b>for</b> specific <b>waste</b> and components. However, this requires a risk assessment to demonstrate that this represents no additional risks to the environment. This report provides guidance on possible approaches to a risk assessment in cases where deviations from the landfill regulations are considered and to point out key issues {{to be taken into}} account. A proposal for an approach {{to be used in the}} impact assessment is presented. The focus is primarily on inorganic constituents. The results of this project may be used in the development of national guidelines on deviation from EU landfill criteria...|$|R
