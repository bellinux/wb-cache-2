5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies, like Miami, {{entered the}} 1980 season after accumulating a 56 record in 1979.

Tech was coached by Bill Dooley, who was entering his third season as head coach.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E

5|$|The Florida State Seminoles {{ended the}} 1998 college {{football}} {{season with a}} 2316 loss to the Tennessee Volunteers in the 1999 Fiesta Bowl, which was the national championship game that year. The loss was only {{the second of the}} season for Florida State, which had entered the game ranked No. 2 and favored against the No. 1 ranked Volunteers. Florida State players and coaches entered the off-season hoping to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> their runner-up finish in the national championship game the year before, and were voted the No. 1 team in the country in the annual Associated Press preseason poll.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets {{entered the}} 2009 season after a 2008 {{campaign}} that saw them finish 9–4, including a season-ending 38–3 {{loss to the}} LSU Tigers in the 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl. Georgia Tech head coach Paul Johnson, entering his second season {{as head of the}} Yellow Jackets, had high hopes that Georgia Tech would be able to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> its 2008 performance. Others agreed with Johnson's assumption, as the Yellow Jackets were ranked No. 15 in the preseason Associated Press and USA Today coaches' polls.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Kclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-4 tank {{locomotive}} {{designed in}} 1914 by Richard Maunsell for express passenger duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower loading gauge. They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The locomotives were based on the GWR 4300class, improved by the Midland Railway's ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance.|$|E

5|$|The SECR Nclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-0 ("mogul") steam {{locomotive}} designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR).

The Nclass was based on the GWR 4300 Class design, improved with Midland Railway concepts.|$|E
5|$|The demises of the Theological Repository and the New Review left a {{publishing}} vacuum; the arrival in London {{of the author}} Thomas Christie, who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> these precursors, was the primary impetus {{in the creation of}} the Analytical Review. Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of the Analytical Review.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld II began {{production}} in April 1992, {{shortly after the}} completion of Ultima Underworld; and it was developed in nine months. The team sought to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> the foundation laid by the game's predecessor, particularly by increasing the size and interactivity of the game world. The team reused and improved the first game's engine. Development was impeded by insufficient staffing and extensive playtesting, and the rapid production cycle led to burnout on the team.|$|E

5|$|Baldur's Gate II, {{taking place}} {{south of the}} events of Baldur's Gate, is set in the country of Amn, mainly in and around the city of Athkatla. The game opens shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate and {{continues}} the story of the protagonist, Gorion's Ward, whose unique heritage has now gained them the attention of the mage Jon Irenicus. The game's plot revolves around the machinations of Irenicus and the protagonist's encounters with him. The game's development began in January 1999. BioWare set out to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> the first Baldur's Gate in every way possible. From a list of constructive criticism (compiled from the suggestions of fans, reviews, and internal suggestions) a list of features {{to be added to the}} game was distilled: some of these were 800 x 600 resolution, 3D support, and character kits. In Baldur's Gate, the game's engine and content were being developed at the same time; whereas in Baldur's Gate II, the engine was running from the start.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which {{was supposed to be a}} rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of DAB is that due {{to the use of}} multiplexing technology and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. DAB radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20µg) required to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> the IPK.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{turnaround}} from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season turnaround in school history and was the second-best {{in the country that}} year. Tech hoped to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> a 14 all-time record in bowl games, while Indiana hoped to do likewise for its 34 historical bowl-game record. In the week prior to the game, bad weather in Virginia caused travel delays that prevented many fans and the Virginia Tech marching band from arriving at the game early. Two days prior to the Independence Bowl, Tech was shocked by the death of Dr. Richard Bullock, who served as the team's physician from 1971 to 1988. Bullock designed a special football neck protector worn by players during the 1980s and 1990s before being phased out in favor of more advanced padding.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} of the Centenary Stand, the Spion Kop was redeveloped {{for the start of the}} 1994–95 season. The stand became all-seater, retaining the single tier with a reduced capacity of 12,000. In Evans's first full season in charge Liverpool finished in fourth place, their best finish since the departure of Dalglish. The club reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, before losing 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur and reached the 1995 Football League Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers. Two goals from Steve McManaman helped Liverpool to a 2–1 victory as they won their fifth League Cup. The season also saw several long-serving players leave the club, as Grobbelaar, Nicol and Ronnie Whelan departed. Before the start of the 1995–96 season, Liverpool signalled their intent to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> the previous season, signing forward Stan Collymore for a British club record £8.5million. Collymore scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday in the first game of the season. Liverpool finished in third place. They reached the final of the FA Cup against Manchester United; an 85th-minute goal from Eric Cantona secured a 1–0 victory for United.|$|E
5|$|Again {{following}} {{the pattern of}} 2010, Roche also rode the Vuelta as Ag2r's squad leader. He hoped to <b>improve</b> <b>upon</b> both his dismal Tour, which he admitted was hampered by a crash sustained shortly beforehand at the Critérium du Dauphiné, and his seventh overall in the 2010 Vuelta. Their performance in the third Grand Tour team time trial of the season was even worse than the first two, as they were a paltry 19th of 22, immediately putting Roche 42 seconds off the pace. Roche led the peloton {{across the finish line}} in stage 3, but since it was for fifth place after breakaway riders took all the time bonuses, it had no substantial effect on his overall placing. Roche showed strongly on the Valdepeñas de Jaén climb in stage 5, finishing just 7 seconds behind stage winner Joaquim Rodríguez. However, since this final climb was rather short, time gaps were small throughout the field, and this performance only gained Roche one place in the overall standings, moving him up to 25th. Stage 8 proved largely similar, as Rodríguez again won on a short, steep final climb, and Roche finished in the top ten on the day, 15 seconds back this time. He gained two places with this ride. Mondory contested two of the field sprints in the race's first week, but did not come particularly close to winning either, finishing eighth and then seventh in stages 2 and 7 respectively.|$|E
