40|$|Art {{is like a}} person—organic, complex, and emotional. Art’s {{differences}} {{cannot be}} defined by intellectual labels that only loosely describe what a viewer sees or feels {{in a piece of}} art. Only the artist has a full understanding of how a piece came to be, from the inception to the fully finished product. Once it leaves the artist’s hands, all the labels and analysis may stretch its meaning far from its original intention. So here I am, trying to blur the lines between the labels—specifically between art and fashion. Where does the art end and the design begin? Do I need to plan from start to finish, or can I create through a series of spontaneous actions and unconscious decisions? Why is a person drawn to something, and how can I become part of the creation of that product? Part of my process with art is tossing aside any process. I feel that I need only time to create a product: given enough time, I will have something to show for it. I know what I want in the end: to define a brand that is uniquely me.

I have made a survey study of satisfaction and attitudes among the consumers of a public transportation company in Växjö; Länstrafken Kronoberg. The results from the empirical study have shown that public transportation is significant for society and the environment. Nevertheless, it appears that people are not willing to sacrifice the convenience of using the car for the cause of the environment; passengers would not give up their daily routines.

First, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> recruit traditional high-achieving freshman students to a university honors program that, as of fall 2013, did not exist. Second, because GSU has never had freshmen, the university and its honors program were little-known among local high school populations. Third, the typical GSU undergraduate student in 2013 – 14 —average age 31. 5, Generation X, non-traditional (University Fast Facts) —was a stark contrast to the type of student I was recruiting—average age 17 – 18, Millennial, traditional—and was not a good fit to provide guidance on the needs and interests of the forthcoming traditional freshman population. Fourth, past scholarship suggests that minorities are an underrepresented population in honors programs (McKay) while GSU serves the ethnically diverse Chicago Southland with a population of 2. 5 million (Chicago Southland News).

First and foremost was {{the question of why}} I am able to enter this state without any preparation. The second was the obvious question of how does this work. Over some years people had asked to sit and talk with me about their problems, despite the fact that I have no training whatsoever in counselling or any other therapies. This was the early eighties and seminars on just about everything under the sun were on offer. I joined a ten day residential for Vipassana meditation and after sitting meditating for ten days I was no different and life continued as usual. It was obvious that most of those I listened to thought I was some kind of healer, others said I was a good listener, while some asked me to teach them to do what I did. My position was that I could not possibly, or ethically, teach something that I didn’t know anything about. Not about how it worked, if it worked, why it worked and what was it that I did. At one point I was asked what I would do next, and to my surprise I said I would not do any more of this because <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out how it worked. So began this long undirected journey into thinking and consciousness. In the Yoga tradition, buddhi is consciousness in its own right and has been defined by some writers as acognitive knowing. My view is that acognitive knowing means knowing without the mind, and of course that is what Samapatti provides to the seer. And what this means in our seeking to understand consciousness is precisely what I referred to. There are possibly a number of models we could posit to accommodate this position, all of which would be counterintuitive for science.
