50|$|In {{the female}} the Wolffian bodies and ducts atrophy. The {{nonfunctional}} {{remains of the}} Wolffian tubules are represented by the <b>epoophoron,</b> and the paroöphoron, two small collections of rudimentary blind tubules which are situated in the mesosalpinx.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>epoophoron</b> {{is located}} in the lateral portion of the mesosalpinx and mesovarium, the paroophoron (residual remnant of that part of the Mesonephric duct that forms the paradidymis in the male) lies more medially in the mesosalpinx.|$|E
50|$|It {{may contain}} 10-15 {{transverse}} small ducts or tubules {{that lead to}} the Gartner’s duct (also longitudinal duct of <b>epoophoron)</b> that represents the caudal remnant of the Mesonephric duct and passes through the broad ligament and the lateral wall of the cervix and vagina.|$|E
50|$|The paroophoron (of Johnson) {{consists}} of a few scattered rudimentary tubules, best seen in the child, situated in the broad ligament between the <b>epoöphoron</b> and the uterus. Named for the Welsh anatomist David Johnson who originally described the structure at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>epoöphoron</b> {{lies in the}} mesosalpinx {{between the}} ovary and the uterine tube, and {{consists}} of a few short tubules, the ductuli transversi which converge toward the ovary while their opposite ends open into a rudimentary duct, the ductus longitudinalis epoöphori (duct of Gärtner).|$|E
50|$|Vesicular {{appendages}} of the <b>epoophoron</b> {{are small}} pedunculated vesicles of the fimbriae of the uterine tube, or {{connected to the}} broad ligament. They were described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni and are remnants of the cranial part of the mesonephric duct. Typically they are asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|In the female, {{with the}} absence of anti-Müllerian hormone {{secretion}} by the Sertoli cells and subsequent Müllerian apoptosis, the Wolffian duct regresses, and inclusions may persist. The <b>epoophoron</b> and Skene's glands may be present. Also, lateral {{to the wall of}} the vagina a Gartner's duct or cyst could develop as a remnant.|$|E
50|$|The {{mesonephros}} {{as a whole}} produces urine {{from the}} 6th through the 10th week of development. Despite the similarity in structure, function, and terminology, however, the mesonephric nephrons do not form {{any part of the}} mature kidney or nephrons. As the more caudal nephrons form, the more cranial nephrons are already degenerating. In females the mesonephros degenerates entirely, though vestigial structures such as Gartner's ducts, the <b>epoophoron,</b> and paroophoron are common. In males, a few of the more caudal tubules will survive and give rise to the efferent ductules of the testis, the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, as well as vestigial structures such as the appendix testis, appendix epididymis, and paradidymis.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Oxytocin was {{injected}} once daily into eighteen Hereford heifers over {{a period}} corresponding to several oestrous cycle lengths. Oxytocin was injected at two dose rates (6 or 18 USP units/ 100 lb liveweight) twice in the day (a. m. or p. m.). Pretreatment cycle lengths were recorded to serve as control cycles. Mean oestrous cycle lengths of 19 =., 15 =. and 11 =. days, respectively, (P 0 =. 5). Oxytocin produced epithelial cysts in the fimbria of the infundibulum, in the ampulla of the oviduct and in the mucosa of the endometrium of the uterus. There was mild cystic endometrial hyperplasia of the uterus, and occasional cyst formation in the rete ovarii. The <b>epoophoron</b> was dilated and distinct in many ovaries. Large luteinized follicles, appar-ently cystic, were present at slaughter in four heifers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the female}} embryo large {{portions}} of the mesonephric duct degenerate before birth, ' whereas in the male, the duct remains and is incorporated into the genital system. That which remains in the female forms parts of the urethra and trigone, and contributes to the <b>epoophoron</b> which persists through life. Occasionally the duct remains in the lateral wall of the vagina and uterus as Gartner's duct. All these remnants are subject to cystic and neoplastic change, and it is usually {{as a result of}} such pathology that they are identified and studied. The origin of cysts {{in the vicinity of the}} kidneys has not been clear, but has not been ascribed to remnants of the mesonephric duct. Some observers, however, have described cysts which they have identified as mesonephric rests. 28 Most of these cysts have had no anatomic relationship to any other organ but the kidney, and the cavity has generally been blind, without communications with the renal pelvis. The present report concerns a large retroperitoneal cyst in continuity with the right kidney and the right sid...|$|E
40|$|The Monodelphis oviduct can {{be divided}} into four {{anatomical}} segments: preampulla (comprising fimbriae and infundibulum), ampulla, isthmus with crypts and uterotubal junction. Ovaries are enclosed in a periovarial sac, the bursa, and in some specimens tubules of an <b>epoophoron</b> could be identified. In both structures non-ciliated cells develop small translucent vesicles, which accumulate in the cell apices and presumably produce fluid as often seen in the bursa and in the tubules of the epooophoron. These vesicles do not stain with Alcian blue or PAS. The same applies also to the non-ciliated cells of the fimbriae. The oviducal epithelium of ampulla and the surface epithelium of the isthmus consisting of ciliated and non-ciliated, secretory cells undergo considerable changes during the estrous cycle. Proestrus shows low numbers of ciliated cells, some {{are in the process of}} neo-ciliogenesis, non-ciliated cells carry solitary cilia and few remnant secretory granules from the previous cycle may be found. At estrus the amount of ciliated cells in ampulla and isthmus has increased, most non-cililated cells lost the solitary cilia, developed longer microvilli and formed numerous secretory granules in their cell apices. At postestrus secretory products, often surrounded by membranes, are extruded into the oviducal lumen and contribute towards egg coat formation. First signs of deciliation processes are apparent. Solitary cilia reappear...|$|E
40|$|The {{laying hen}} (Gallus domesticus) is a robust animal model for {{epithelial}} ovarian cancer. The use of animal models {{is critical in}} identifying early disease markers and developing and testing chemotherapies. We describe the microscopic characteristics of the normally functioning laying hen ovary and proximal oviduct to establish baselines from which lesions associated with ovarian cancer can be more readily identified. Ovaries and oviducts were collected from 18 -month-old laying hens (n = 18) and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections were examined by light microscopy. Both post-ovulatory follicular regression and atresia of small follicles produce remnant clusters of vacuolated cells with no histological evidence that scar tissue persists. Infiltrates of heterophils are associated with atresia of small follicles, a relationship not previously documented in laying hen ovaries. Because these tissues can be mistaken for cancerous lesions, we present a detailed histological description of remnant Wolffian tissues in the laying hen ovary. Immunohistochemical staining for pancytokeratin produced a positive response in ovarian surface epithelium and staining for vimentin produced a positive response in granulosa cells of follicles. Epithelial cells lining glands of the remnant <b>epoöphoron</b> had a positive response to both pancytokeratin and vimentin, a result also observed in women...|$|E
