Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman that is secretly in love with Jack, feels that their <b>efforts</b> <b>will</b> end in disaster, but Jack dismisses her and assigns her the task of sewing him a red coat to wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa Claus and {{bring him back to}} Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well.|$|E

25|$|The Government of Argentina (GoA) with World Bank {{assistance}} has {{aimed to}} reduce industrial wastewater discharge (organic {{as well as}} toxic effluents) that directly enter the MR River. Over the next 15–20 years these <b>efforts</b> <b>will</b> contribute to the environmental recovery of the river. They {{will focus on the}} 50 main industrial polluters that contribute ~95% of the total industrial organic load (approximately 70 percent of the total organic load) discharged to the MR River and a further 170 industries with the highest toxic load currently discharged into the MR River. A combination of technical assistance to improve monitoring, control, and enforcement by the MR Basin Authority will be instituted. The idea is to help in collecting baseline data and carry out diagnostic exercises. Support will be provided for private sector investments in pollution control and cleaner production processes, targeting small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that typically pollute more per unit of output and have weaker financial and technical capacity to comply with environmental regulations.|$|E

A report, filed with the Régie de l'énergie, in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of marginal cost pricing with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings.

2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{economic}} effect of Wikipedia {{has been the}} death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, [...] "The amorality of Web 2.0", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because [...] "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: [...] "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." [...] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar <b>efforts,</b> <b>will</b> entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the [...] "wisdom of crowds" [...] approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process.|$|E

They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
2500|$|The Garnaut Climate Change Review notes many {{barriers}} to increased global biosequestration. [...] "There must be {{changes in the}} accounting regimes for greenhouse gases. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions {{will need to be}} developed to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special <b>efforts</b> <b>will</b> be required to unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries." [...] Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global emissions trading scheme because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations. Collett likewise maintains that REDD credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their deforestation rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex market approach to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and will not be as effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests.|$|E
