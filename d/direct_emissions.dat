2500|$|Natural gas {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of methane. After release {{to the atmosphere}} it is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals (·OH) formed in the troposphere or stratosphere, giving the overall chemical reaction CH4 + 2O2→ CO2 + 2H2O. While the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide, with a half-life of about 7 years, it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere, so that a given quantity of methane has 84 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 28 times over a 100-year period. Natural gas is thus a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide due to the greater global-warming potential of methane. But because when it is burned, it produces more water than carbon dioxide by mole, in contrast to coal which produces mainly carbon dioxide, it produces {{only about half the}} carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour that coal does.

Because the K L → π + π − γ decay mode is massively dominated by the CP-violating inner bremsstrahlung (IB) and the CP-conserving magnetic dipole (M 1) <b>direct</b> <b>emission</b> processes, previous analyses have neglected the E 1 contribution. Therefore, this measurement is the first attempt to directly quantify the size of the E 1 decay process. This E 1 transition is {{one of the very few}} CP-violating processes that is accessible to experiment and, in principle, will produce new insights into the structure of the neutral kaon. The result of this analysis is that the E 1 contribution is below the threshold of sensitivity, and therefore an upper bound of | g E 1 | < 0. 14 (90 % CL) is reported. In the process of obtaining this upper limit, high resolution measurements of fit parameters (g˜ M 1 and a 1 a 2) associated with the size and shape of the M 1 <b>direct</b> <b>emission</b> peak are also extracted.

The most accurate annual CH 4 flux {{is achieved by}} gap filling EC fluxes with an empirical multivariate regression model, with soil temperature and mean wind velocity as driving variables. This model explains about 60 % of the variability in observed daily CH 4 fluxes. Annual N 2 O emissions can be separated into background emissions and event emissions due to fertilization. The background emission is estimated using a multivariate regression model also based on EC flux data, with soil temperature and mean wind velocity as driving variables. The event emissions are estimated using emission factors. The minimum <b>direct</b> <b>emission</b> factor is derived for six fertilization events by subtracting the background emission, and the IPCC default emission factor of 1 % {{is used for the}} other events.
