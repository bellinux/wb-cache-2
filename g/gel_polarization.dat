After harvesting, a 100 g. L − 1 solution of cells was first subjected to cell disruption by either high-pressure homogenization (HPH) or enzymatic treatment (ENZ). HPH resulted in a larger release of proteins (49 %) in the aqueous phase compared to the Alcalase incubation (35 %). In both cases, an ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) was then performed on the supernatant obtained from cell disruption by testing different membrane cut-off (1000 kDa, 500 kDa and 300 kDa).

40|$|Low {{frequency}} ultrasound {{has been}} used to facilitate cross-flow ultrafiltration of dairy whey solutions. Experimental results show that ultrasonic irradiation at low power levels can significantly enhance the permeate flux with an enhancement factor of between 1. 2 and 1. 7. The use of turbulence promoters (spacers) in combination with ultrasound can lead to a doubling in the permeate flux. The application of a combined pore blockage/cake resistance model to the observed experimental data suggests that the use of ultrasound acts to lower the compressibility of both the initial protein deposit and the growing cake. Conversely, the pore blockage parameter is not significantly affected. The use of a <b>gel</b> <b>polarization</b> model shows that the ultrasonic irradiation increases the mass transfer coefficient within the concentration polarization layer. Electron microscopy results showed no evidence that the ultrasonic irradiation altered the membrane integrity. HPLC analysis of the whey proteins in the feed solution before and after sonication showed that the concentration profile of the whey proteins was also not affected by the sonication process. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence <b>polarization,</b> <b>gel</b> {{exclusion}} chromatography and {{affinity chromatography}} {{were used to}} characterize the interaction of heparins of different size with human plasma fibronectin (Fn) and several of its isolated domains. The fluid-phase interaction of Fn with heparin was dominated by the 30 kDa and 40 kDa Hep- 2 domains located near the C-terminal ends of the A and B chains respectively. The 30 kDa Hep- 2 A domain from the heavy chain was indistinguishable from the 40 kDa Hep- 2 B domain in this respect; {{the presence of an}} additional type III homology unit in the latter had no effect on the binding. Evidence was provided that each Hep- 2 domain has two binding sites for heparin. The N-terminal Hep- 1 domain reacted weakly in fluid phase even though it binds strongly to immobilized heparin. Fn and Hep- 2 fragments were rather undiscriminating in their reaction with fluoresceinamine-labelled heparins of different sizes. However, oligosaccharides smaller than the tetradecasaccharide (14 -mer) bound Fn with a 5 - 10 -fold lower affinity. These results suggest that the Hep- 2 domains of Fn are able to recognize a broad spectrum of oligosaccharides that presumably vary significantly with respect to the amount and spatial distribution of charge...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of waste cutting oils by ultrafiltration was studied {{in a thin}} channel crossflow unit using regenerated cellulose membranes having molecular weight cutoffs (MWCOs) of 10 000 and 30 000. Experiments were carried out {{to determine the effects}} of emulsion concentration (1 - 5 % w/v), transmembrane pressure (0. 103 - 1. 241 MPa), and temperature (25 - 45 $ sp circ$C) on the permeation rate of clean water and on the oil content of the water, using a model cutting oil emulsion having a mean droplet size of 2. 8 um. The emulsion concentration had no effect on the permeate flux. Increasing temperature or pressure increased the flux. The {{concentration of}} oil in the permeate was directly proportional to the emulsion feed concentration, yielding rejections of oil greater than 0. 995. At feed concentrations above 5 % w/v, the membrane fouled. The permeate fluxes were approximately 1. 5 L/min m$ sp 2 $ for the 10 000 MWCO membrane, and 5. 0 /min L/min m 2 for the 30 000 MWCO membrane. A statistical model was developed relating ie permeate flux to the temperature and pressure. The fluxes were compared to a <b>gel</b> <b>polarization</b> model which was based on shear-driven diffusion. The experimental fluxes were somewhat higher than the predicted fluxes, with better agreement for the 50 000 MWCO membrane...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The definition, history and applications of Microfiltration (MP) are briefly reviewed in Chapter 1. The physical mechanisms and mathematical models of the filtration process including concentration polarization (CP), <b>gel</b> <b>polarization</b> (GP) and pore blocking are given in Chapter 2. Crossflow microfiltration membrane fouling and the deposition of solids onto the filter surface have been investigated using a process fluid (seawater), latex and a ground mineral. The performance of various membrane materials has also been studied, including: acrylonitrile, polypropylene, PTFE, ceramic and stainless steel. The seawater filtration work showed in Chapter 3 that good filtrate flux rates can be maintained if material fouling or depositing on the membrane can be prevented from entering the membrane structure. A surface deposit may be removed by mechanical means such as backflushing with permeate or compressed air. This aspect of the work indicated that a more comprehensive study of fouling was required. Existing crossflow filtration membrane models did not adequately represent even the simplest filtration when penetration of the membrane structure applied. Such conditions occurred during latex filtration in Chapter 4. Latex of varying sizes and density were manufactured and filtrations using acrylonitrile membranes were performed. Considerable deposition of latex inside the membrane pores occurred despite the nominal rating of the membrane being less than the latex particle diameter. Thus the membranes relied on a depth filtration mechanism rather than a surface straining mechanism for filtration effectiveness. A standard filtration blocking model was modified for use in crossflow microfiltration, coupled with a mass balance {{on the amount of}} material filtered. This mathematical model was then used to predict and correlate the rate of filtration flux decay with respect to filtration time during crossflow filtration. The model provided acceptable accuracy and is an improvement on existing empirical models for the flux decay period. Under the circumstances of membrane penetration it is advisable to minimise the amount of material entering the membrane structure. Mechanical means to achieve this were investigated and a novel anti-fouling method using a centrifugal field force and enhanced shear stress at the membrane surface was developed. The filtration of limestone slurries with three different tubular filters are presented in Chapter 5, in which one filter was conventional, the other two novel ones were specially designed for the separation of particles with a density {{different from that of the}} liquid, one used a helical channel around the filter, and the other had tangential inlet and outlet endcaps. The centrifugal force produced by the spinning flow around these two filters retarded the approach of particles towards the membrane surface so that the particle deposition was reduced. The results showed such a system was energy efficient, saving 20...|$|E
