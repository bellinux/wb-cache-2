5|$|The band {{existed for}} almost a decade before {{mainstream}} success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada, and continues to expand their success overseas, this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, entitled Billy Talent III, on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, entitled <b>Dead</b> <b>Silence,</b> on September 4, 2012. <b>Dead</b> <b>Silence</b> was followed up by a full UK tour over the course of October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled Hits on November 4, 2014. The band regrouped and began to prepare material for its fifth studio album. Just prior to entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk made the difficult decision to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and in early 2016 the group completed work on Afraid of Heights, which was released that July.|$|E
500|$|As {{he spoke}} his final sentence, {{he brought his}} hands to his head, fingers {{extended}} in imitation of thorns; amid <b>dead</b> <b>silence</b> in the Coliseum, he extended his arms, recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. [...] He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E
500|$|Saw II was {{immediately}} green-lit after Saws successful opening weekend a year earlier. Producers needed a script for a sequel [...] but James Wan and Leigh Whannell, director and writer of Saw, {{were working on}} Universal Pictures's <b>Dead</b> <b>Silence.</b> Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate, {{and was trying to}} sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to Saw. A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as {{they were looking for a}} cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong, who had worked on Saw, arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman. [...] Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce The Desperate. After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct.|$|E
50|$|Imboden would {{continually}} {{discover new}} ways to explore her subject matter. Her early images incorporate the moving water of streams or the unavoidable reflection of trees, graphic elements that further transform the figure in ways that heighten the psychological aspect of the work. Later, in images such as <b>Dead</b> <b>Silences</b> I & II, Imboden photographed above {{the surface of a}} black lined kiddie pool, which improved the visibility of the reflection as well as the magnification and refraction of the water. The images working with this method illustrate elongated forms, fluid and often tranquil due to the stillness of the water.|$|R

2500|$|The return {{fire from}} Blücher was ineffective, {{with the light}} {{artillery}} mostly pointing too high and the main batteries, 20.3cm guns, unable to fire due to {{the damage caused by}} the second 28cm round from Oscarsborg's Main Battery.

2500|$|On {{his third}} tour to Israel in 1953, Heifetz {{included}} in his recitals the Violin Sonata by Richard Strauss. At the time, Strauss {{and a number}} of other German intellectuals were considered by many to be Nazis, or at least Nazi sympathizers, and Strauss [...] works were unofficially banned in Israel along with those of Richard Wagner. Despite the fact that the Holocaust had occurred less than ten years earlier and a last-minute plea from the Israeli Minister of Education, the defiant Heifetz argued, [...] "The music is above these factors … I will not change my program. I have the right to decide on my repertoire." [...] Throughout his tour the performance of the Strauss sonata was followed by <b>dead</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Casting for {{the lead}} {{characters}} of NBC police procedural television drama series [...] occurred {{in the spring of}} 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Detective Olivia Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male role – Detective Elliot Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together and after the actors left, {{there was a moment of}} <b>dead</b> <b>silence,</b> after which Wolf blurted out, [...] "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni." [...] The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.|$|E
2500|$|Former French {{president}} Valéry Giscard d'Estaing {{claimed that}} Bongo helped bankroll Jacques Chirac's 1981 presidential campaign. Giscard said Bongo {{had developed a}} [...] "very questionable financial network" [...] over time. [...] "I called Bongo and told him 'you're supporting my rival's campaign' {{and there was a}} <b>dead</b> <b>silence</b> that I still remember to this day and then he said 'Ah, you know about it', which was extraordinary. From that moment on, I broke off personal relations with him", said Giscard. Socialist French parliamentarian André Vallini reportedly claimed that Bongo had bankrolled numerous French electoral campaigns, both Right and Left. In 2008, French President, Nicolas Sarkozy demoted his minister in charge of looking after the ex-colonies, Jean-Marie Bockel, after the latter noted the [...] "squandering of public funds" [...] by some African regimes, provoking Mr. Bongo's fury.He made his country and his oil industry available as a source of offshore slush funds", said political analyst Nicholas Shaxson, {{the author of a book}} on Africa's oil states. [...] "These were used by all the French political parties — from the left to the right — for secret party financing, and as a source of bribes in support of French commercial bids all over the world.|$|E
60|$|In <b>dead</b> <b>silence</b> on her side, {{she rose}} from her chair. In <b>dead</b> <b>silence</b> she stood erect on the hearth-rug, and faced her husband in widow's weeds.|$|E

60|$|Now {{no voice}} was lifted up; {{they stared at}} her, and, smiling a little, she {{answered}} them with her calm eyes till their heads sank beneath her gaze.

6000|$|Our way of {{scattering}} applause along {{through an}} act {{seems to me}} to be better than the Mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended. I do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion before a cold still audience. I should think he would feel foolish. It is a pain to me to this day, to remember how that old German Lear raged and wept and howled around the stage, with never a response from that hushed house, never a single outburst till the act was ended. To me there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn <b>dead</b> <b>silences</b> that always followed this old person's tremendous outpourings of his feelings. I could not help putting myself in his place--I thought I knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences, because I remembered a case which came under my observation once, and which--but I will tell the incident: ...|$|R

60|$|The {{gates of}} the glorious {{structure}} were barred; the walls were crowded with their Pagan defenders.

Those among the besiegers who were nearest the temple saw in this presiding genius of the preparations for defence the object at once of their most malignant hatred and their most ungovernable dread--Ulpius the priest.|$|R
