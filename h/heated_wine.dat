40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of organic residues present in ancient pottery can give important information for archaeologists. Diets, habits, technologies and original {{use of the}} vessels can be identified through this studies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were used in order to analyse organic resinous materials from the interior surfaces of Roman amphorae belonging to the archaeological collection of DRASSM and Museum of Arles Antique. In addition, wine amphorae from Grand Congloué 2 shipwreck were analysed. The FTIR spectra obtained by the technique of KBr micropellets, prepared directly with the materials scraped from the amphora without any further sample preparation, provided enough information to establish their diterpenoic nature. GC–MS enabled to identify dehydroabietic acid, 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid, 7 -hydroxy-dehydroabietic acid, 15 -hydroxy- 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid, methyl dehydroabietate, retene. The presence of diterpenoids and retene provided evidence that the amphorae examined were waterproofed with a pitch produced from resinous wood of plants from the Pinaceae family or mainly consist of Coniferae species. Moreover presence of retene in samples indicates that pitch was <b>heated.</b> <b>Wine</b> and fish amphorae were studied. Some fish amphorae samples did not show the presence of pitch in GC-MS analyses. This work studies {{for the first time}} pitch of an fish amphorae in the laboratory of IMBE...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Heat</b> damaged <b>wines</b> {{are often}} casually {{referred}} to as cooked, which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. [...] The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13°C (55°F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible {{along the length of}} the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. <b>Heat</b> damaged <b>wines</b> often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.|$|R

Bentonite (Volclay KWK, American Colloid Co.), 4. 6 g suspended in 200 mL water, was added to 19 L of juice prior to fermentation. The control had 200 mL water added only. Juice treated with bentonite before fermentation required the lowest amounts of postfermentation bentonite to achieve protein stability, as determined by heat stability tests using a nephelometer. A correlation was observed between the turbidity of heated juices treated with different amounts of bentonite and protein measured by the Bradford Protein method. Sensory studies were conducted to ascertain if the effect of different bentonite additions and timing of additions changed the sensory perception of the resulting wine...|$|R
