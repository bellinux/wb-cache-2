40|$|The paper {{applies to}} the issue of {{preservation}} of passenger vehicles during overcoming the roadblocks on a dry asphalt surface with the constant speed. The study aimed to estimate the forces which are affecting the suspension of the vehicle during the contact between a tyre and roadblock. Using the video recording it is possible to calculate the values <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> <b>deflection</b> and forces acting in the system. The obtained <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> were compared to earlier laboratory test results and load-deflection characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> with the same size. The roadblock with the defined geometry causes a dynamic <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tyre.</b> During the study a significant change in the geometry of the suspension has not occurred. The paper presents the characteristics of the vehicles research with a particular regard to model and type <b>of</b> <b>tyres.</b> The determination <b>of</b> the exact dimensions of the roadblocks and application of the ADIS 16385 system for acquisition and archiving the features of the kinematic motion of the vehicle allowed to determine the speed at the moment of collision with the roadblock...|$|R
40|$|Future {{active safety}} systems for {{vehicles}} will need accurate information about the state <b>of</b> the vehicle. <b>Tyre</b> sensors certainly offer an interesting option to evaluate the operating state <b>of</b> an individual <b>tyre.</b> On the other hand, tyre behaviour in some driving conditions is not completely understood and tyre sensor measurements {{can contribute to the}} fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> research as well. This thesis discusses a method to measure the carcass <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> a rolling <b>tyre.</b> Tyre force estimation algorithms are proposed and tested in real time with a low-cost micro-controller unit. The tyre force information is then exploited to estimate the lateral state of a car. In addition, the tyre sensor signals in aquaplaning are carefully studied and the hydrodynamic and viscous aquaplaning zones were separated from the data in post-processing. Another method was developed to estimate partial and full aquaplaning in real time. The results obtained support the development <b>of</b> more production-friendly <b>tyre</b> sensor concepts. The relations between carcass deflections and tyre forces that were obtained can be useful for completely different types of sensors. In addition, tyre behaviour in complex conditions can be measured and the results can validate tyre models...|$|R

The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios. Out of the four types of samples tested, three (with mixing ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75 and 35 / 65 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds to sand) are prepared using 50 to 100 mm long tyre shreds and one (25 / 75 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chips to sand) using tyre chips with nominal size of 9. 5 mm.

40|$|Abstract: The {{ultimate}} {{bearing capacity}} test is carried on CFST arch bridge model with CFRP slings, and the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> tie-beams, CFST arch, crossbeams, decks is also tested. Studies have shown that before the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling, the <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> east and west tie-beam, east and west arch both has good symmetry. The <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> crossbeams and decks also has good symmetry, but after the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling(located at the middle of west tie-beam), the structural internal forces redistribution appeared. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam increased suddenly, and the mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam is larger than that of east tie-beam by 14. 6 %. The mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> east arch is larger than that of west arch by 9. 9 %. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> crossbeam at 3 L/ 8 and L/ 4 sections are respectively larger than those of crossbeam at 5 L/ 8 and 3 L/ 4 sections by 13. 8 % and 5. 3 %, The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> 3 #, 2 # and 1 # decks are respectively larger than those of 4 #, 5 # and 6 # decks by 7. 8 %, 13. 2 % and 17. 1 %.
