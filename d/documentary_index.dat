40|$|In this book, Ronald Day {{offers a}} {{critical}} {{history of the}} modern tradition of documentation. Focusing on the <b>documentary</b> <b>index</b> (understood {{as a mode of}} social positioning), and drawing on the work of the French documentalist Suzanne Briet, Day explores the understanding and uses of indexicality. He examines the transition as indexes went from being explicit professional structures that mediated users and documents to being implicit infrastructural devices used in everyday information and communication acts. Doing so, he also traces three epistemic eras in the representation of individuals and groups, first in the forms of documents, then information, then data. Day investigates five cases from the modern tradition of documentation. He considers the socio-technical instrumentalism of Paul Otlet, "the father of European documentation" (contrasting it to the hermeneutic perspective of Martin Heidegger); the shift from documentation to information science and the accompanying transformation of persons and texts into users and information; social media's use of algorithms, further subsuming persons and texts; attempts to build android robots [...] to embody human agency within an information system that resembles a human being; and social "big data" as a technique of neoliberal governance that employs indexing and analytics for purposes of surveillance. Finally, Day considers the status of critique and judgment at a time when people and their rights of judgment are increasingly mediated, displaced, and replaced by modern documentary techniques. A critical history of the modern tradition of documentation, tracing the representation of individuals and groups in the form of documents, information, and data...|$|E

40|$|To documentalists fits {{to develop}} and use <b>documentary</b> {{languages}} for <b>indexing</b> and information recovery, to guarantee terminological unit in the bibliographical processing products. We should look for in Terminology, the conceptual and theorical basis in documentary languages construction of specialized areas of the human knowledge, considering that Documentation has not theoretical basis to construct specialized lexicons. The documentalist who wants to develop documentary languages has to unite Terminology and Documentation. The Terminology will supply the methodology for search and use of terms and the Documentation the conceptual basis for the documentary language structuring...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe wide {{adoption}} {{of social and}} connected tools in organizations lead them to think again about their behavior and to consider the indexing of the resources users can now produce with such tools, {{in the same way}} they <b>index</b> other <b>documentary</b> resources. This <b>indexing</b> process has to be done along the core frame of reference of the organization. We present in this paper the model of a system which permit the indexing {{with the help of an}} ontology of both documentary resources or those produced on a social platform resources...|$|R
40|$|In South America (SA) several {{documentary}} based climate {{time series}} exist, {{some of them}} extending back to the 16 th century. Most of these records end in the 19 th century, {{and can not be}} calibrated against instrumental data. Here, we used the newspaper "Los Andes" from Mendoza, Argentina, to extend <b>documentary</b> based <b>indices</b> of Mendoza precipitation and Central Andes snow depth to the late 20 th century. A statistical approach to create "pseudo documentary" 20 th century data was applied to prolong eight other documentary records. Increased variability of the hydrological cycle in the Central Andes and prevailing periods of wet and dry years in Mendoza suggest that the 20 th century is extraordinary {{in the context of the}} last 400 years. The final set of extended documentaries explains significant portions of SA precipitation variability in large areas between 20 °S and 40 °S and can therefore improve the network of annually resolved precipitation proxies...|$|R
40|$|The indexer is {{considered}} individually, in a cognitive approach, {{as a professional}} reader. Due to the information processing he carries out during the documentary reading for the subject analysis, the indexer {{must be considered in}} his social-cultural context that comprehends professional performance in social-cognitive approach. Consequently, it is proposed a theoretical analysis on the socio-cognitive and cognitive approaches in Information Science in order to establish the searching on the use of teaching strategies of documentary reading for the indexer's initial education. The research on <b>documentary</b> reading for <b>indexing,</b> at first developed with cognitive approach observing the indexer's task is of great importance to the knowledge of reading and professional reading. Nevertheless, approaching the interactive model of reading carried out by the interaction among the three variables, text-reader-context, it is circumscribed a social-cognitive approach necessary to the indexer, as a reader, in order to enlarge his vision of socio-cultural context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the behavior of the ten largest Brazilian banks between June 2008 and September 2009, based on the analysis of financial indicators. Therefore, 16 three-monthly indices were calculated, extracted from financial statement information, which characterizes a <b>documentary</b> research. The <b>indices</b> were separated in five categories: liquidity, capital, profitability, income and market. The obtained results appointed that most financial institutions in the sample were able to manage their resources so as to gain conditions to maintain credit initially. Then, as from the first term of 2009, driven by public banks, they increased their credit operations. In addition, most banks revealed an anti-cyclical trend to encourage productive activities, preferably activities with higher liquidity levels, to the detriment of profitability, which reveals a more conservative attitude. Finally, it was verified that government initiatives, the Brazilian economic balance and the resources the banks offered helped to produce an environment to reactivate business activities during the most acute period of the subprime crisis...|$|R
