25|$|Following the 2010–11 Tunisian Revolution, a Constituent Assembly {{worked for}} 2.5 years to {{written a new}} Constitution, {{approved}} in January 2014, contained a provision in Article 6 granting freedom of conscience. It also stipulates that 'ccusations of apostasy and <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> are prohibited'. With it, Tunisia became the first Arab-majority country to protect its citizens from prosecution for renouncing Islam. Critics have pointed out alleged flaws of this formulation, namely that it violates the freedom of expression.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, {{the court}} convicted Morsi, along with 12 other defendants, {{including}} former MP Mohamed Beltagy, for the arrest and torture of protesters and <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence.</b> All defendants were acquitted of murder charges. The judge handed down a 20-year sentence for Morsi {{and the others}} who were convicted. Morsi still faced separate trials for espionage, terrorism, and prison break charges {{and was sentenced to}} death on 16 May along with other defendants. The death penalty was handed down to Morsi and 105 others for their role in the Wadi el-Natrun prison break of January 2011. As per Egypt's penal code, the opinion was referred to the Grand Mufti, whose assent or dissent is legally nonbinding.|$|E

For his stance, he was against Salafism (Wahhabism) extremist ideology culminating from Saudi Arabia itself.|$|E
40|$|Freedom {{of speech}} is a {{fundamental}} liberty that imposes a stringent duty of tolerance. Tolerance is limited by direct <b>incitements</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence.</b> False notions and bad laws on speech have obscured our view of this freedom.

Those who disagree {{have the right to}} argue back but their attempts to shut us up are morally wrong...|$|R
5000|$|Proving the {{incitement}} {{is difficult}} given the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution standards that govern words in any medium. At {{the time the}} Internet was much less popular, so the point rested on the court's viewing the Internet as such a different media as to warrant a different legal standard.

2500|$|In early October, a {{military}} propaganda campaign began {{to sweep the}} country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences {{that it was a}} Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes. 30 September Movement was called Gestapu (from Gerakan September Tigapuluh, [...] "30 September Movement"). The Army, acting on orders by Suharto and supervised by Nasution, began a campaign of agitation and <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> among Indonesian civilians aimed at the Communist community and toward President Sukarno himself. The PKI's denials of involvement had little effect. The regime was quickly destabilised, with the Army the only force left to maintain order.|$|E

He also organised protests outside the concerts of singers whose lyrics he says incite violence, mainly Jamaican dancehall and ragga artists who he says glorify violence toward lesbians and gay men, including murder. Tatchell's campaign began in the early 1990s when Buju Banton's song [...] "Boom bye-bye" [...] was released.

[...] The Conservative MP David Davis criticised Morrissey's comments, saying that [...] "any <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> is obviously wrong in a civilised society and should be investigated by the police".

Wilson also established the first western propaganda office, the United States Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel, the [...] "Creel Commission", which circulated patriotic anti-German appeals and conducted censorship of materials considered seditious. To further counter disloyalty {{to the war effort}} at home, Wilson pushed through Congress the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 to suppress anti-British, pro-German, or anti-war statements. While he welcomed socialists who supported the war, he pushed {{at the same time to}} arrest and deport foreign-born enemies. Many recent immigrants, resident aliens without U.S. citizenship, who opposed America's participation in the war were deported to Soviet Russia or other nations under the powers granted in the Immigration Act of 1918.|$|E

In response, al-Sadr launched a day of protests. During these protests, members of the Iraqi insurgency (who {{may or may not}} have been tied to al-Sadr) ambushed a Coalition patrol guarding a trash collecting unit in Sadr-City resulting in the deaths of 8 soldiers.

If you used the word 'Palestinian' in any public place when I first arrived in New York in the early 1970s you risked being punched in the face." [...] When it came to 'political correctness' in the early 1990s Cockburn was critical, though he often stressed that the term had its origins as an in-joke on the Left in the 70s. He {{went as far as}} taking a critical stance on hate speech legislation and wrote in 2009 [...] "America is {{well on its way to}} making it illegal to say anything nasty about gays, Jews, blacks and women. “Hate speech,” far short of any direct <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence,</b> is on the edge of being criminalized, with the First Amendment gone the way of the dodo." ...|$|E

[...] which {{are not in the}} original version of the poem. Erdoğan said the poem had been approved by the education ministry to be published in textbooks. Under article 312/2 of the Turkish penal code his recitation was regarded as an <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> and religious or racial hatred. He was given a ten-month prison sentence of which he served four months, from 24 March 1999 to 27 July 1999. [...] Due to his conviction, Erdoğan was forced to give up his mayoral position. The conviction also stipulated a political ban, which prevented him from participating in parliamentary elections. He had appealed for the sentence to be converted to a monetary fine, but it was reduced to 120 days instead. In 2017, this period of Erdoğan's life was made into a film titled Reis.|$|E

6000|$|Having {{regard to}} that part of the {{question}} which concerns the issue between the two Houses, we repudiate emphatically the claim of the other House to what the French call faire l'ange--to [...] "play the angel," [...] to know better than the people themselves what the people want, to have a greater authority to speak {{in the name of the}} people than their representatives sent to Parliament by the elaborate process I have described. To dispute the authority of a newly elected Parliament is something very like an <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> on the part of the other House. The noble Lord[6] laughs; but we are anxious to convince him and his friends that we are in earnest. We go through all the processes which the Constitution prescribes, we produce an enormous majority, and we express the opinion of that majority, but still the noble Lord and other noble Lords, less intelligent, but more remote, tell us that they are not convinced. What steps do they suggest that we should take in order to bring home to them the earnestness of our plea? What steps do they suggest that the people should take in order to assert their wishes? I hold entirely by what I said that to dispute the authority of an elected body fresh from its constituents is a deliberate incitement to the adoption of lawless and unconstitutional methods. The assertion which the House of Lords made at the end of last year is an intolerable assertion. I believe the country is altogether unprepared for it; and I wonder it was thought worth while to risk an institution which has lasted so many centuries, in the very skirmish line of Party warfare.|$|E
