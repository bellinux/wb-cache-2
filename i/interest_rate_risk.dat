25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk,</b> meaning that their market prices will {{decrease}} in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E

40|$|Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Australia {{experienced}} tremendous {{growth and}} investor interest following {{the crash of}} unlisted property funds in the 1990 s. Since 2001, management structures have shifted from external property management to an internally advised model. The sector’s returns had been notably rewarding up till the Global Financial Crisis but rising costs of debt and years of aggressive borrowing to fund expansions have eroded the values of REITs. Externally managed trusts had relatively higher levels of debt than their internally managed counterparts thus increasing the sensitivities to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks.</b> Yet internally managed REITs engage in a wider set of operating activities which compound exposures to market and financial risks. Using panel regressions, this paper aims to examine the joint impact of financial leverage and management structure on REIT returns {{in terms of their}} sensitivities towards stock market returns and changes to yields of 10 -year bonds and 90 -day bank accepted bills. We utilise a sample period of monthly data from January 1980 to March 2013. Panel quantile regressions are also employed to analyse how sensitivities to market risks, short and long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks</b> vary at different parts of an economic cycle. Our study finds that REITs are positively related to the stock market and the effect is greater for REITs with greater financial leverage as well as stapled trusts. REITs are only negatively affected by short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> at the lowest 5 per cent quantile of returns. Long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have an inverse effect on REITs only at the upper 75 and 95 per cent quantiles. We consider the possibilities that rental yields and inflationary expectations may offset the influences of financing costs. Internal management appears to compound market and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks.</b> These have implications on investors looking to select REITs as substitutes of direct property investments...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates US Treasury market {{volatility}} and develops {{new ways of}} dealing with the underlying <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility <b>risk.</b> We adopt an innovative approach which is based on a class of model-free <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility (VXI) indices we derive from options traded on the CBOE. The empirical analysis indicates substantial <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility <b>risk</b> for medium-term instruments which declines to the levels of the equity market only as the tenor increases to 30 years. We show that this risk appears to be priced in the market and has a significant time-varying relationship with equity volatility risk. US Treasury {{market volatility}} is appealing from an investment diversification perspective since the VXI indices are negatively correlated with the levels of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and of equity market implied volatility indices, respectively. Although VXI indices are affected by macroeconomic and monetary news, they are only partially spanned by information contained in the yield curve. Motivated by our results on the magnitude and the nature of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility <b>risk</b> and by the phenomenal recent growth of the equity volatility derivative market, we propose the use of our VXI indices as benchmarks for monitoring, securitizing, managing and trading <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility <b>risk.</b> As a first step in this direction, we describe a framework of one-factor equilibrium models for pricing VXI futures and options on the basis of empirically favored mean-reverting jump-diffusions...|$|R
