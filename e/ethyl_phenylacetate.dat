This indirect method {{is often used}} because aryl halides are relatively weaker nucleophiles than aliphatic halocarbons and thus poorly alkylate diethyl malonate. Methods using Caesium carbonate and copper(I) iodide {{have been developed to}} overcome this difficulty however.|$|E

At the moment, {{the production of}} natural <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> is very limited. However, the biotransformation production of natural <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> has an very extensive application prospect. This paper is written by taking the phenylacetic acid tolerance and the esterifying enzyme activity as the two indexes for screening the HA 14 strain of hansenula anomala mutagenic which {{is regarded as the}} microorganism of <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> production through biotransformation. By optimizing the production condition of phenylacetic acid and the esterification condition of <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> the production of <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> accomplished through biotransformation within 72 hours can reach 864 mg/L which is 171 % of that of the initial bacterial strain...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{involving the}} Claisen condensation reaction for a first-year organic chemistry laboratory is presented. Claisen condensations are routinely covered in organic textbooks but {{owing to the}} long reaction times required to reach equilibrium in solution they are seldom explored in the undergraduate teaching laboratory. In this experiment, potassium tert-butoxide and <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> are heated to 100 °C for 30 minutes under solvent-free conditions to produce 2, 4 -diphenyl acetoacetate in 80 % yield. The solvent-free nature of this procedure greatly reduces the quantity of waste generated by students relative to typical carbonyl condensation experiments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical flow-through method to separate anisole and <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> respectively, from a polystyrene mixture. The microfluidic separation uses different diffusive {{dynamics of the}} substances transverse to the lamination flow formed in a microchannel. The effect of inlet flow rates and ambient temperature on separation is examined. Additionally, {{the possibility of the}} separation of the light substance from the mixture with different molecular weight is shown numerically and experimentally. The separation efficiency is explained by the facts that the relaxation time depends on the inlet flow rate and that the diffusivity depends on the ambient temperature. This method can be applied to separate monomers from aggregates...|$|E

40|$|The aroma compositions, sensory attributes, {{and their}} {{correlations}} of various traditional Chinese sweet fermented flour pastes (SFFPs) were investigated. SFFPs, including LEEJ, LEEH, and XH 6, showed high overall acceptance scores of 8. 00, 8. 21, and 7. 50, respectively. Ninety-six volatile compounds were detected using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped SFFPs into three clusters {{according to their}} concentrations and compositions of volatile components. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that volatile compounds, including <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> 5 -methyl furfural, amyl cinnamal, ethyl myristate, decyl aldehyde, 1 -phenylethyl acetate, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 3 -buten- 2 -ol, butanoic acid, and caproaldehyde, were highly negatively correlated with saltiness, sourness, and bitterness, while they were positively correlated with sweetness, umami, richness, and acceptance. The obvious correlation between flavor profiles and sensory attributes could help online monitoring of SFFPs’ flavor quality during production...|$|E
40|$|A silver-olefin based {{coordination}} polymer {{was prepared}} in a simple, one step process {{to act as}} an initiator to facilitate the ring-opening polymerization of epoxides. Thermal analysis found the complex to be capable of curing a range of commercially available epoxy resins used in the manufacture of conventional composite materials. Curing of the oligomeric diglycidyl ether bisphenol A resin, Epon 828, in combination with a non-toxic solvent, <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The mechanical characterization of the resultant cured polymers was conducted by single lap shear tests. Tapered double cantilever beam (TDCB) test specimens containing 2. 5 pph of silver-olefin initiator, both with and without embedded microcapsules, were analyzed for their healing performance. Healing efficiency values were found to be strongly dependent on the applied healing temperature. A mean recovery of 74 % fracture load was found in TDCB samples after being healed at 70 °C for 48 h...|$|E
40|$|Aglianico del Vulture {{wines are}} typical and {{promising}} production of Basilicata Province. Nevertheless, its potential quality is often {{affected by the}} presence of a strong honey-like odour. This problem was studied using SPME-GC-MS and SPMEGC- O; <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> (EPhA), was identified as the main responsible of this olfactory character. This volatile compound is detectable in all wines, but it is particularly abundant in Aglianico wines; its sensory threshold was determined. Moreover, in order to study the relationship between EPhA concentration and wine sensory perception, another sensory test was performed on Aglianico wines affected by different levels of defect: an Attribute Difference Test. EPhA concentrations higher than the detected sensory threshold (about 70 ?g L- 1) gave to the wines a strong honey-like character, that seemed to compromise its pleasantness. Further deepening are necessary to study the main variables connected to the formation of this compound in Aglianico, and to suggest possible technological approaches to reduce the problem...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{high-quality}} and peculiar {{products is}} a recent trend in the enological field; for this reason, production of wines from autochthonous vine varieties is requested by consumers. Aglianico wine from the Italian region "Basilicata" {{is an example of}} a promising product strictly connected to the territory; nevertheless, it is affected by a frequent sweet-like off-flavor. In this study the compositional cause of this off-flavor was investigated by SPME-GC-olfactometry, SPME-GC-MS, and sensory tests. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> (EPhA) was found to be the compound mainly responsible, and its sensory threshold was determined near 73 μg/L; products with the odorant concentration near and up to these values were always recognized as significantly different from the other wines and were often far from wine technical pleasantness; besides EPhA gave to the wines a strong honey-like character. Some preliminary hypotheses about its mechanism of formation (shikimate pathway) are presented in this study: these hypotheses could explain the correlation between EPhA and volatile phenols that was found by both sensory tests and GC quantitative analysis of wines affected by different levels of defect. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{grape berry}} {{microbiota}} is deeply {{influenced by the}} sanitary status of grapes. In sound grapes the most frequent yeast species were basidiomycetes, Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida zemplinina and Hanseniaspora uvarum. Sour rotten grapes were mostly colonised by C. zemplinina, H. uvarum, Issatchenkia spp. and Zygoascus hellenicus. The presence of minoritary populations of Zygosaccharomyces bailii was only found in damaged grapes. The acetic acid bacteria Gluconobacter spp. and Gluconoacetobacter spp. were isolated from healthy and injured grapes, while Acetobacter spp. was only associated with sour rot. Sour rot induced an increase of the sugar content, volatile acidity, colour and total phenols of grape juices. Wines with sour rot up to 30 % showed equal overall quality after one year of bottle storage. However, wines made with sour rotten grapes showed a distinctive chemical and honey-like aroma. Phenylacetic acid and <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> both exhibiting honey-sweet like aromas, emerged as key-aroma compounds of sour rotten wines. The causal agents of sour rot were acetic acid bacteria disseminated by the insect Drosophila spp [...] In the absence of these flies, putative plant defense mechanisms, probably mediated by the accumulation of phenylacetic acid, led to skin healing, preventing sour rot spreadin...|$|E
40|$|High performance, damage {{tolerant}} fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials are currently required to demonstrate no propagation of any sub-surface structural micro-cracking when under service load, thereby encouraging overdesign and limiting the inherent lightweight nature {{of such a}} material. By incorporating selfhealing functionalities, in-situ autonomous repair can be initiated {{in the event of}} damage to maintain structural integrity while ultimately realising lighter and more sustainable structures. We have demonstrated metal triflate initiated ring opening polymerisation (ROP) of epoxide resin [1] in FRPs to restore > 99 % of the host matrix fracture toughness after damage under Mode I tests. Optimising the polymer composition via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) identified the key parameters to achieve autonomous curing under ambient conditions. Initial and self-healed performance was evaluated using FRP E-glass double cantilever beam (DCB) coupon mechanical test specimens with embedded microvascular channels for self-healing agent delivery. Full recovery of fracture toughness (> 99 %) was demonstrated while achieving the following requirements: low cost, low toxicity, autonomous curing, autonomous delivery, usability, manufacturing processability and applicability to existing aerospace and automotive maintenance programs. Brittle and ductile cohesive failure mechanisms resulted from inclusion of a solvent (<b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate)</b> within the healing agent under low (10 wt%) and medium (25 wt%) concentrations. Therefore, the failure mechanism can be adapted as the solvent acts as a plasticiser in the self-healing agent. This was further confirmed by imaging fracture plane surfaces via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adhesive repair was typically ~ 100 ?m in thickness, comparable to damage voids present in impact damaged FRP composite materials...|$|E
40|$|Microbial starter {{cultures}} have extensively {{been used to}} enhance the consistency and efficiency of industrial fermentations. Despite the advantages of such controlled fermentations, the fermentation involved {{in the production of}} chocolate is still a spontaneous process that relies on the natural microbiota at cocoa farms. However, recent studies indicate that certain thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures can be used as starter cultures for cocoa pulp fermentation. In this study, we investigate the potential of specifically developed starter cultures to modulate chocolate aroma. Specifically, we developed several new S. cerevisiae hybrids that combine thermotolerance and efficient cocoa pulp fermentation with a high production of volatile flavor-active esters. In addition, we investigated the potential of two strains of two non-Saccharomyces species that produce very large amounts of fruity esters (Pichia kluyveri and Cyberlindnera fabianii) to modulate chocolate aroma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed an increased concentration of various flavor-active esters and a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in batches inoculated with S. cerevisiae starter cultures and, to a lesser extent, in batches inoculated with P. kluyveri and Cyb. fabianii. Additionally, GC-MS analysis of chocolate samples revealed that while most short-chain esters evaporated during conching, longer and more-fat-soluble ethyl and acetate esters, such as ethyl octanoate, phenylethyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> ethyl decanoate, and ethyl dodecanoate, remained almost unaffected. Sensory analysis by an expert panel confirmed significant differences in the aromas of chocolates produced with different starter cultures. Together, these results show that the selection of different yeast cultures opens novel avenues for modulating chocolate flavor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aroma {{fraction}} of Italian distillates of wild (Pyrus amygidaliformis, Vill., namely ‘Pirastru’) and cultivated (Pyrus communis, L. cvs. ‘Coscia’, ‘Precoce di Fiorano’ and ‘Butirru de Austu’) pear varieties {{grown in the}} northern part of the island of Sardinia was investigated. Distillates from fermented mashes were obtained from the same producer and, in most cases, for 3 years following the same production process. Aroma analyses were performed by GC-FID and GC-MS techniques with direct GC injection of full proof distillates. Differences were found in the aromatic profile of all the distillates depending on their varietal origin. Wild Pirastru pear distillates were the richest in isoeugenol (0. 186 g hL - 1 a. a.), ethyl benzoate (0. 388 g hL - 1 a. a.) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> (0. 12 g hL - 1 a. a.) but the poorest in 1 -hexanol (2. 69 g hL - 1 a. a.), n-hexyl acetate (0. 07 g hL - 1 a. a.), ∑-farnesene isomers (0. 80 g hL - 1 a. a.) and citronellol (0. 007 g hL - 1 a. a.). Pirastru distillates were also the poorest in methyl and ethyl unsaturated decanoate isomers, the socalled Williams pear esters (0. 002 g hL - 1 a. a.). On the contrary, these compounds that characterise the aroma of Williams pear distillates were abundant in Coscia spirits (1. 032 g hL - 1 a. a.). The latter, together with Precoce di Fiorano, were rich in farnesene isomers (6. 48 and 9. 26 g hL - 1 a. a. respectively). Evaluation of the data by univariate (ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis) and multivariate (PCA and HCA) statistical analyses revealed that some components (the classes of acetates, farnesene isomers, methyl and ethyl unsaturated decanoate esters and citronellol) are relevant in discriminating the distillates according to variety...|$|E
40|$|In {{applying}} the Hammet equation the naphthyl derivatives, the fused benzene ring may {{be regarded as}} a group attached to a corresponding phenyl derivative, and its influence on reactivity may be discussed in terms of the Hammet substituent constant δ. Such discussion, {{in the case of a}} 1 -naphthyl derivative is severely limited because the electronic effect (which is measured by δ) is masked by steric effects, the magnitude of which cannot normally be determined. Simple reactions of 2 -naphthyl derivatives are free from such steric complication. The Analysis of date already published has revealed that, although the 3 : 4 -benzo substituent has almost invariably been assigned a single δ value, there is apparently marked variation in the δ values required for different reactions. In the present investigation three reactions have been studied. The reactions were so chosen that (a) any past studies aided the interpretation of the present results and (b) the required δ values covered the range indicated by the analysis of data available in the literature. The reactions studied were as follows: (1) 	The reaction of benzoyl chloride with 1 - and 2 -naphthylanine in benzene was studied at 10 °, 25 °, 35 °and 45 °. (2) 	The solvolysis in ethanol of phenyl- 1 -naphthylcarbinyl chloride and of phenyl- 2 -naphthylcarbinyl chloride was examined at four temperatures over the range 5 °- 25 °. For this reaction other data available were insufficient to obtain an accurate value of the reaction constant ρ, which is required for the calculation of a δ₃:₄-benzo value. Consequently the reaction kinetics of phenyl-m-bromophenyl-, phenyl-m-chlorophenyl-, phenyl-m-methylphenyl, phenyl-m-nitrophenyl- and diphenylcarbinyl chloride, were also examined in this reaction. These compounds were studied over the range 25 °- 75 °. (3) 	The kinetics of the hydrolysis of ethyl 1 -naphthyl-ethyl 2 -naphthyl- and <b>ethyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> were investigated at four temperatures over the range of 20 °- 50 °. It was clear from the present results, taken in conjunction with other data, that the δ values required for the 3 : 4 -benzo substituent fall into significantly different classes. The difference may be linked ti the type and extent of conjugation possible between the substituent and the functional group in the reactant and transition states of these reactions. The reality of the differences in δ values, and the explanation for such differences, are discussed. For the reactions of 1 -naphthyl derivatives studies in the present work, discussion of the 2 : 3 -benzo substituent in terms of δ values is not meaningful without the accurate assessment of steric effects...|$|E
