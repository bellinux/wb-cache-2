40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters observed during extruded fibre fabrication is its diameter. The diameter can be measured with a single scanning camera assuming that the fibre section has a circular shape. As proved in practice, another important parameter is ovality, that is the rate of fibre flattening. This paper assumes that the fibre section shape is elliptical. In such a case, at least three different views on examined fibre are needed. This paper deals with analytical description <b>of</b> fibre <b>ovality</b> measurement using two different approaches based {{on the principles of}} linear algebra and projective geometry.

40|$|Abstract: Deformation {{of round}} {{castings}} due to thermal and/or mechanical strain {{may lead to}} the occurrence <b>of</b> their <b>ovality</b> <b>defects</b> during continuous casting. Presently, ovality defect from thermal deformation have been effectively controlled in actual casting process with the application of more advanced equipments and more sophisticated control strategies. But the control <b>of</b> <b>ovality</b> <b>defect</b> from larger mechanical deformation still cannot satisfy the need of caster design or higher qualified rate of castings. It is shown that excessive hot pressure while strand passes through tension leveler, is the main reason to generate larger mechanical deformation. With consideration of the characteristics of round caster and the requirement of safety production, a theoretical calculated model based on mechanical deformation analysis has been developed in the paper to eliminate ovality defect specially from the over large hot pressure. Calculation analysis suggests that groove design of drive roller and range of round section sizes should be the important consideration for the determination of hot pressure, and there always exists an optimum value for hot pressure when the machine equipments of round caster have been designed and installed. The model can provide a useful guideline for casting engineers to design the groove of drive roller and to determine reasonable safe hot pressure. Reliability of the model analysis has been verified by industrial application on a newly built round caster...|$|R

In its classic form, the phenotype is identical to that of GH deficiency, and was originally described in association with <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> the GH receptor. With increasing understanding of the GH–insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, it has become apparent that GH resistance can result from either primary IGF deficiency (IGFD) or IGF resistance.

40|$|The present paper {{makes an}} attempt to depict the effect <b>of</b> <b>ovality</b> in the inlet pigtail pipe bend of a {{reformer}} under combined internal pressure and in-plane bending. Finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments have been used. An incoloy Ni-Fe-Cr B 407 alloy material was considered for study and assumed to be elastic-perfectly plastic in behavior. The design of pipe bend is based on ASME B 31. 3 standard and during manufacturing process, {{it is challenging to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius and thinning on the outer radius of pipe bend. This geometrical shape imperfection is known as ovality and its effect needs investigation which is considered for the study. The finite element analysis (ANSYS-workbench) results showed that ovality affects the load carrying capacity of the pipe bend and it was varying with bend factor (h). By data fitting of finite element results, an empirical formula for the limit load of inlet pigtail pipe bend with ovality has been proposed, which is validated by experiments...|$|R
