5|$|At {{the same}} time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a {{kindergarten}} in the nearby town of <b>Downers</b> Grove, which did not have a public school. Coonley purchased land on Grove Street and commissioned the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton to design the building. The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the Kindergarten Extension Association School in 1912. In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a first grade program was launched at the <b>Downers</b> Grove kindergarten, which was renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a second grade class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a third grade in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a fourth grade for nine-year-old students shortly thereafter.|$|E

A comparison of the operation stability between a CFB <b>downer</b> and a CFB riser showed that, although only one critical operating gas velocity exists in the CFB riser for a given riser solids flux, there can be many critical gas velocities for the operation of a CFB <b>downer.</b> Therefore, {{it is possible to}} achieve high solids concentration in a CFB <b>downer</b> if appropriate operating conditions are used. Parameters that affect the solids concentration in the CFB <b>downer</b> have been studied using the model and have been validated with experimental data obtained from a special CFB unit that incorporates a <b>downer.</b> Measures to increase the solids concentration in the <b>downer</b> have been proposed.

5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} <b>Downers</b> Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.|$|E
