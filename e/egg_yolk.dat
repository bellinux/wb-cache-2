5|$|Other {{structures}} {{around the}} convent are the Jesuit-built bastion, remnants {{of an old}} fortification and a bakery behind the convent which processes <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (unused from using egg as binder in construction of building) into broas (ladyfingers/sponge-fingers).|$|E
5|$|In hatching, mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with an egg tooth and {{are born with}} fully {{developed}} venom glands; capable of inflicting a potentially lethal bite minutes after hatching. The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues of the <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders {{have a better chance of}} survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> and sausages.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increased}} interest in enhancing the conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content of food products because of its potential health benefits. Inclusion of CLA in the diets of laying hens {{has led to the}} incorporation of CLA into <b>eggs,</b> changes in <b>yolk</b> fatty acid (FA) composition and non-acceptable greater firmness of hard-boiled <b>egg</b> <b>yolks.</b> This study was designed to develop instrumental tests to determine the texture characteristics of hard-boiled <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> obtained from hens fed diets supplemented with different levels of CLA and other fat sources. Two compression tests have established relationship between some FA levels added to diets and the firmness of boiled <b>egg</b> <b>yolks.</b> There were significant differences in the compression parameters among <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> from laying hens fed diets supplemented with 3 and 5 g kg- 1 of CLA (without other fats in diet) and commercial <b>egg</b> <b>yolks.</b> Supplementations with 30 and 35 g kg- 1 of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) in diets which included 3 g kg- 1 of CLA, decreased compression parameters to levels similar to commercial eggs...|$|R

A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
5|$|In this {{double-blind}} RCT, the preterm infants {{were fed}} either control formula containing phospholipids derived from <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> lecithin with sphingomyelin at 13% of total phospholipid or a supplemented formula with milk-derived phospholipids containing 20% sphingomyelin. Infants fed the supplemented formula {{had significantly higher}} percentages of sphingomyelin in total plasma phospholipids after 4, 6, and 8 weeks of feeding compared to those fed the control formula. The infants fed the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better scores on the Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group.|$|E

50|$|Pot de crème is {{made with}} <b>eggs,</b> <b>egg</b> <b>yolks,</b> cream, milk, and a flavor, often vanilla or chocolate.

5000|$|An egg coffee (cà phê trứng) is a Vietnamese drink {{which is}} {{traditionally}} prepared with <b>egg</b> <b>yolks,</b> sugar, condensed milk and Robusta coffee.

5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

25|$|The larvae of remipedes are lecithotrophic, {{consuming}} <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> {{rather than}} using external food sources. This characteristic, which is shared with malacostracan {{groups such as the}} Decapoda and Euphausiacea (krill) has been used to suggest a link between Remipedia and Malacostraca.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, some trivial names {{derive from}} a notable {{property}} of the thing being named. For instance, lecithin, the common name for phosphatidylcholine, was originally isolated from <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> The word is coined from the Greek λέκιθος (lékithos) for yolk.|$|E

25|$|Guidelines {{issued in}} September 1991 by Europe's Federation of the Condiment Sauce Industries {{recommend}} that oil and liquid <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> levels in mayonnaise {{should be at}} least 70% and 5%, respectively.

25|$|Steak tartare is a French dish {{made from}} finely chopped or ground (minced) raw meat (often beef).

It is often served with onions, capers, seasonings such as fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes raw <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close packing of the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its high viscosity. The viscoelasticity of mayonnaise made with <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> reaches a maximum very quickly after preparation.|$|E
25|$|The subtlety (or entremet), the fanciful {{and highly}} {{decorative}} surprise dish used to separate one course from another, {{was brought to}} new levels of complexity and refinement by the English chefs.
