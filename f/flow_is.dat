5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E

50|$|The major tributaries of the Slough are Tecolotito Creek, Carneros Creek, and Atascadero Creek. Tecolotito Creek's highest <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> {{during winter}} storms; {{during the summer}} <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> {{intermittent}}. Carneros Creek's major <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> of the flash flood type, with intermittent flows in the summer months. Atascadero Creek is a stream that generally has perennial freshwater <b>flow</b> that <b>is</b> augmented by seepage and landscape watering. Highest <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> during winter storms. Other <b>flow</b> sources <b>are</b> runoff from the north-facing bluffs of UC Santa Barbara campus and More Mesa.|$|R

Experimental results in both systems are well described by continuum models. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Parabronchi {{in which}} the air <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{unidirectional}} are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is bidirectional. These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flow</b> {{velocity}} <b>is</b> used {{to classify}} flows according to speed regime. Subsonic <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> <b>flow</b> fields {{in which the}} air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local <b>flow</b> speed <b>is</b> greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic <b>flows</b> <b>are</b> defined to <b>be</b> <b>flows</b> in which the <b>flow</b> speed <b>is</b> greater {{than the speed of}} sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the <b>flow</b> speed <b>is</b> much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.|$|R

5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|A <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> that shear stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E

5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|Gene <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E
5|$|Normal blood <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), {{and from}} superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

5|$|Prions are {{proteins}} {{of particular}} amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein {{with the same}} amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the information <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> Protein→Protein.|$|E

The last major U.S. diversion is at Imperial Dam, where over 90percent of the river's remaining <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> moved into the All-American Canal to irrigate California's Imperial Valley, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> pillow lava, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are glassy, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E
5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E

At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the <b>flow</b> <b>is</b> slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E
