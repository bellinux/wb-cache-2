25|$|A {{ventilator}} assists breathing {{using either}} pressure control or volume control {{based on the}} equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact {{is known as the}} equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: Pressure = (Elastance × Volume) + (Resistance × Flow)In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient’s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and <b>flow</b> <b>change</b> with changes in elastance and resistance.Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset.

Design/methodology/approachA total of 1, 212 different exchange-traded funds with a proprietary daily net fund flow data and logistic regressions were studied because the majority of the 1, 212 exchange-traded funds have mostly zero daily net fund <b>flow</b> <b>changes.</b> FindingsIt was documented that in the period December 22, 2005 to July 28, 2010 autocorrelation at the daily frequency is not universally present for the 1, 212 exchange-traded funds that we study, despite the fact that this is the case in the monthly data documented in prior studies. No support was found for the feedback trading hypothesis but some support was found for the contrarian investor hypothesis on daily basis, even though the opposite is ascertained for both in the prior literature monthly data. Also, it cannot be concluded that tracking error prompts net fund <b>flow</b> <b>changes</b> and thus arbitrage activity.

A pressure wave, which represents a rapid pressure and associated <b>flow</b> <b>change,</b> travels at sonic velocity for the liquid pipe medium, and the wave is partially transmitted and reflected at all discontinuities in the pipe system (pipe junctions, pumps, open or closed ends, surge tanks, etc.) A pressure wave can also be modified by pipe wall resistance.

CARDD control logic is one of the heuristic and distance automatic downstream control systems. In this research, mathematical model of the CARDD control logic coordinated with ICSS hydrodynamic model was developed and the CARDD control logic was tested and evaluated under different situations. In order to evaluate the performance of this control algorithm, one of the canals suggested by ASCE (canal number 2) was used. The CARDD control algorithm was tested under the operational scenarios suggested by ASCE in which the control algorithm was evaluated by intense and gradual <b>flow</b> <b>changes</b> in a newly constructed (tuned) canal. Performance indicators were calculated and analysed. In the case of gradual <b>flow</b> <b>changes,</b> the maximum diversion of the water depth from the target was about 5 % and was always in permitted range.

5000|$|A gate valve, {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife gate valve is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the <b>flow</b> <b>change</b> occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|E
50|$|Vojinovića Bridge is {{the oldest}} bridge in Kosovo. It {{is located in the}} north-west side of Vučitrn along the Pristina-Kosovska Mitrovica route. This route used to be an old track that {{connected}} Skopje and Raguza, thus connecting Kosovo to the Adriatic Sea. While being directly connected to the city center of Vučitrn, it played an important role of the city development during the 14th and 15th century. It was built over the Sitnica River, but since the 20th century it has remained on the dry ground because of river <b>flow</b> <b>change.</b> Since then it was used as an informal meeting point of the citizens, while today it is isolated and claimed as a specially protected area by the Ahtisari plan and has a status number 859/49. The Bridge is unique of its alternative red and white voussoirs. Its exact date of built is not known. Mr. Izet Miftari claims that the bridge was built during the Roman period or antiquity in the 2nd century. While according to professor Hilmi Saraçi, it was built during the economic growth of the Dardanian state of Illyria in the 5th century (article “Ancientness, designation, cultural, historical and archaeological heritage of the city of Vučitrn”). Serbian historians claim that the bridge was built {{at the end of the}} 14th century. The 135 m and 10.5 m bridge is asymmetrical and is composed of nine arches. The five pointed middle arches were built during the early medieval, Byzantine era, while the four semi-circular others during the Ottoman period.|$|E

Approximately 100 children commute to middle-level schools in neighboring Kama District, but the distance and time and cost needed for commuting prevent more children to seek post-primary education. There is no health facility in the village which the people are going for the treatment to the neighbors’ districts nearest clinics. According to UNHCR survey, the most common diseases in the village are diarrhoea, typhoid, and malaria. When the nearest CHC does not provide the satisfactory service, the villagers choose to travel to city hospitals in Jalalabad or to Peshawar, of Pakistan.

Most of the community people have their own open latrines and bathrooms.The source of irrigation water is Kumar-Kabul River. It is reported that irrigation water becomes scarce, due to River water <b>flow</b> <b>change,</b> from September to March. The villagers have a traditional water management system. In water-lacking season the farmer are irrigating their land by rotation. The total agricultural area is about 450 ha which 330 ha is irrigating by the local made intake and the rest is still under the treating of seasonal floods which not irrigating regularly.Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary livelihood activities inside Girdi Kas Village, followed by small-numbered other jobs such as shop keeping and governmental employment. However, there are not enough job opportunities in the village therefore the men are seeking for daily labor outside the village. Most of the young people of the community migrate to other cities to work in order to earn money for their families. As to the differences within the village, Wahdat sub-areas people suffer more from joblessness. Although this sub-area has the biggest male population and the percentage of working people is less.Prior to the prolonged conflict, Girdi Kas was famous for its agricultural production. Unfortunately, the village is yet to recover its previous abundant crop. According to the respondents in the village, the volume of agricultural production is not satisfactory. There is no major selling place (such as market and bazaar) for the village’s crops nearer than Jalalabad. Most crops are sent and sold in Jalalabad. The commercial activities within the village are very modest. There are approximately 25 small shops in the village, which serve for the residents’ everyday life, although too small in scale to be called an industry.|$|E
