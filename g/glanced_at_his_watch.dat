2500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 9, 1968, Raiford dropped off a couple of just-freed A {{students}} and was returning home when he violated the curfew. Raiford, now age 61, said he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> quietly exited his car, sensing something was not right. Raiford said he attempted to continue stealthily on foot, hoping the darkness of a neighborhood park would protect him.|$|E
60|$|We glided {{down into}} the Strand. Mr. Parker <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and up at Mr. Wrenn impatiently.|$|E
60|$|They waited, Jimmy quietly <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> now and then; {{and at last}} Moran {{stretched}} out a pointing hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the next}} few minutes," [...] he replied, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> [...] "I think we had better {{concentrate}} our attention upon catching our train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will, without doubt, have an opportunity," [...] Mr. Brott said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and {{suddenly}} rising. [...] "Dear me, how the time goes." ...|$|R
60|$|Deacon <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{simulated}} a weary yawn, {{and started}} to rise.|$|E
60|$|Peter Ruff <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was already}} {{half an hour}} past midnight.|$|E
60|$|The Prince <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and then}} at the bridge tables ready set out.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m afraid I can’t,” said Appleby, with a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> “Still, {{with your}} permission, I will walk {{a little of}} the way with you.” ...|$|R
60|$|The short {{afternoon}} was drawing toward its close when Vane {{came out of}} a large building in the city. <b>Glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> he stopped on the steps.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} well," [...] said he, {{looking out the}} window and <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour." ...|$|R
60|$|Brendon {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} a wave of the hand. He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Quest strolled {{off again}} and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> as he rejoined the little group.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> He was wholly {{unable to}} conceal his {{annoyance}} at their appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "At half-past two," [...] he announced, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> [...] "I have an {{appointment}} with a woollen manufacturer from Bradford. I hope {{to get him to}} join my council." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Carter will {{be waiting}} for us at the Palais Royal," [...] said one tourist to the other, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> and they clattered away, leaving the student to his labours.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly!" [...] Granet agreed, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "This is {{absolutely}} ripping! We shall be down there by one o'clock. Why is {{this to be}} Conyers' last day for entertaining?" ...|$|R
60|$|We stood now {{together}} on the pavement outside the station. My companion <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Wingate's nerves {{were all}} on edge. He <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and rose regretfully to his feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment on the pavement. Then he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and hailed a cab.|$|E
6000|$|He talked {{less and}} less, and the {{discussion}} of the sun-perishers died of mutual agreement as to its facts. Finally, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> he straightened up, yawned, stretched his arms and announced: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] said Edgar resignedly, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "It {{looks as}} if your men had taken their time. Flett should be here in {{about a quarter of}} an hour now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'New York,' {{said her}} father, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> 'let me see. It's just ten now, and there's {{a little over}} {{four and a half}} hours' difference. Oh, about half-past five in the afternoon.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Professor, who was comfortably {{seated in}} Quest's {{favourite}} easy-chair, <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{and shook his}} head.|$|E
60|$|Ray and I {{left the}} {{building}} together. As we turned into Pall Mall he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last, when Harding {{felt the}} tension {{becoming}} unendurable, Clarke <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and reopened the small bottle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have. There are one or {{two more}} matters which I have not yet {{mentioned}} to him, so I shall be glad to see you again in half an hour," [...] Mr. Ravenor remarked, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He cast a hurried <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{hanging on}} the wall beside him. It had RUN DOWN, {{although}} he had wound it the last thing before going to bed. He had evidently been lying there helpless beyond the twenty-four hours! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In one hour's time," [...] Peter Ruff said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> [...] "I {{shall present}} {{myself as a}} doctor at the cafe. Tell me the address. Tell me what to say which will insure my {{admission}} to Jean Lemaitre!" ...|$|R
60|$|The meal, a very {{excellent}} and somewhat prolonged one, {{came to a}} conclusion about ten o'clock. Morse <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|The sloop {{was close}} ahead, and {{slackening}} the paddling they ran alongside. Vane <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{when they had}} climbed on board.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{shook his}} head in bafflement, and <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> At any rate, in ten minutes, in less than ten minutes, he would hold her in his arms and know.|$|E
60|$|They waited anxiously, Grahame <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> {{and walking}} to the rail, where he felt the leadline; but the water rose with {{exasperating}} slowness. Then suddenly a jet of steam broke with a muffled throb from the escape-pipe, and Macallister jumped up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time is flying," [...] {{said the}} President in his gayest manner, after <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> which like {{everything}} about him seemed bigger than it ought to be. [...] "I must go off at once; I {{have to take the}} chair at a Humanitarian meeting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] he observed. [...] "Some of you Service fellows--not the Regulars, of course--do gas a {{good deal}} when you come back. I don't suppose you any of you know anything, so it doesn't really matter," [...] he added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
