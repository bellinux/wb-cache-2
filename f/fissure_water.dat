50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of underground hard rock mining is ventilation. Ventilation is the primary method of clearing hazardous gases and/or dust which are created from drilling and blasting activity (e.g., silica dust, NOx), diesel equipment (e.g., diesel particulate, carbon monoxide), or to protect against gases that are naturally emanating from the rock (e.g., radon gas). Ventilation is also used to manage underground temperatures for the workers. In deep, hot mines ventilation is used to cool the workplace; however, in very cold locations the air is heated to just above freezing before it enters the mine. Ventilation raises are typically used to transfer ventilation from surface to the workplaces, and can be modified for use as emergency escape routes. The primary sources of heat in underground hard rock mines are virgin rock temperature, machinery, auto compression, and <b>fissure</b> <b>water.</b> Other small contributing factors are human body heat and blasting.|$|E

Later, as the surface dries out, the water below the surface rises, carrying up dissolved minerals from lower layers.

However, measurements are strongly affected by subsurface heterogeneities such as fissures of different sizes and genesis (shrinking-swelling, macropores and deformation). In this work, we focus on surface fissures characterized by dimensions lower than the interelectrode spacing and correct their effect on apparent resistivity pseudo-sections by incorporating fissure geometry in the topography. We show that fissures with depths greater than 0. 10 times the interelectrode spacing for a dipole–dipole array and equal to 0. 16 for the gradient array and the Wenner–Schlumberger arrays create significant anomalies (greater than 5 [*]per[*]cent) in the pseudo-section.

The rocks of the Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest found in England; the geology {{is responsible for the}} quality of Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via <b>fissures.</b> Malvern <b>water</b> is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 L per minute to over 350 L per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|R

The article includes the characteristics of these springs and karst springs which were monitored.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Using {{chilled water}} within South African gold mines is {{paramount}} {{to the purpose}} of extracting gold ore efficiently. Using water for cooling, drilling and sweeping and the release of underground <b>fissure</b> <b>water</b> causes the accumulation of vast amounts of water in underground dams. Deep mines use cascading pump systems for dewatering, which is an electrical energy intensive dewatering method. Due to the recent equalisation of demand to generation capacity of electrical energy in South Africa, various methods towards demand side reduction have been implemented. With the introduction of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff structure by Eskom, the implementation of projects that shift load from peak TOU times to times of the day when electrical energy is less expensive has increased. To enable load shifting on mine dewatering pumps, preparation before and recovery after peak TOU is needed for effective results. This induces a preparation- and comeback load in the standard TOU. With an annual increase in TOU tariffs and the rate of increase of standard TOU being greater than that of the peak TOU, a reduction in electrical energy consumption before and after peak TOU is needed. To enable this, a step-by-step control technique was developed to promote the shifting of load from standard- to off-peak TOU, while still realising a full load shift from peak TOU. This technique entails dynamic control ranges of underground dam levels as opposed to the conventional constant control range method. Two case studies were used to test the developed technique. Results indicated significant additional financial savings when compared to conventional control methods.

During sampling in Beatrix gold mine (1. 4 km beneath the surface), central South Africa, CaCO 3 stalactites growing on the mine tunnel ceiling were collected and discovered, in two cases, to contain a living obligate brackish water/marine nematode species, Monhystrella parvella. After sterilization of the outer surface, mineral layers were physically removed from the outside to the interior, the DNA extracted. Based upon 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene sequencing, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya in different combinations were detected for each layer.. Using CT scan and electron microscopy the inner structure of CaCO 3 and salt stalactites were analyzed. CaCO 3 stalactites show a complex pattern of lamellae carrying bacterially precipitated mineral structures. Nematoda were clearly identified between these layers confirming that bacteria and nematodes live inside the stalactites and {{not only in the}} central straw. Salt stalactites exhibit a more uniform internal structure. Surprisingly, several Bacteria showing highest sequence identities to marine Bacteria were identified. This, together with the observation that the nematode M. parvella recovered from Beatrix gold mine stalactite can only survive in a salty environment makes the origin of the deep subsurface colonization enigmatic.

Drinking water resource protection usually comprises active and passive measures. Passive measures, consisting of different protection zones surrounding the recharge area of the drinking water abstraction point, are the most important and most widely used measures. In the paper is illustrated how the protection of drinking water is implemented through the Water Framework Directive. Protection zones are defined basedon the classification of drinking water resource types. They are divided into two groups; groundwater and surface water bodies. All of them are further divided into subgroups; groundwater into intergranular, karstic and <b>fissured</b> aquifers;surface <b>water</b> intostagnant and flowing water bodies. For all drinking waterre sources three protection zones aredefined:inner,middleand outer zone. The outer zone was defined as the total recharge zone of the water quantities abstracted. Insideof inner zone, abstraction point zone is defined,which is protected from unauthorized access. Protectionzones for intergranular aquifers are determined according to the isochrones based on travel times. Karstic aquifers are protected on the basis of intervention times and the level of the recharge zone karstification. Fissured aquifersare protected according to groundwater flow velocities;if the flow is laminar,the method of intergranular aquifers is used, otherwise the method of karstic aquifer is implemented. For surface water protection zones limitation method of distances, method of isochrones and dilution and method of intervention times are used...|$|R
