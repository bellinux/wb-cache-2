An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>to</b> promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E

Many new roads were built, and old roads were quickly repaired. Railroads were built relatively early, easing the collection and transportation of perishable sugar cane. It was now possible for plantations all over this large island to have their sugar shipped quickly and easily.|$|E

25|$|The British interceded {{to prevent}} more French {{expansion}} against Siam, but their price, in 1909 was {{the acceptance of}} British sovereignty over Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu, under the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. All of these ceded territories were {{on the fringes of}} the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under Siamese control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. In the early 20th century these crises were adopted by the increasingly nationalist government as symbols of the need <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> assert itself against the West and its neighbours.|$|E

In late 2001, Fischer hosted – under the auspices of the United Nations – a ten-day conference at the German government guesthouse above the Rhine River, where delegates from four Afghan factions signed the Bonn Agreement establishing a transitional government <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> replace the deposed Taliban regime. At the time, Germany's longstanding links to Afghanistan and its 2001 chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group of countries pledging humanitarian and reconstruction aid for the country, were the reasons it was picked to host the meeting.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{election}} was a surprise for the public, later investigations by newspaper Capital {{made clear that the}} appointment was not as spontaneous as claimed by BSP. In fact, it was carefully orchestrated and prepared long before BSP was able to form a cabinet. The appointment of Peevski caused widespread indignation. Even president Plevneliev spoke out against it and stated that the Cabinet of Prime Minister Oresharski has lost credibility. On 14 June 2013, Plevneliev cancelled his intended visit to Vidin for the unveiling of the Danube Bridge 2 due to his disagreement with the Peevski nomination. Political scientist Ivan Krastev commented that the Peevski appointment made sense only if the government had taken a decision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> leave the European Union. In the early phase of the protest, center-right politician and poet Edvin Sugarev began a hunger strike, though he was persuaded to discontinue it by family members after 22 days, as his worsening health condition necessitated a hospitalization.|$|E
