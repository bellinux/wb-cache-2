5|$|On 11 July 1965. Avro 748 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its nose-wheels <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> soft {{ground on the}} grass runway. The aircraft flipped over, losing its port wing in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{airborne}} division's brigades {{prepared to}} hold the positions they had captured, with the 5th Parachute Brigade, as the division's depth formation, <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> {{the east of the}} River Orne bridge. The 6th Airlanding Brigade was in the south between Longueval and Hérouvillette.|$|E
5|$|Chinese forces counterattacked, {{destroying}} a 3rd Infantry Division {{tank column}} sent {{to assist the}} Rangers and attacking the 3rd Ranger Company from three sides, as they <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> a hill. Though the Rangers eventually were forced to withdraw, {{the defense of the}} Rangers, the US 3rd Division and the British 29th Brigade had broken the momentum of the Chinese offensive.|$|E

50|$|The oldest Buddhist temples in Okinawa, the Ryufuku-ji and Gokuraku-ji, are nearby, {{along with}} Urasoe yōdore, {{the site of}} the royal mausolea of several kings of Chūzan, <b>dug</b> {{directly}} <b>into</b> the cliffside.|$|R
5|$|Deir al-Balah {{remained}} in Egyptian hands until around 1150 BC when the Philistines conquered the southern coastal area of Canaan. The Philistine settlement {{is thought to}} have been situated southwest of the excavation site; its remains are hidden under large sand dunes. Five pits <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the Late Bronze Age layers and containing Philistine pottery are among the few findings from that period.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the ground before the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|A {{chemical}} weapons storage facility {{is believed to}} be located in the county's Chiha-ri precinct. The facility is said to include numerous tunnels <b>dug</b> deep <b>into</b> the mountains, and may also host some biological weapons.|$|R

50|$|The wetter eastern {{valleys of}} Bhutan {{tend to be}} steep, narrow ravines, with {{settlements}} <b>dug</b> directly <b>into</b> mountainsides. Walls are more often made of stone in these regions, {{as opposed to the}} rammed earth more prevalent in the west.|$|R
5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the ground as the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so that it may be protected from desecration. It was only unearthed {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> {{the side}} of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> {{the sides}} of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E
50|$|Roman and Islamic house {{foundations}} {{have been}} <b>dug</b> deeply <b>into</b> older layers of habitation. Building remains with mosaic pavement with writing in Greek {{has been found}} on the site (called 'Aqd al-Qin) of a former church. Byzantine ceramics have also been found.|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{mechanisms by}} which the larvae of sympatric Chilean populations of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. hydei and D. busckii select pupation sites are {{described in terms of}} larval substrate preferences. These species share the same breeding sites in Central Valley of Chile. It is important to investigate larval substrate preferences to pupate in sympatric natural populations of species of Drosophila because such behavior could contribute to the coexistence of the species in the wild. D. busckii larvae preferred humid substrates with a smooth surface to pupate, whereas D. simulans larvae selected humid substrates with a rough surface. Larvae of D. melanogaster chose dry and humid substrates with a rough surface, whereas D. hydei larvae occupied dry substrates with a smooth surface to form puparia. D. melanogaster larvae <b>dug</b> deeper <b>into</b> dry than into humid sand, whereas D. simulans larvae <b>dug</b> more <b>into</b> humid sand. D. busckii larvae pupated in the upper layers of humid and dry sand, and D. hydei larvae <b>dug</b> more <b>into</b> humid than into dry sand. Pupae of the four Drosophila species showed aggregated distributions on the substrates. Larval prepupation behaviors of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. hydei and D. busckii could be important to their coexistence in the wild...|$|R

5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|The player {{initially}} {{can see a}} top-down view of the surface-level of {{the fortress}} site; each layer of a z-axis level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level {{would be seen as}} its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> a room.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} {{occupied}} by 1st Commonwealth Division, Chinese communist forces were <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> {{a group of}} hills overlooking the Imjin River. The division faced 6,000 troops from the Chinese 191st Division, 64th Army under the overall command of Xie Zhengrong. The Chinese forces were divided into three regiments of about 2,000 men each, with two regiments dug-in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection, and a third regiment in support. The 28th Brigade faced {{one of the two}} forward regiments—the 571st Regiment—which was deployed with one battalion on Hill 355, a second battalion astride Hill 217 and Hill 317, and a third battalion in reserve to the west.|$|E

Hungrier customers would have <b>dug</b> deeper <b>into</b> their pockets for a full, cooked breakfast for $1.85.|$|R
50|$|Corporal Robert S. Betnar was {{assigned}} to the investigation. He discovered inconsistencies with Geiger's testimonies during the initial investigation and <b>dug</b> deeper <b>into</b> the case. Geiger, now 43, was unemployed and residing in nearby Pottsville with a wife and young son. Betnar decided to redo the investigation from scratch.|$|R
5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> {{the sides of}} {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinctive}} timber building traditions {{found their}} confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was {{the practice of}} log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique {{thought to have been}} imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the stave building tradition (typically found in stave churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of defenses south of the capital city, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I, IX, and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces on 25 January, Operation Thunderbolt. The three corps advanced north with IX Corps {{at the center of}} the line, on both sides of the Han River. The corps were to advance steadily northward, protected by heavy artillery and close air support, until they captured Seoul. IX Corps was tasked with capturing Chipyong-ni, southeast of Seoul while providing support to the other two corps. However, it encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the hilly country around Chipyong-ni and was still bogged down in combat by 2 February. Chinese forces had established machine gun nests in the hillside and mined roads to slow the corps' advance. In response, X Corps launched Operation Roundup, hoping to take pressure off of IX Corps and to force the Chinese to abandon Seoul.|$|E

50|$|After {{clearing}} the property, the couple began planting {{a variety of}} grapes to produce wine. In the 1870s, Schram <b>dug</b> cellars <b>into</b> hills on the property and by 1876 Schramsberg was producing 12,000 gallons. Within a few years, Schramsberg had expanded to over 50 acre and was producing 12,000 cases each year.|$|R
40|$|The archaeological {{excavations}} in Vico III Lanusei, {{within the}} urban area of Cagliari, {{were carried out}} between 1996 and 1997. The work was supervised by Donatella Mureddu of the Archaeological Authorities for the Provinces of Cagliari and Oristano. The stratigraphic excavation of the site has brought to light various inhabited and funerary areas, testifying to their use from the late republican period through to the Middle Ages. Differing types of burial have been discovered in the area. In particular, one was <b>dug</b> directly <b>into</b> the rock, three were in coffins and two were Capuchin type burials. In this paper a description is provided {{of the results of}} the anthropological study of the human skeletal remains found in the burial <b>dug</b> directly <b>into</b> the rock. In the grave there were four infants in a supine position, placed on a later dates...|$|R
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft <b>dug</b> <b>into</b> the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E
