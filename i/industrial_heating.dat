40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>heat</b> {{recovery}} {{can be used}} {{in district}} heating systems. It is a possibility to make use of heat that is otherwise lost. Increased usage of <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recovery reduces the need for fuel combustion lowering green-house gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO 2. Industrial companies can, however, move or close down industrial activities. This is apprehended as a risk and lowers the interest of district heating companies to invest in <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recovery. In Swedish district <b>heating</b> systems, <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recoveries have been undertaken since 1974. Today, the heat recovery is active in about seventy systems. This leads {{to the question of how}} risky it is, for district heating companies, to engage in <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recovery. Over forty years of operation statistics have been collected and analyzed in order to estimate the risk of <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recovery to district heating companies. Key results show that the risk is not linked to different industrial branches. Recommendations include suggestions to management on how to consider risk and consequence when assessing potential <b>industrial</b> <b>heat</b> recovery investments...|$|R

50|$|In January 2014 a {{newly formed}} company, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Heat</b> LLC, {{announced}} that it had acquired rights to Rossi's E-Cat technology. In April 2016, Rossi filed a lawsuit in the USA against <b>Industrial</b> <b>Heat,</b> alleging {{that he was not}} paid an $89 million licensing fee due after a one-year test period of an E-Cat unit. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Heat's</b> comment on the lawsuit was that after three years of effort they were unable to reproduce Rossi's E-Cat test results.In July 2016 the judge dismissed parts of the suit, but allowed others to proceed, setting a trial date for June 26, 2017. On July 5, 2017 (the fourth day of the trial) the parties settled. The terms of the settlement were not released.|$|R
25|$|Some European {{countries}} {{produce a}} significant fraction of their electricity needs from wood or wood wastes. In Scandinavian countries {{the costs of}} manual labor to process firewood is very high. Therefore, {{it is common to}} import firewood from countries with cheap labor and natural resources. The main exporters to Scandinavia are the Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). In Finland, there is a growing interest in using wood waste as fuel for home and <b>industrial</b> <b>heating,</b> in the form of compacted pellets.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent bulbs {{are much}} less {{efficient}} than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for <b>industrial</b> <b>heating</b> and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared {{with other types of}} lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.|$|E
25|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil fuel on the planet, and widely used {{as the source of}} energy in thermal power stations. It is a relatively cheap fuel, with some of the largest deposits in regions that are stable politically, such as China, India and the United States. This contrasts with natural gas, the largest deposits of which are located in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan and the US. Solid coal cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications, petroleum is mostly used for transportation and the natural gas not used for electricity generation is used for space, water and <b>industrial</b> <b>heating.</b> Coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel, but the efficiencies and economics of such processes can make them unfeasible. Vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more greenhouse gas and pollution than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E
