We have to do more for these {{children}} that didn't ask to be born into this." [...] Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, [...] "Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side." [...] Langford added, [...] "I don't know of anybody starving down here." [...] Kennedy responded, [...] "Step over here and I'll introduce you to some." [...] Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to [...] "find fault," [...] but rather [...] "just to see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything about it." ...|$|E

They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E
500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
