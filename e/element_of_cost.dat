As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> involved, either social or economic.

40|$|Space {{transportation}} {{is currently a}} major <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> for communications satellite systems. For every dollar spent in manufacturing the satellite, somewhere between 1 and 3 dollars must be spent to launch the satellite into its initial operational orbit.

It seems apparent then, that tremendous economic advantage for satellite communications systems can be gained from improvements in two key highly leveraged propulsion areas. The first and most important economic improvement can be achieved by significantly lowering the cost of today's launch vehicles. The second gain that would greatly benefit the communications satellite business position is to increase both the useful (payload) weight placed into the orbit and the revenue generating lifetime of the satellite on-orbit. The point {{of this paper is to}} first explain that these two goals can best be achieved by cost reduction and performance increasing advancements in rocket propulsion for both the launch vehicle and for the satellite on-board apogee insertion and on-orbit velocity control systems...|$|E

Managed care plans and politicians have seen constraints on ED use as an important <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> control. METHODS: We measured ED-associated and other medical care costs, using the recently released 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey of approximately 35, 000 persons in 14, 000 households representative of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. RESULTS: In 1987, total ED expenditures were $ 8. 9 billion, or 1. 9 % of national health expenditures. People with health insurance represented 86 % {{of the population and}} accounted for 88 % of ED spending. The uninsured paid 47 % of ED costs themselves; free care covered only 10 %. For the uninsured, the cost of hospitalization initiated by ED visits totaled $ 3. 3 billion, including $ 1. 1 billion in free care. Whites accounted for 75 % of total ED costs. The ED costs of poor and near-poor individuals accounted for only 0. 47 % of national health costs. CONCLUSIONS: ED use accounts for a small share of US medical care costs, and cost shifting to the insured to cover free ED care for the uninsured is modest. Constraining ED use cannot generate substantial cost savings but may penalize minorities and the poor, who receive much of their outpatient care in EDs...|$|E
60|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> Production {{consists}} <b>of</b> several <b>elements,</b> some <b>of</b> {{which are}} constant and universal, others occasional. The universal <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production are {{the wages of}} the labor, and the profits of the capital. The occasional elements are taxes, and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value {{of some of the}} requisites. Besides the natural and necessary <b>elements</b> in <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production—labor and profits—there are others which are artificial and casual, as, for instance, a tax. The taxes on hops and malt are as much a part <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production of those articles as the wages of the laborers. The expenses which the law imposes, as well as those which the nature of things imposes, must be reimbursed with the ordinary profit from the value of the produce, or the things will not continue to be produced. But the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits. It is not general taxation, but differential taxation, that produces the effect. If all productions were taxed so as to take an equal percentage from all profits, relative values would be in no way disturbed. If only a few commodities were taxed, their value would rise; and if only a few were left untaxed, their value would fall.|$|R

40|$|It is {{expected}} that ultimately, like offshore wind farms, electrical systems will make up to {{a quarter of the}} overall Capex of wave farms. This is a significant <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> and consideration must be taken in the design of both individual wave energy converters (WECs) and arrays of WECs to ensure that these costs can be minimised. In a worst case scenario design decisions could increase the cost of the electrical system by several orders and ultimately make the technology uncompetitive. This paper outlines the impacts on the cost of the electrical system arising from design factors of WECs and WEC arrays or wave farms. The paper uses a cost model to examine the impact to the cost of WEC array electrical systems caused by changing of key design factors. The design factors examined include WEC unit rating, capacity factor, interface to the electrical network, array spacing, export voltage, array design, site selection, export distance, and WEC dynamic response. All of these design factors {{have an impact on the}} economics of the electrical system and hence the economics of the wave farm as a whole. The paper concludes that there are some critical design choices which should be avoided if a cost-effective wave farm is to be established. It is also concluded that some design choices could ultimately reduce the overall Capex of WEC arrays enhancing their competiveness...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{approaches}} {{to the analysis of}} economic performance is the concept of variable and fixed costs. This concept analyzes the relationship between corporate costs and profits. The tightness of this relationship (i. e. the costs variability rate) is an essential <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> and profit management in different periods of a business life cycle. The type of business activity (production, trade and services) has a significant influence on the relationship between costs and profit (in particular of the operating type). This relationship can be examined mainly {{on the basis of the}} financial development of economic sectors. This article deals with the relationship between operating costs and operating profits in selected business sectors. For the analysis, the concept of synthetic and analytic cost model is used. The tightness of the relationship between operating costs and operating profits is determined by the method of correlation analysis. The quarterly data on the development of the Czech economy for the period of 2007 – 2010 represent the basis of the analysis; this period includes a phase of growth, of decline and of stagnation. The analysis of the costs variability allows us to understand the behavior of the “average” companies in various sectors in creating their costs and their management with the aim of achieving a profit. The results of the analysis show that the most companies are able to “control” their operating costs significantly in the relation to realized outputs; at the same time this means that a substantial part of the operating costs has a character of variable costs...|$|E
