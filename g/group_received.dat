5|$|During World War II, Johnson {{was one of}} {{the first}} four flying {{officers}} of the Eighth Air Force, and served on it staff during its formative period at Savannah, Georgia. In 1943, he assumed command of the 44th Bombardment Group, which flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Johnson led the attack on the German naval installations at Kiel in May 1943 and the attack on the Ploesti oil fields in August 1943, for which the 44th Bombardment <b>Group</b> <b>received</b> Distinguished Unit Citations.

5|$|Plutonium is a {{synthetic}} element with complicated physical, chemical and metallurgical properties. It is {{not found in}} nature in appreciable quantities. Until mid-1944, the only plutonium that had been isolated had been produced in cyclotrons in microgram amounts, whereas weapons required kilograms. In April 1944, physicist Emilio Segrè, {{the head of the}} Los Alamos Laboratory's P-5 (Radioactivity) <b>Group,</b> <b>received</b> the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge. He discovered that, in addition to the plutonium-239 isotope, it also contained significant amounts of plutonium-240.

On the way home at 09:20, III./JG 53 were intercepted by 366th Fighter Squadron. Altogether, III./JG 53 lost 10 Bf 109s and one damaged to the 358th Fighter Group. Of the 25 III./JG 53 Bf 109s that took part, 11 were shot down representing 40% of the attacking force.

On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May. It was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to explore whether {{increased}} frequency {{of exposure to the}} perceptual demands of a coincident-timing task (perceptual modeling) prior to actively practicing the motor component of the task would result in increased timing accuracy on initiation of practice. Increased accuracy following a high frequency of modeling would presumably be due to an enhanced cognitive representation for the skill. Forty-four subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four different groups: a control <b>group</b> <b>receiving</b> no perceptual modeling, a <b>group</b> <b>receiving</b> one chance to experience the perceptual demands of the task prior to active practice (perceptual modeling), a <b>group</b> <b>receiving</b> five chances, or a <b>group</b> <b>receiving</b> ten chances. Results indicated that perceptual modeling at any frequency enhanced the accuracy of the cognitive representation and decreased timing errors, as each perceptual modeling group differed significantly from the control group. However, none of the <b>groups</b> <b>receiving</b> modeling differed significantly from any other. Thus, increased frequency of exposure was not superior to limited exposure for this particular task. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

5|$|The attackers {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the <b>group</b> <b>received</b> help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The <b>group</b> <b>received</b> {{an influx}} of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and {{challenging}} his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E
