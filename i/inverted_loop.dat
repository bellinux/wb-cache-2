40|$|Exchange {{bias and}} <b>inverted</b> {{hysteresis}} <b>loops</b> {{were observed in}} the Cr 2 O 3 coated CrO 2 particles with a wide distribution of the blocking temperature. The ferromagnetic coupling between the CrO 2 cores and Cr 2 O 3 shell is responsible for exchange bias observed below 292 K. In the temperature range of 261 K-similar to 340 K, the particles show <b>inverted</b> hysteresis <b>loops,</b> i. e., the negative remanence and coercivity. The most interesting observation is that the particles show an exchange-biased (or shifted) <b>inverted</b> hysteresis <b>loops</b> in between 261 K and 292 K; and that the maximum negative remanence appears at 292 K where exchange bias disappears. An antiferromagnetic type of interaction between the blocked particles and the superparamagnetic particles {{is believed to be}} responsible to the <b>inverted</b> hysteresis <b>loops.</b> (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

This record was quickly surpassed by Steel Hawg at Indiana Beach on July 5, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 November 1941 Lorenzini {{lost control}} of her aircraft, a Focke-Wulf, while {{conducting}} her famous <b>inverted</b> <b>loop,</b> and crashed. She was killed immediately. The accident happened in Morón during an aerobatics exhibition for a visiting group of Uruguayan aviators. It was later reported that Lorenzini had been flying an aircraft she was unfamiliar with {{and that she had}} been extremely angry {{on the day of the}} exhibition due to an ongoing issue with the organisers of the event.|$|E
50|$|The {{first test}} flight was {{conducted}} by Harold Dale on 30 March 1956. The aircraft completed several spin tests, but during one test the canopy opened and the aircraft went into an inverted spin. The pilot bailed out safely and the prototype crashed after performing an unmanned <b>inverted</b> <b>loop.</b> It was later found that the trim tab was set to full nose-down attitude during the test. A scheduled demonstration of the aircraft for the U.S. Navy was canceled. No other Weejets were produced.|$|E
50|$|Yankee Harbor is themed {{around a}} harbor. Batman: The Ride, {{which is the}} world's first <b>{{inverted}}</b> <b>looping</b> coaster, travels through 5 inversions at high speeds. V2: Vertical Velocity, an Intamin inverted impulse coaster, is also located in Yankee Harbor. Yankee Clipper is an Arrow Dynamics flume and was the original central attraction of the area.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, a Bolliger & Mabillard {{designed}} {{roller coaster}} called Talon was added near the now-front entrance of park. The ride was a steel <b>inverted</b> <b>looping</b> coaster with ski lift type seats, and approximately {{the size of}} the Raptor coaster at Cedar Point. The addition of the new adult coaster brought the park's roller coaster count to nine.|$|R

5000|$|After {{decades of}} social {{democratic}} governments, the Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren faced an infamous marginal tax rate of 102% in 1976, in effect creating a wage ceiling. Though the example was {{partly due to}} <b>inverted</b> <b>loop</b> holes in the tax code, the figure {{was seen as an}} important catalyst for the results in the election that year, in which the Social Democratic Party lost power after 40 consecutive years in power. After a [...] "tax rebellion" [...] and demanded the top marginal tax rates were reduced to 50% in the late 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{opened in}} 1988, Red Devil was renamed Cliffhanger in 2007 {{and given a}} new paint job. [...] The coaster is unique in that rather than {{boarding}} the train and being towed up the lift hill, its boarding station {{is at the top}} of the hill. Once riders boarded, the train rolled out of the station, around a 90-degree curve and then over the main drop and into its one <b>inverted</b> <b>loop.</b> The rest of the track extends over the edge of the mountain with great views of the surrounding mountains. Cliffhanger's reopening was pushed back through the 2007 and 2008 seasons because of necessary major repairs.|$|E
50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the manual brake release under the C brake while the other ran the control panel brake in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second <b>inverted</b> <b>loop.</b> The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Magic Mountain added what {{two other}} Six Flags parks already had, a Bolliger & Mabillard <b>{{inverted}}</b> <b>looping</b> roller coaster called Batman: The Ride (which other Six Flags parks also {{added in the}} coming years). Batman: the Ride (BTR) is an inverted coaster, meaning the usual coaster protocol is reversed; the track is overhead and the cars are below it. The trains travel {{on the outside of}} the loops, and rider's legs hang freely, as on a ski lift.|$|R
50|$|The Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 is a light, twin-engine, {{multi-purpose}} helicopter developed by Bölkow of Ottobrunn, Germany.

50|$|That afternoon, a {{color picture}} {{taken in the}} coaster {{simulation}} game NoLimits surfaced. The picture depicted the ride's <b>inverted</b> <b>loop</b> element {{as well as one}} of the Corkscrew inversions. At 11:11 pm, as promised, the 25 who received the puzzle pieces received user names and passwords to log into the Nantimi website and view computer generated footage of the ride. However, someone soon managed to access the video without logging in. The video was deleted soon after this incident. Also, shortly after the 25 received their puzzle pieces, 11 of the 25 players were invited to be the first riders on Fahrenheit during opening day in May. At noon on September 27, along with the announcement of the ride, Fahrenheit, Hersheypark confirmed that they were behind the game. According to a press release put out by the park, the Nantimi website attracted more than 34,000 hits from 47 states and 28 countries.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, Vekoma's first Mind Eraser, an <b>inverted</b> <b>looping</b> {{suspended}} coaster, was added. This was branded a SLC. In 1996, a free-fall drop-down ride {{called the}} Tower of Doom and made by Intamin was added. In 1997, the park added a second dry water ride called Typhoon Sea Coaster, {{which was a}} log flume/junior rollercoaster hybrid. It was later renamed Skull Mountain and eventually closed in July 2011 {{to make room for}} a new roller coaster. In 1997, the water park was renovated, eliminating some older slides, adding newer slides and extensively remodeling the children's water play area.|$|R
50|$|Austrian {{manufacturer}} Aquarena {{developed the}} world's first mass-produced fully <b>inverted</b> <b>looping</b> water slide, {{known as the}} AquaLoop.

5000|$|Windsurfing {{can be said}} to {{straddle}} {{both the}} laid-back culture of surf sports and the more rules-based environment of sailing. Although it might be considered a minimalistic version of a sailboat, windsurfing offers experiences that are outside the scope of other sailing craft designs. Windsurfers can perform jumps, <b>inverted</b> <b>loops,</b> spinning maneuvers, and other [...] "freestyle" [...] moves that cannot be matched by any sailboat. Windsurfers were the first to ride the world's largest waves, such as Jaws on the island of Maui, and, with very few exceptions, {{it was not until the}} advent of tow-in surfing that waves of that size became accessible to surfers on more traditional surfboards. Extreme waves aside, many expert windsurfers will ride the same waves as surfers do (wind permitting).|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of inverted hysteresis loops (IHLs) in magnetic materials {{is still in}} debate {{due to the lack}} of direct evidence and convincing theoretical explanations. Here we report the direct observation and physical interpretation of complete IHL in Ni 45 Fe 55 films with 1 to 2 nm thin Ni 3 Fe secondary phases at the grain boundaries. The origin of the <b>inverted</b> <b>loop,</b> however, is shown to be due to the exchange bias coupling between Ni 45 Fe 55 and Ni 3 Fe, which can be broken by the application of a high magnetic field. A large positive exchange bias (HEB= 14 ×HC) is observed in the NiFe composite material giving novel insight into the formation of a noninverted hysteresis loop (non-IHL) and IHL, which depend on the loop tracing field range (HR). The crossover from non-IHL to IHL is found to be at 688 Oe...|$|E

5000|$|Riders {{exit the}} station and climb a 90 ft hill. Unique to Great Bear, there is a helix {{immediately}} after the lift, swinging riders around into the 124 ft drop into The Hollow. After the drop, the train enters a loop, followed immediately by an Immelmann loop, and then going into a zero-g roll. Riders continue through The Hollow over midway areas, making a sharp turn over Spring Creek. After a short straightaway, the train goes into a corkscrew, and then up a hill with two wide turns. For the 2014 season, the on-ride camera's location was changed to just after the corkscrew inversion, on the same pole that houses the on-ride camera for SooperDooperLooper. The train then enters a short brake run; after the brake-run, riders return to the station. Great Bear was the first <b>inverted</b> <b>looping</b> coaster in Pennsylvania.|$|R
40|$|We report {{detailed}} {{studies of}} the ac susceptibility butterfly hysteresis on the Ru 1222 ruthenocuprate compounds. Two separate contributions to these hysteresis have been identified and studied. One contribution is ferromagnetic-like and {{is characterized by the}} coercive field maximum. Another contribution, represented by the so called inverted maximum, is related to the unusual <b>inverted</b> <b>loops,</b> unique feature of Ru 1222 butterfly hysteresis. The different nature of the two identified magnetic contributions is proved by the different temperature dependences involved. By lowering the temperature the inverted peak gradually disappears while the coercive field slowly raises. If the maximum dc field for the hysteresis is increased, the size of the inverted part of the butterfly hysteresis monotonously grows while the position of the peak saturates. In reaching saturation exponential field dependence has been demonstrated to take place. At T = 78 K the saturation field is 42 Oe. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evaluation of}} a novel attitude estimation algorithm (Kamali et al. (2013)) for a high performance fighter aircraft. This algorithm employs a new modelling approach in the Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) framework to estimate aircraft attitude information without using forward acceleration sensor, Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors or magnetometer. Evaluation of the algorithm is conducted using flight data from a high performance fighter aircraft and using flight simulation data. Estimation results during various manoeuvres such as full rolls, <b>inverted</b> <b>loops,</b> split-S manoeuvres, steep climbs, and dives, are studied. Effect of different wind perturbations (gust, shear,turbulence, etc.), on estimation results, is also studied. Results using flight data are compared with those obtained from a GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS), whereas for results using simulation data, the simulation itself provides true values. Conclusions are drawn {{for the performance of}} the algorithm based on simulation and flight data. ...|$|R

40|$|The local {{magnetization}} profile {{along the}} length in magnetostrictive Fe-based magnetic microwires has been determined by magneto-optical Kerr effect. The study has been performed in microwires with different geometrical dimensions (i. e., diameter and length). The profiles of remanent magnetization and coercivity remain constant at the middle part for all microwires, whereas significant reduction of net magnetization accompanied by significant change of coercivity is observed when approaching their ends. This local region extends just few tens of micrometer for thin (around 1 μm diameter) wires and up to several hundreds of micrometer for thick (around 10 μm diameter) wires. That predicts that critical length to observe bistability goes from 50 μm to nearly 1 mm as diameter increases from 1 to 10 μm. Results are further interpreted considering the local distribution of magnetic charges at the ends which, arising to reduce stray fields, lead {{in some cases to}} <b>inverted</b> <b>loops.</b> © 2013 American Institute of Physics.
