50|$|Easements {{may also}} arise by {{implication}} where a vendor sells one {{plot of land}} but retains another neighbouring plot. Easements may arise in favour of the retained plot (reservation) or the sold plot (grant). Because a presumption operates that a vendor will have had ample opportunity to insert into the documents of sale a clause in his favour, the scope of implied reservation is much smaller than that of <b>implied</b> <b>grant.</b> Where the vendor sells two neighbouring plots (as determined by time of contract, not of conveyance) both plots will fall under the rules of <b>implied</b> <b>grant</b> {{with regard to the}} other. Two plots sold at the same auction will fall under provision, for example, but a period of a month between contracts is too long. Implied easements act at law, not in equity, because the effect is the same as if the provision had been express. Any requirement of registration would clearly be incompatible with the concept of an implied easement, so none is applied.|$|E
50|$|Even if {{the agent}} does act without authority, the {{principal}} may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated.

50|$|Mrs Edna Crow, Stone House Farm of North Riding, sued Mr Robin Wood, or Wether Cote Farm, Hawnby, for his sheep straying {{into her}} land, alleging cattle trespass. She {{lived on a}} Yorkshire moor, long in common {{ownership}} where sheep {{had the right to}} stray, but then parcels were sold off, each maintaining a right to stray, which Ms Crow did not exercise but Mr Wood did. From 1966 on Ms Crow ceased to keep up a fence. Mr Wood claimed that under an <b>implied</b> <b>grant</b> at common law and Law of Property Act 1925, section 62, she was under a duty to keep up her fences for the benefit of those with grazing rights on the moor.|$|E
50|$|The second {{category}} includes cases like Wong v Beaumont Property Trust Ltd (although in that case, it operated {{to bring about}} an <b>implied</b> <b>grant).</b> The defendant leased a series of cellars to the claimant, requiring that they be used only as a restaurant. In order to comply with trading laws, however, the claimant was required by law, if he wished to use the cellars as a restaurant, to install ventilation ducts {{on the part of}} the building retained by the defendant. The Court decided to imply a grant in that case because it was necessary for the carrying on the business required in the lease. As stated by Lord Atkinson in that case, it must be necessary, not merely reasonable or common in properties of that type or in that location. Where the right is reciprocal, for example support, then the rules of necessity are more relaxed.|$|E

40|$|A aguardar publicação. In {{terms of}} the {{representation}} of apocalyptic vision in modern English literature, there {{is a set of}} texts produced around 1816 by a group of Romantic authors that constitutes the most immediate response to climate change – a sense {{of the end of the}} world caused by untimely darkness and stormy weather. A brief three-year period of reduced sunlight in the northern hemisphere, caused by a major volcanic eruption, suggested to Byron a world in which human civilization, having lost every vestige of social contract, was finally extinguished in cannibalism. Though less famous than Mary Shelley’s novel, and its scenery of frozen Alpine wastes, Byron’s poem “Darkness” (1816) expresses in even more vivid imagery the sense of impending doom, the imminent collapse of social order, and the consequent threat to the human species that pervades Frankenstein (1818). The poem has been read both as a dream-vision with references to the Apocalypse and the De Rerum Natura of Lucretius and as a kind of figurative biography, an unfiltered response to the chaotic upheavals that rocked Byron’s personal life during the year of its composition. A more political dimension may also be derived from this text if we have in consideration its historical context of the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars in Europe. Indeed, within the artistic framework of the lyric in blank verse, Byron’s personal, political and ecological visions of the world are here jointly presented. In particular, the multiple levels of chaos that are <b>implied</b> <b>grant</b> particular significance to the ideas formulated in the poem’s final lines; ‘Darkness’ becomes a new and tangible entity, capable of shaping the universe in her own image. The possibility of a new universal order is represented by the dominion of a powerful universal femininity, whose disturbing sublimity is constructed upon the essentially masculine domain of the ‘old world’ that crumbles. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|E
40|$|States rely {{on state}} {{ownership}} of the beds of streams, rivers, and lakes for various regulatory and proprietary purposes. These include licensing of bed use, leasing of underlying mineral rights, protection of public use rights, assertion of public trust powers, and location of boundaries of abutting privately owned land. The extent of this state ownership in states created from federal territories is determined by a conjunction of the following: (1) the 2 ̆ 2 equal footing rule, 2 ̆ 2 (2) the law of federal land patent interpretation, (3) state rules on incidents to title to abutting uplands, (4) federal and state definitions of navigability, and (5) the law of <b>implied</b> <b>grants</b> of land from the sovereign. States have asserted title to the beds of many streams, rivers, and lakes by assuming the correctness of certain interpretations of these rules of law. This article reexamines those interpretations. It summarizes {{the basic structure of}} bed title law and examines its current status under recent Supreme Court decisions. It then analyzes the cases to determine the location of title of beds of federally nonnavigable inland waters when a state created from a federal territory asserts such title...|$|R

40|$|Accountants {{agree that}} nonqualified stock options are compensatory. However, {{only a limited}} amount of {{remuneration}} cost is recognized on the date that such options are granted; frequently, there is no recognition. Hence, the income numbers reported by grantor firms may be over-stated owing to such lack of recognition. In this regard, the objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the value of compensation <b>implied</b> in <b>grants</b> of stock options, and to present evidence pertaining to the materiality of the impact these estimates have on income from continuing operations of selected firms. The Black and Scholes option pricing model was selected to estimate the value of a stock option. This formula provides a probabilistic point estimate of the market value of a call option. A restrictive set of assumptions underlie the derivation of this formula, but empirical studies indicate that alterations of the model to accommodate violations of these assumptions fail to impart greater predictive ability. The standard Black and Scholes formula was used to estimate the compensation <b>implied</b> in <b>grants</b> of stock options during 1978 for a non-random sample of 171 firms. These estimates were adjusted for amounts related to such grants that had already been recorded. Since most firms granted options having exercise prices equal to the market prices of the optioned shares, such adjustments were infrequent. The resulting incremental compensation estimate was divided by income from continuing operations, giving an option compensation index for each enterprise in the sample. Assuming 10 percent, 5 percent, and 3 percent materiality thresholds, income from continuing operations is materially reduced for 16 percent, 31 percent, and 47 percent of the sampled firms, respectively. A statistical analysis suggests systematic association between the magnitude of the compensation index and the classification of the industry in which the enterprise operates. Other statistical tests indicate that estimates of compensation <b>implied</b> in <b>grants</b> of stock options are material for large firms in the manufacturing and retail sectors, and for small firms in the manufacturing, retail, and banking-finance sectors. These statistical results must be interpreted circumspectly owing to the non-random sample. Nevertheless, this evidence supports a re-examination of the accounting methods for stock options...|$|R

Estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios of Antiretroviral Drug Therapies (ARVs) in the literature were examined.
