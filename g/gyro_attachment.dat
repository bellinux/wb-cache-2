40|$|In the UK we have 41 repeat {{stations}} {{with each}} being occupied once every four years. The measurement technique uses a fluxgate theodolite, two proton precession magnetometers and a geodetic-quality GPS for determining true north with a north-seeking <b>gyro</b> <b>attachment</b> as a the back-up. The data are then processed {{to reduce the}} effect of time-varying fields and then a model is fitted to them. The model forms {{the basis of the}} service to provide grid magnetic angle to the UK mapping agency for publication on their map products. This ensures navigation using their maps and a compass is possible. The usefulness of such ground-based vector magnetic observations around the world for assessing local and global model uncertainties is demonstrated. A global database of observations is maintained and can be accessed at [URL]...|$|E
5000|$|In 1852, the French {{physicist}} LÃ©on Foucault {{discovered that}} a gyro with {{two degrees of freedom}} points north. This principle was adapted by Max Schuler in 1921 to build the first surveying gyro. In 1949, the gyro-theodolite - at that time called a [...] "meridian pointer" [...] or [...] "meridian indicator" [...] - was first used by the Clausthal Mining Academy underground. Several years later it was improved with the addition of autocollimation telescopes. In 1960, the Fennel Kassel company produced the first of the KT1 series of gyro-theodolites. Fennel Kassel and others later produced <b>gyro</b> <b>attachments</b> that can be mounted on normal theodolites.|$|R
