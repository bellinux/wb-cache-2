With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians duly capitulated, <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy.

5000|$|In the {{election}} campaign the parties positions on foreign relations and <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Donbass could be roughly divided into two groups. The first group consisted of pro-European parties that advocated to <b>end</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Donbass by use of force and consisted of Fatherland Party, Civic Position, Radical Party and People's Front (this party was ambiguous about use of force). Svoboda also wanted to <b>end</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Donbass by use of force. The party Petro Poroshenko Bloc was the only pro-European party that wanted to <b>end</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Donbass by a peaceful solution. The second group was Strong Ukraine and Opposition Bloc who were considered pro-Russian and they advocated to <b>end</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Donbass by a peaceful solution. The Communist Party of Ukraine (according to political scientist Tadeusz A. Olszański) [...] "effectively supports the separatist rebellion".|$|R

Kira joins the Archangel and Lacus' faction to fight both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT to stop both sides from destroying each other.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed {{by these}} Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began {{supporting}} Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek peace. The King's Peace, {{also known as}} the Peace of Antalcidas, was signed in 387 BC, <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's hegemonic position in the Greek political system.|$|E
5|$|By December, Etruria {{had been}} moved to Tobruk, where she {{provided}} gunfire support to the Italians defending the city. She was joined there by Etna and twelve torpedo boats. In the meantime, most of the fleet had returned to Italy for refitting. In January 1912, Etruria was moved back to Benghazi. For {{the next six months}} she remained here, supporting the garrison against Ottoman counter-attacks. The ship repeatedly shelled the Ottoman camps outside the city. On 15 October, the Ottomans surrendered, <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lafayette left Boston for France on 18 December 1781. On arrival he {{was welcomed}} as a hero, and on 22 January 1782 he was {{received}} at Versailles.

He was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1782, with no treaty yet signed <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Lafayette helped prepare for a combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies. The Treaty of Paris signed between Great Britain and the U.S. in 1783 made the expedition unnecessary—Lafayette took part in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian held out, making {{another attempt}} to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into {{negotiations}} with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to {{the remainder of the}} Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521–26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.|$|E

Despite the renewal of military action, the Congress continued its meetings in Rastatt until the assassination of the French delegation in April 1799.|$|E

Among the group who accepted the offer, Peeler was one of ten who embarked for Melbourne aboard HMAT Medic on 24 August, arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later. He would not return to France; on 11 November 1918 an armistice with Germany was declared, effectively <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December.|$|E

Soon Shevraeth openly opposes King Galdran, and accompanies the Astiars to fight the royal forces. They kill Galdran, <b>ending</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and creating opportunity {{for a change in}} power in Remalna.
