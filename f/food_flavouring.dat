40|$|Quality of {{food can}} be divided into sensory and hidden quality, In the sensory area there is {{appearance}}, texture and flavour. Of these characteristics, appearance is the most important at point of purchase. This is followed by texture and then by flavour, i. e. aroma and taste when the food is consumed (Kramer, 1973). While it has been established that taste is “four dimensional”, aroma is much more complex and has many dimensions. The importance of aroma in fruit and vegetables in relation to consumer acceptability is a matter of debate. For example, {{there is no doubt that}} with onions aroma is important, as it is with certain apple cultivars and in wine and fruit juices. It can be countered that aroma of many foods is only of major importance to a flavourists who wishes to blend chemical compounds to produce a flavour and is of secondary importance to a consumer who may buy on price, appearance and texture. Kazeniac (1977) has pointed out that an important criterion for the success of a <b>food</b> <b>flavour</b> appears to be recognition and compatability of the <b>flavour</b> of the <b>food</b> with <b>flavours</b> familiars to the consumer. The increased interest in home-grown foods offers evidence of changing habits towards natural <b>food</b> <b>flavours,</b> In the UK there are signs that the domestic purchaser is selecting fruit on sensory properties (Williams and Knee, 1977) especially Cox’s Orange Pippin apples. However, the position with Golden Delicious is different and both Belgian, British and Irish consumers seem to buy on the basis of colour (Monin, 1974; Centre Francais du Commerce Exterieur, 1975; Gormley and Egan, 1977). This paper reviews some of the work on the identification of aroma compounds in fruit and vegetables, gives an account of aroma related studies at Kinsealy Research Centre and touches on other aspects of aroma including off-flavours and aroma in processed foods...|$|R

5000|$|Hops are {{the female}} flower {{clusters}} or seed cones of the hop vine Humulus lupulus, {{which are used}} as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. [...] Hops had been used for medicinal and <b>food</b> <b>flavouring</b> purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in Carolingian monasteries {{in what is now}} Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn't until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as yarrow, wild rosemary, and bog myrtle, and other ingredients such as juniper berries, aniseed and ginger, which would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as Fraoch by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E

40|$|Our {{experience}} of flavour involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, and the hedonic evaluation of this complex flavour experience {{is important in}} determination of food choice. The appearance of food also generates expectations about <b>food</b> <b>flavour,</b> and past work suggests that these expectations if confirmed enhance the flavour experience. What is less clear {{is what happens when}} cues prior to ingestion predict a flavour which is in marked contrast to the actual flavour characteristics. To test this, we conducted three experiments where expectations about <b>food</b> <b>flavour</b> were generated by plausible but inaccurate food labels for a highly novel food, smoked-salmon ice-cream. In Experiment 1, the {{experience of}} the food in the mouth generated strong dislike when labelled as ice-cream, but acceptance when labelled as frozen savoury mousse. Labelling the food as ice-cream also resulted in stronger ratings of how salty and savoury the food was than when labelled as a savoury food. Experiment 2 confirmed these findings, and also found that an uninformative label also resulted in acceptable liking ratings. Experiment 3 explicitly tested the effect of labels on flavour expectation, and confirmed that the ice-cream label generated strong expectations of a sweet, fruity flavour, consistent with the visual appearance of the ice-cream, but in marked contrast to the flavour of salty fish. As in Experiments 1 and 2, liking was minimal when the food was tasted after the ice-cream label condition, but liking was acceptable in the other label conditions. These data show that the contrast between expected and actual sensory qualities can result in a strong negative affective response and enhancement of the unexpected sensory qualities...|$|R
40|$|As in many sweet <b>foods,</b> <b>flavour</b> is an {{essential}} characteristic of cocoa and chocolate. The compounds responsible for the aroma are methylpyrazines, nitrogen heterocyclic substances formed during the roasting process. Among these compounds, 2 -methylpyrazine and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethylpyrazine {{are the most important}} compounds because they are both responsible for the respective sweet and strong cocoa aroma. They can represent a useful index for the assessment of product and process qualities. The aim of this work is to set-up and optimize the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) analytical method, in order to determine flavour compositions and, at the same time, perform a predictive analysis of the aroma content of different cocoa blends. Results show a statistical correlation between pyrazine content, geographical origin and sensory properties...|$|R
