5|$|Every new Queen's Counsel created {{reduced the}} Serjeants in importance, since {{even the most}} junior QC took {{precedence}} over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.|$|E
5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E

5|$|German Georg Hackl won {{a silver}} in the singles luge, {{becoming}} the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics. Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men's and women's ice hockey gold medals. Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved the judging of the pairs figure skating competition. The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal. The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. The judging broke along Cold War lines with judges from former Communist countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from Western nations voting for the Canadians. The only exception was the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed {{that she had been}} pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition. The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games. Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1,000metre short-track speed skating event.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E

5000|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{established}} a third trial chamber at the ICTY {{and decided that}} three additional <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> be elected {{as soon as possible}} to serve in the new chamber. A list of nominations of between six and nine <b>judges</b> <b>would</b> be established. Finally, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to make arrangements to enhance the effective functioning of the ICTY.|$|R

25|$|Blavatsky often {{referred}} to {{the founding of the}} Theosophical Society as coming about as a result of occult direction from her teachers. <b>Judge</b> <b>would</b> later write that the objects of the Society had been given to Olcott by the Masters before the meeting at which they were adopted. Thus, the founding of the Theosophy Society may be seen to have been inspired.|$|E
25|$|In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), {{counsel for}} the {{applicants}} alleged that the judge was guilty of actual bias and requested that she recuse herself. The judge rejected the application as she found the supporting grounds flimsy, and felt that a fair-minded and reasonable observer would hardly conclude {{that she would not}} be able to make an objective and impartial decision of the matters placed before her as another <b>judge</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, where {{conviction}} {{rates for}} criminal offences are high, an acquittal {{is akin to}} the judiciary rejecting the executive's stand regarding a party’s guilt. Although {{it has been suggested}} that the low acquittal rate is evidence of a lack of judicial independence, it is also consistent with a stringent prosecution process that takes action only against persons who are manifestly guilty, such that even the most fair and independent-minded <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> decide to convict.|$|E

25|$|The {{lower courts}} had to revisit Booker's {{sentencing}} {{in light of}} the Supreme Court decision. Booker was re-sentenced by the same judge to the same 30-year sentence he originally received (longer than the 21-year sentence the <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> have been able to impose had the guidelines not been made advisory); however, retroactive changes in crack cocaine guidelines meant Booker's sentence has been reduced slightly by a federal judge (from 30 to 27 years) and he has a projected release date of 20 June 2024.|$|E
25|$|Weller {{accepted}} {{money from}} two convicted associates of former congressman Duke Cunningham. Weller's spokesman {{said that the}} donations probably originated from his support of {{the research and development}} tax credit and the money was donated to a charity in Oregon. Weller and 11 other congressmen were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Brent R. Wilkes, the contractor accused of bribing Cunningham. The subpoenas were withdrawn by defense attorneys on October 3, 2007 when it became apparent the trial <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> quash them anyway. Weller and the other 11 did not testify in the trial.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{the test}} to Washington's case, the Court {{concluded}} that counsel {{did not perform}} deficiently and that Washington suffered no prejudice. The counsel's decision to focus on remorse and emotional distress was a reasonable strategic decision {{in light of the}} trial judge's stated views on remorse, the heinousness of Washington's crimes, and Washington's own statements to counsel. In view of those considerations, the Court could not conclude that additional mitigating evidence would have given rise to a reasonable probability that the trial <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> have sentenced Washington to life in prison rather than death.|$|E

25|$|At the prosecution's request, {{the judge}} issued {{a gag order}} forbidding the {{following}} parties {{to talk to the}} news media: the defendant, the prosecutor, defense counsel, any attorney working in their offices, their agents, staff, experts, any judicial officer or court employee, any law enforcement employee, and any agency involved in the case or any persons subpoenaed or expected to testify. The purpose was to prevent people among whom a jury would be selected from being influenced. However, the <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> consider proposals to allow either side to answer reporters' questions about rumors surrounding the case.|$|E
25|$|Several {{politicians}} {{petitioned the}} courts {{after the first}} program was aired. Deputy Elisa Carrió filed a case with judge Julián Ercolini, who was already investigating Lázaro Báez for conspiracy. Ercolini gave Carrió's case to a Kirchner supporter, judge Sebastián Casanello. Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan began an investigation; attorney Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten filed a similar case against Lázaro Báez, his sons Martín Báez and Leandro Báez, Daniel Pérez Gadín and Fabián Rossi after Carrio's, but before her case was given to Casanello. The prosecutor was Miguel Ángel Osorio. Attorney Ricardo Monner Sans and deputies Manuel Garrido and Graciela Ocaña filed additional cases. Since the cases were similar, President of the Federal Chamber Martín Irurzun had to decide which <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> preside. Canicoba Corral rejected the case {{and sent it to}} Casanello, who sent it to the Federal Chamber; Casanello was finally confirmed as judge.|$|E
25|$|The {{court was}} set up like a magistrate's court, with a {{barrister}} presiding as a judge and another barrister acting as a permanent prosecutor. The <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> hold temporary military rank, and would normally act as the sole decider of both fact and sentence; if the potential sentence was more than two years, up to five other officers would also sit as judges. The defendant could be represented by any legal counsel, British or German, and the court could work in both the English and German languages. The court heard 4,295 cases between 1919 and 1925, with possible sentences for minor offences including fines and prison sentences of between seven and fourteen days, normally served in a standard German prison. Most cases were about possessing weapons illegally, straying onto British property, occupying carriages in trains reserved for British officers, reckless driving and possessing British Government property. The courts were well attended by German civilians, and German lawyers also attended to make a study of British legal procedure.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} {{files in}} a case calculated {{to lead to a}} judgment, the judges would exchange their views informally on the salient legal points of the case, and a time limit for producing a judgment would then be set. Then, each <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> write an anonymous summary containing his opinion; the opinions would be circulated among the Court for 2 or 3 days before the President drafted a judgment containing a summary of those submitted by individual judges. The Court would then agree on the decision that they wished to reach, along with the main points of argument they wished to use. Once this was done, a Committee of 4, including the President, the Registrar and two judges elected by secret ballot, drafted a final judgment, which was then voted on by the entire Court. Once a final judgment was set, it was given to the public and the press. Every judgment contained the reasons behind the decision and the judges assenting; dissenting judges were allowed to deliver their own judgment, with all judgments read in open court before the agents of the parties to the dispute. Judgments could not be revised except on the discovery of some fact unknown when the Court sat but not if the fact was known but not discussed because of negligence.|$|E
500|$|Smith officially {{declared}} a republic on 2 March 1970, and on 10 April the RF was decisively returned {{to power in}} the first republican election, winning all 50 white seats {{out of a total}} of 66. Six days later, Dupont was sworn in as the first President of Rhodesia. British officials learned only from the Rhodesian radio that Dupont's oath of office was administered not by Beadle but by the [...] "Acting Chief Justice", Hector Macdonald. Beadle's absence prompted speculation in British quarters, but this promptly dissipated after The Rhodesia Herald reported on 29 April that a High Court farewell to Sir Vincent Quenet, a retiring <b>judge,</b> <b>would</b> be presided over by the republic's Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle.|$|E
500|$|Only Serjeants-at-Law {{could become}} judges {{of the common}} law courts; this rule came into being in the 14th century for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, and was {{extended}} to the Exchequer of Pleas in the 16th century; it {{did not apply to}} the Court of Chancery, a court of equity, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. The Serjeants-at-Law also had social privileges; they ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath, and their wives had the right to be addressed as [...] "Lady —", {{in the same way as}} the wives of knights or baronets. A Serjeant made a King's Counsel or <b>judge</b> <b>would</b> still retain these social privileges. As the cream of the legal profession, Serjeants earned higher fees than normal barristers.|$|E
