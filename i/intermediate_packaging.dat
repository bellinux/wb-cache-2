The {{loading of}} whole set supply {{materials}} with multi-constraints is complicated and difficult, {{and it has}} a broad application prospect in the field of packaging, transportation and storage. In order to improve the container’s space using rate of the whole set supply materials, an approach is put forward by means of <b>intermediate</b> <b>packaging,</b> spatial subdivision, spatial merge and mantissa rounding while container’s shape and size as the constraints.

40|$|Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) {{replicate}} by {{reverse transcription}} of an RNA <b>intermediate.</b> <b>Packaging</b> of this RNA pregenome into nucleocapsids and replication initiation depend crucially on {{the interaction of}} the reverse transcriptase, P protein, with the cis-acting, 5 ' end-proximal encapsidation signal epsilon. The overall secondary structure is similar in all of the hepadnaviral epsilon signals, with a lower and an upper stem, separated by a bulge, and an apical loop. However, while epsilon is almost perfectly conserved in all mammalian viruses, the epsilon signals of duck HBV (DHBV) and heron HBV (D epsilon and H epsilon, respectively) differ substantially in their upper stem regions, both in primary sequence and in secondary structure; nonetheless, H epsilon interacts productively with DHBV P protein, as shown by its ability to stimulate priming, i. e., the covalent attachment of a deoxynucleoside monophosphate to the protein. In this study, we extensively mutated the variable and the conserved positions in the upper stem of D epsilon and correlated the functional activities of the variant RNAs in a priming assay with secondary structure and physical P protein binding. These data revealed a proper overall structure, with the bulge and certain key residues, e. g., in the loop, being important constraints in protein binding. Many mutations at the evolutionarily variable positions complied with these criteria and yielded priming-competent RNAs. However, most mutants at the conserved positions outside the loop were defective in priming even though they had epsilon-like structures and bound to P protein; conversely, one point mutant in the loop with an apical structure different from those of D epsilon and H epsilon was priming competent. These results suggest that P protein binding can induce differently structured epsilon RNAs to adopt a new, common conformation, and they support an induced-fit model of the epsilon-P interaction in which both components undergo extensive structural alterations during formation of a priming-competent ribonucleoprotein complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the container closure system on the stability of an atropine sulfate solution was studied. Therefore a model-solution was filled into different container closure systems {{similar to those used}} by the German armed forces as autoinjectors against nerve agent poisoning. These containers were stored at 40, 50 and 60 °C for up to twelve months. Samples were removed from the stock and analysed after 1, 3, 5, and 12 months. Data obtained were used to calculate the maximum shelf life of atropine solution stored at ambient temperature in the three reviewed container closures. For the analysis of assay and degradation products a new rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) method was established. So the analysis time could be shortened to a fifth, from 45 to ten minutes, which makes it a time and solvent saving method. Differences concerning stability of atropine solutions stored in glass, plastic or steel were found. Regarding the shelf life of storing at ambient temperature atropine proofed to be more stable in metal- then in glass- or plastic-cartridges. By testing siliconized as well as not siliconized metal-cartridges, it could be demonstrated that the silicone film also improved drug stability. No {{influence of}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>packaging</b> material could be detected concerning formation of degradation products. There is no evidence of formation of other degradation products than tropic acid and apoatropine. Great differences were noticed concerning the leachables found in the atropine solution. For example the migration of phenol from the rubber stoppers of the metal-cartridge is much more distinct than from the rubber stopper of the glass-cartridge. The stoppers of the plastic-cartridge, in contrary, do not release phenol. In addition, different amounts of the preservatives from the silicone emulsion used for passivation of the cartridges can be detected in the atropine solutions. But in general there can be found only traces of them. By storing the components of the container closure systems in a citrate buffer which is like that used for the atropine solution it was confirmed that those parts that had been heated after siliconization do not release constituents of the silicone emulsion to the buffer solution. Besides those leachables, other signals can be detected in the HPLC chromatograms of the tested solutions that could not be identified yet. Their presence depends on the duration of storage, the storage temperature and on the container closure. Presumably, these signals are caused by leachables from the packaging material but they still have to be identified during further analyses...|$|E

40|$|Transportation of low {{molecular}} weight cargoes into the plant vacuole represents an essential plant cell function. Several lines of evidence indicate that autophagy-related direct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to vacuole (and also, apoplast) transport plays here a more general role than expected. This route is regulated by autophagy proteins, including recently discovered involvement of the exocyst subcomplex. Traffic from ER into the vacuole bypassing Golgi apparatus (GA) acts not only in stress-related cytoplasm recycling or detoxification, but also in developmentally-regulated biopolymer and secondary metabolite import into the vacuole (or apoplast), exemplified by storage proteins and anthocyanins. We propose that this pathway is relevant also for some phytohormones’ (e. g., auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA)) degradation. We hypothesize that SA {{is not only an}} autophagy inducer, but also a cargo for autophagy-related ER to vacuole membrane container delivery and catabolism. ER membrane localized enzymes will potentially enhance the area of biosynthetic reactive surfaces, and also, abundant ER localized membrane importers (e. g., ABC transporters) will internalize specific molecular species into the autophagosome biogenesis domain of ER. Such active ER domains may create tubular invaginations of tonoplast into the vacuoles as import <b>intermediates.</b> <b>Packaging</b> of cargos into the ER-derived autophagosome-like containers might be an important mechanism of vacuole and exosome biogenesis and cytoplasm protection against toxic metabolites.

40|$|Emerging I/O {{density and}} {{bandwidth}} requirements are driving packages to low-CTE silicon, glass and organic substrates for higher wiring density {{and reliability of}} interconnections and Cu-low k dielectrics. These are needed for high performance applications as 2. 5 D packages in large-size, and also as ultra-thin packages for consumer applications that are directly assembled on the board {{without the need for}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>package.</b> The trend to low-CTE packages (CTE of 3 - 8 ppm/°C), however, creates large CTE mismatch with the board on which they are assembled. Interconnection reliability is, therefore, a major concern when low CTE interposers are surface mounted onto organic system boards via solder joints. This reliability concern is further aggravated with large package sizes and finer pitch. For wide acceptance of low CTE packages in high volume production, it is also critical to assemble them on board using standard Surface Mount Technologies (SMT) without the need for under-fill. This research aims to demonstrate reliable 400 micron pitch solder interconnections from low CTE glass interposers directly assembled onto organic boards by overcoming the above challenges using two approaches; 1) Stress-relief dielectric build up layers {{on the back of the}} interposer, 2) Polymer collar around the solder bumps for shear stress re-distribution. A comprehensive methodology based on modeling, design, test vehicle fabrication and characterization is employed to study and demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in meeting the interposer-to-board interconnection requirements.

Three types of head-related structures can be distinguished: (i) empty heads (petit lambda), less angular in outline than complete lambda heads; (ii) heads partially filled with DNA (partially filled heads), having a roundish outline; and (iii) particles tightly packed with DNA (full heads), having a hexagonal outline. DNA-head complexes were bound either at the terminal end of a DNA thread or at a point intermediate along the thread. The terminal complexes were more abundant. No head-related structures could be found in an induced lambda mutant lysogen blocked in the synthesis of petit lambda (amber in lambda gene E).

40|$|Recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) viral vectors hold great {{therapeutic}} {{potential for}} human diseases. However, {{a relatively small}} packaging capacity (less than 5 kb) has limited the application of rAAV for certain diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here we compared two mechanistically distinct approaches to overcome packaging restraints with rAAV vectors. The trans-splicing approach reconstitutes gene expression from two independent rAAV vectors, each encoding unique, nonoverlapping halves of a transgene. This process requires intermolecular concatamerization and subsequent splicing between independent vectors. A distinct overlapping vector approach uses homologous recombination between overlapping regions in two independent vectors. Using the �-galactosidase gene as template, trans-splicing approaches were threefold (in primary fibroblasts) and 12 -fold (in muscle tissue) more effective in generating full-length transgene products than the overlapping vector approach. Nevertheless, the efficiency of trans-splicing remained moderate at approximately 4. 3 % (for muscle) and 7 % (for fibroblasts) of that seen with a single vector encoding the full-length transgene. The efficiency of trans-splicing was augmented 185 -fold by adenoviral E 4, but not E 2 a, gene products. This augmentation was much less pronounced with the overlapping vectoring approach (12 -fold).

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the effects of a nurse led intermediate care programme in patients who have been hospitalised with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Community and hospital care in west London. Participants: 122 patients with COPD. Intervention: A care package incorporating initial pulmonary rehabilitation and self-management education, provision of a written, personalised COPD action plan, monthly telephone calls and 3 monthly home visits by a specialist nurse for a period of 2 years. Main outcome measure: Hospital readmission rate. Secondary outcomes: Unscheduled primary care consultations and quality of life. Results: There were no differences in hospital admission rates or in exacerbation rates between the two groups. Self-management of exacerbations was significantly different and the intervention group {{were more likely to be}} treated with oral steroids alone or oral steroids and antibiotics, and the initiators of treatment for exacerbations were statistically more likely to be the patients themselves. 12 patients in the control group died during the 2 year period, eight as a result of COPD, compared with six patients in the intervention group, of whom one died from COPD. This is a significant difference. When the numbers were adjusted to reflect the numbers still alive at 2 years, in the intervention group patients reported a total of 171 unscheduled contacts with their general practitioner (GP) and in the control group, 280 contacts. The number needed to treat was 0. 558 —ie, for every one COPD patient receiving the intervention and self-management advice, there were 1. 79 fewer unscheduled contacts with the GP. Conclusions: An <b>intermediate</b> care <b>package</b> incorporating pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management education and the receipt of a written COPD action plan, together with regular nurse contact, is associated with a reduced need for unscheduled primary care consultations and a reduction in deaths due to COPD but did not affect the hospital readmission rate. </p...|$|R

The article studies the shelf life of semi-finished products made from carp, treated with different modes of low-temperature thermo - humid cooking with the use of vacuum packaging. The authors found that during storage all samples carp decrease the mass fraction of the amino acids, and as a result, the mass fraction of the total protein in the samples. However, in the packaged samples treated with humidified coolant decrease the mass fraction of amino acids occurs less rapidly, indicating a better preservation of the amino acid content in the samples and hence maintaining bioavailability <b>intermediates.</b> Provisional vacuum <b>packaging</b> increases duration of the retention period...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{economic}} {{and population growth}} recently drives Maputo to become more metropolitan, with construction sector {{as one of the}} pillars to support its transformation. This progressive move is, however, hindered by one of the most crucial problems: water scarcity. Water is essentially required by construction sector, especially in concrete production. It needs a proper quantity and quality to meet the expected strength. While the quantity is determined by its ratio with cement, the quality varies for plain, structural and high-strength concrete. Drinking or tap water is commonly used in Maputo but previous experiments worldwide show that there is a possibility to use non-drinking water for concrete production. One of the emerging alternatives is treated sewage. This thesis aims to assess whether reclaimed water from the sewage {{can be used as a}} source for concrete production in Maputo in order to save tap water for domestic purposes. To determine water demand from the concrete companies, 156 concrete companies in Maputo and its surrounding, Matola and Machava, were listed and 11 of them were interviewed with the variance of locations, types of products, production methods, existing water source, number of employees, monthly water tariff, current practices and willingness to cooperate for a preliminary water reclamation project. The average amount of water consumption for 11 interviewed companies is 311 ± 36 m 3 /day and for the actual population of 156 companies is 4411 ± 257 m 3 /day. This value contributes to 12 % - 14 % from the total tap water use in Maputo. The water price is approximately € 0. 76 /m 3 for the small companies and € 0. 38 /m 3 for both the medium and large companies. The potential supply sources were investigated from different types, flow rates and locations, such as the outlet endpoints from houses, the wastewater treatment plant and the effluent from other industries. The influent of the wastewater treatment plant was considered the best source for the preliminary plant design with a flow rate of 5682 ± 1196 m 3 /day. Available standards worldwide and previous works were studied to find the safe ranges of water quality for concrete. Field and laboratory measurements were also conducted to provide preliminary information. The results were used as the basis for designing a treatment plant from the demand of 11 interviewed companies, with lower effluent quality than tap water, yet sufficient for concrete production. Recommendations of a large scale plant for all 156 companies were also presented. The system is designed as a modular scheme to provide different effluent qualities and potential changes, such as the increase of the influent flow rate, the option of combining the new system with the existing plant, etc. The system is divided into four phases. Phase 1, consisting of a coagulation tank (1 x 0. 6 x 0. 5 m), four flocculation tank (1. 5 x 1 x 1 m) and a dissolved air flotation tank (1. 6 x 1. 4 x 1 m), removes fat, oil and grease, phosphorus and suspended solids. Phase 2 removes remaining suspended solids by a rapid sand filtration (1. 50 m bed depth x 0. 56 m diameter x 5. 45 m height). Phase 3, comprising nine units of nanofiltration in one skid, removes dissolved solids to meet the demand of higher strength concrete. The last phase is disinfection which were excluded since the removal capacities from the previous phases are already sufficient. The cost of the design is divided into three packages depending on the expected effluent quality from each company. The basic package only consists of phase 1 and costs € 0. 30 /m 3. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>package,</b> comprising phase 1 and 2, costs € 0. 40 /m 3. The advanced package, consisting of phase 1 and 3, costs € 0. 80 /m 3. Only the price of the advanced package is higher than the actual tap water price. Pumps are installed before the units of rapid sand filtration and nanofiltration. Valves are incorporated to divide the flow for different treatment packages. The delivery of the effluent is performed by renting trucks since it is less expensive than constructing new pipelines. The design shows that producing concrete with reclaimed water from treated sewage is possible to be performed in Maputo and the sewage does not need to reach drinking water quality. It is the starting point to increase the availability of usable water and the opportunity of supplying tap water as much as possible for domestic purposes.

40|$|Icosahedral viruses exhibit elegant {{pathways}} of capsid {{assembly and}} maturation regulated by symmetry principles. Assembly {{is a dynamic}} process driven by consecutive and genetically programmed morphogenetic interactions between protein subunits. The non-symmetric capsid subunits are gathered by hydrophobic contacts and non-covalent interactions in assembly intermediates, which serve as blocks to build a symmetric capsid. In some cases, non-symmetric interactions among intermediates are involved in assembly, highlighting the remarkable capacity of capsid proteins to fold into demanding conformations compatible with a closed protein shell. In this chapter, the morphogenesis of structurally simple icosahedral viruses, including representative members of the parvoviruses, picornaviruses or polyomaviruses as paradigms, is described in some detail. Icosahedral virus assembly may occur in different subcellular compartments and involve a panoplia of cellular and viral factors, chaperones, and protein modifications that, in general, are still poorly characterized. Mechanisms of viral genome encapsidation may imply direct interactions between the genome and the assembly <b>intermediates,</b> or active <b>packaging</b> into a preformed empty capsid. High stability of intermediates and proteolytic cleavages during viral maturation usually contribute to the overall irreversible character of the assembly process. These and other simple icosahedral viruses were pioneer models to understand basic principles of virus assembly, continue to be leading subjects of morphogenetic analyses, and have inspired ongoing studies on the assembly of larger viruses and cellular and synthetic macromolecular complexes.

40|$|To detect {{changes in}} capsid {{structure}} that occur when a preassembled bacteriophage T 7 capsid both packages and cleaves to mature-size longer (concatameric) DNA, the kinetics and thermodynamics are determined {{here for the}} binding of the protein-specific probe, 1, 1 '-bi(4 -anilino) naphthalene- 5, 5 '-di-sulfonic acid (bis-ANS), to bacteriophage T 7, a T 7 DNA deletion (8. 4 %) mutant, and a DNA-free T 7 capsid (metrizamide low density capsid II) {{known to be a}} DNA <b>packaging</b> <b>intermediate</b> that has a permeability barrier not present in a related capsid (metrizamide high density capsid II). Initially, some binding to either bacteriophage or metrizamide low density capsid II occurs too rapidly to quantify (phase 1, duration < 10 s). Subsequent binding (phase 2) occurs with first-order kinetics. Only the phase 1 binding occurs for metrizamide high density capsid II. These observations, together with both the kinetics of the quenching by ethidium of bound bis-ANS fluorescence and the nature of bis-ANS-induced protein alterations, are explained by the hypothesis that the phase 2 binding occurs at internal sites. The number of these internal sites increases as the density of the packaged DNA decreases. The accompanying change in structure is potentially the signal for initiating cleavage of a concatemer. Evidence for the following was also obtained: (a) a previously undetected packaging-associated change in the conformation of the major protein of the outer capsid shell and (b) partitioning by a permeability barrier of the interior of the T 7 capsid...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiplication}} of bacteriophage T 7 {{is blocked}} in Escherichia coli M. The genetic determinant of this ability (groM) to inhibit T 7 growth {{was transferred to}} an E. coli K- 12 recipient by means of conjugation. We determined at which precise step T 7 maturation is blocked. Phage-directed protein and DNA synthesis as well as degradation of host DNA were not qualitatively affected. Instead of infective phages, only preheads were produced. These, however, were maturable in vitro. The newly synthesized phage DNA accumulated in a concatemeric form and matured from its tetrameric or longer forms (very fast sedimenting DNA) only into its dimeric form (fast-sedimenting DNA) or longer forms. The following step, i. e., the maturation of the dimeric to unit-length DNA, was not observed. Since the concatemeric form of T 7 DNA accumulated {{in spite of the}} presence of maturable preheads, {{it is likely that the}} maturation process was blocked at the level of DNA <b>packaging.</b> As <b>intermediates</b> in the <b>packaging</b> process, we found some prehead-DNA complexes. We interpreted these as true assembly intermediates (or breakdown products thereof), since the attached DNA was still in its concatemeric form. This shows that the very first DNA packaging step, the binding of the progeny DNA to the preheads, was obviously not blocked. Rather, a later step, such as the filling of the preheads with T 7 DNA or the stabilization of completely packaged particles (i. e., the final cutting of the concatemers into unit-size length), was inhibited...|$|R

The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the shelf life of turkey meat from different colour categories (light (PSE-like), <b>intermediate</b> and dark), <b>packaged</b> under aerobic or modified atmosphere (MAP) conditions; also to establish a relationship between microbial quality and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), evaluating its capacity for shelf life determination. Breasts were selected according to Luminance (L*) and pH 24 : L ≥ 51 and pH 5. 8 for dark colour. Sliced meat was packaged under aerobic or MAP conditions with 50 % N 2 and 50 % CO 2, then stored in the dark at 0 ± 1 şC for periods during 12 or 25 days. Meat under aerobic conditions was evaluated for microbiological characteristics and TVB-N on days 0, 5 and 12. This evaluation was extended to include days 19 and 25 when samples were under MAP. 2. Dark meat group after 12 days of storage in aerobiosis presented significantly higher plate counts of aerobic mesophilic, psychrotrophic microorganisms and higher TVB-N than other meat colour categories. The shelf life of turkey meat under MAP was one week longer for intermediate and light colour meat (20 days) than for dark meat. TVB-N values of 20 - 30 mg NH 3 / 100 g turkey meat correspond to advanced spoilage stages. 14 mg NH 3 / 100 g was proposed as the limit of freshness acceptability for turkey meat. 3. TVB-N was an indicator of turkey meat microbial spoilage but was not a suitable early predictor for microbial spoilage and in particular for turkey meat stored under MAP because counts of microorganisms were moderately correlated (Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae) with this index, as they were inhibited by MAP gas mixture and storage temperature {{used in the present}} study...|$|R
40|$|With {{regard to}} {{efficiency}} {{in the design}} and manufacturing of structural elements it was found that understanding constitutive material laws is essential to civil engineers. When modelling engineering materials engineers face the task of making various assumptions including the choice of a material law applicable to their need. Furthermore, {{it should be noted that}} these assumptions affect the accuracy of constitutive material constants which not only influence the purpose for which said material could be used but in addition the economic value of the said material. The use of Finite Element software could be employed and was found to be an important tool in reproducing environmentally accurate constitutive behaviour. This kind of software discretises a material specimen into finite elements in order to monitor different forms of constitutive behaviour. Moreover, the accuracy of this virtual environment is directly proportional to the amount of discretised elements a material is comprised of. This research project aims to provide sufficient preliminary literature to cement the fact that computational methods should be used as reference in computing non-linear constitutive material parameters. This hypothesis is primarily based on the fact that numerous literature, which could be found in section 2, all come to the same conclusion. That is, as the complexity of a constitutive material law increases so does the time it takes to compute a solution from said law. This literature aims to identify methods that could be employed to minimize the simulation time of computing material constants from non-linear constitutive laws. The distinctiveness of using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based (POD) software ORION is that it reduces the complexity of a large dataset. It does so by using linear algebraic operations, namely Eigen vectors and their associated Eigenvalues, to project said dataset to a lower order solution space. In this lower order solution space ORION employs an interpolation technique in order to compute effective constitutive material constants. With regard to computational time, it should be noted that ORION could reduce simulation time greatly. Furthermore, this work provides an outline of the hyperelastic and elastoplastic constitutive material laws and their respective constitutive models. The aforementioned material laws have been implemented within the framework of SESKA, Mesh free in-house software developed by Doctor Sebastian Skatulla, to analyse simple geometric layouts. Moreover, the author provides numerical examples in order to analyse these materials using in-house POD-based and SESKA software packages respectively. Finally, this document provides the relevant preliminary conclusions with regard to the use of POD-based software and its effect on the simulation time of a non-linear constitutive material law. In contrast with coupling the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm directly with the SESKA software package, the work in this research project is unique as it uses POD-based software as an <b>intermediate</b> software <b>package</b> in order to decrease computational simulation time...|$|R
40|$|At {{least seven}} viral genes encode {{proteins}} (UL 6, UL 15, UL 17, UL 25, UL 28, UL 32, and UL 33) {{that are required}} for DNA cleavage and packaging of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA. Sequence analysis reveals that UL 15 shares homology with gp 17, the large catalytic subunit of the bacteriophage T 4 terminase. Thus, UL 15 may play a direct role in the cleavage of viral DNA replication intermediates into monomers. In this study, we asked whether UL 15 and other cleavage and packaging proteins could be detected in capsids isolated from infected cells. Consistent with previous studies showing that UL 6 and UL 25 are minor protein constituents of the capsids, we detected these proteins in both B and C capsids. In contrast, the previously identified full-length version (81 kDa) of UL 15 was found predominantly in B capsids and in much smaller amounts in C capsids. In addition, the UL 28 protein was found predominantly in B but not C capsids in a distribution {{similar to that of}} the 81 -kDa version of UL 15. These results suggest that UL 28 and the 81 -kDa form of UL 15 are transiently associated with capsid <b>intermediates</b> during the <b>packaging</b> process. Surprisingly, however, a previously unidentified 87 -kDa form of UL 15 was found in the B and C capsids and in virions. Analysis of cells infected with mutants individually lacking UL 6, UL 15, UL 25, UL 28, or UL 32 demonstrates that the lack of one cleavage and packaging protein does not affect the expression of the others. Furthermore, this analysis, together with guanidine HCl extraction analysis of purified capsids, indicates that UL 6, UL 25, and UL 28 are able to associate with B capsids in the absence of other DNA cleavage and packaging proteins. On the other hand, the two UL 15 -related proteins (81 and 87 kDa) do not associate efficiently with B capsids in cells infected with UL 6 and UL 28 mutants. These results suggest that the ability of the UL 15 -related proteins to bind to B capsids may be mediated through interactions with UL 6 and UL 28...|$|R
40|$|Transistor scaling, {{driven by}} Moore’s Law, has enabled the {{integration}} of billions of transistors on a single integrated chip (IC); thereby enabling rapid miniaturization of microprocessor devices such as smartphones, servers and personal computers. However, silicon integration following Moore's law is now reaching its limits due to increasing design complexity and cost, bringing {{the need for a}} new "System Scaling" approach for further miniaturization and performance improvements. The System-on-Package (SOP) approach, pioneered by Georgia Tech PRC, relies on co-integration of multiple electronic functions on a package substrate, as opposed to on-chip. Packaging, therefore, becomes key in enabling higher functional densities. An example of this new approach to system design is the recent trend of "split dies" where a large devices is broken down into smaller devices at finer I/O pitches that are interconnected on a substrate using high-density wiring. These advanced package architectures such as 2. 5 D interposer packages now rely on packaging to improve performance and miniaturize the system as a whole. Silicon interposers are particularly attractive in such split-die applications due to their outstanding lithographic capability enabling high-density, high-speed die-to-die interconnections. Such 2. 5 D interposers tend to be fairly large with body sizes exceeding 30 mmx 40 mm, bringing unprecedented board-level reliability challenges due to large mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between silicon and mother boards. These challenges are typically addressed by introducing an additional organic BGA package between interposer and board to accommodate for the CTE mismatch and decrease in pitch. However, this degrades electrical performance with longer interconnection lengths, and adds to the overall cost. Glass has emerged as an alternative substrate technology to overcome the shortcomings of silicon. Glass has been demonstrated to have superior electrical properties than silicon with lower losses and can accommodate high-density wiring owing to micron-scale lithographic design rules. Further, glass can be tailored for a wide CTE range of 3. 3 to 9. 8 ppm/K. This unique property brings design flexibility to address board-level reliability challenges and directly assemble large glass interposer packages to boards without the need for an <b>intermediate</b> organic <b>package.</b> The primary objective of this research is to model, design and demonstrate a large, 2. 5 D glass BGA package with 1) direct SMT-to-board interconnection; and 2) balanced chip- and- board-level reliability. The ultimate goal is to provide guidelines for the design of 2. 5 D glass BGA packages, optimizing the glass CTE to mitigate warpage and achieve system-level reliability, and subsequently the assembly process and sequence. Finite-element models were built to assess the reliability of 2. 5 D glass packages with direct SMT assembly to the board. The methodology for achieving balanced chip- and- board-level reliability was validated through focused modeling and experimental results for a single-chip package. Board-level reliability was recognized as the most critical challenge and enhanced by using innovative doped solder materials such as Indium’s Mn-doped SACmTM alloy and strain-relief mechanisms to give more design flexibility. Failure distribution analysis and optical characterization was performed to evaluate thermal cycling reliability. A process design approach was demonstrated for mitigating warpage induced by thermocompression bonding on ultra-thin, low- and- high-CTE substrates at I/O pitches below 50 µm. By selecting optimum thermal profiles for mitigating chip-level assembly warpage, board-level assembly is enabled at larger package sizes, and system-level reliability is thereby enhanced. M.

40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{transcription}} factors (TFs) {{involved in}} a biological process {{is the first step}} towards {{a better understanding of the}} underlying regulatory mechanisms. However, due to the involvement of a large number of genes and complicated interactions in a gene regulatory network (GRN), identification of the TFs {{involved in a}} biology process remains to be very challenging. In reality, the recognition of TFs for a given a biological process can be further complicated by the fact that most eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of TFs, which are organized in gene families of various sizes and in many cases with poor sequence conservation except for small conserved domains. This poses a significant challenge for identification of the exact TFs involved or ranking the importance of a set of TFs to a process of interest. Therefore, new methods for recognizing novel TFs are desperately needed. Although a plethora of methods have been developed to infer regulatory genes using microarray data, it is still rare to find the methods that use existing knowledge base in particular the validated genes known to be involved in a process to bait/guide discovery of novel TFs. Such methods can replace the sometimes-arbitrary process of selection of candidate genes for experimental validation and significantly advance our knowledge and understanding of the regulation of a process. Results We developed an automated software package called TF-finder for recognizing TFs involved in a biological process using microarray data and existing knowledge base. TF-finder contains two components, adaptive sparse canonical correlation analysis (ASCCA) and enrichment test, for TF recognition. ASCCA uses positive target genes to bait TFS from gene expression data while enrichment test examines the presence of positive TFs in the outcomes from ASCCA. Using microarray data from salt and water stress experiments, we showed TF-finder is very efficient in recognizing many important TFs involved in salt and drought tolerance as evidenced by the rediscovery of those TFs that have been experimentally validated. The efficiency of TF-finder in recognizing novel TFs was further confirmed by a thorough comparison with a method called Intersection of Coexpression (ICE). Conclusions TF-finder can be successfully used to infer novel TFs involved a biological process of interest using publicly available gene expression data and known positive genes from existing knowledge bases. The package for TF-finder includes an R script for ASCCA, a Perl controller, and several Perl scripts for parsing <b>intermediate</b> outputs. The <b>package</b> is available upon request (hairong@mtu. edu). The R code for standalone ASCCA is also available. </p...|$|R
