50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>wood</b> is {{wood that}} has been {{recently}} cut and therefore has not {{had an opportunity to}} season (dry) by evaporation of the internal moisture. <b>Green</b> <b>wood</b> contains more moisture than seasoned wood, which has been dried through passage of time or by forced drying in kilns. <b>Green</b> <b>wood</b> is considered to have 100% moisture content relative to air-dried or seasoned wood which is considered to be 20%. Energy density charts for wood fuels tend to use air-dried wood as their reference, thus oven-dried or 0% moisture content can reflect 103.4% energy content.|$|R

40|$|During the radial {{growth of}} trees, {{internal}} stresses are created because of wood-cell maturation. Biomechanical models can compute these stresses, {{but they are}} currently limited {{by a lack of}} knowledge about the viscoelastic behavior of <b>green</b> <b>wood.</b> The aim of the present paper is to study the viscoelastic behavior of <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> and to obtain measurements of viscoelastic parameters. In order to accomplish this, the effect of internal maturation stresses on the studied samples was first eliminated by studying viscoelastic phenomena. Creep tests were then performed on small slats of wood using a cantilever bending test. It is shown that <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> viscoelastic behavior can be modeled with Burgers' model. The corresponding parameters are estimated with respect to the wood-cells age. No significant difference between tension wood and normal wood is revealed, but it appears that <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> tends to lose its viscoelastic behavior with maturation...|$|R

Unseasoned (<b>green)</b> <b>wood</b> {{moisture content}} varies by the species; <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> may weigh 70 to 100 percent more than seasoned wood due to water content.
