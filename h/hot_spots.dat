40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>spotting</b> is a {{reliability}} {{problem in}} photovoltaic (PV) panels where a mismatched cell heats up significantly and degrades panel performance. High temperatures due to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> can damage cell encapsulant {{and lead to}} second breakdown; both cause permanent damage to the PV panel.

This paper reexamines the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> problem in PV strings through simulation and load-line analysis. Results show that cells in typical panel string lengths are susceptible to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> because of reverse bias behavior.

40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>spotting</b> is {{a problem}} in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems that reduces panel power performance and accelerates cell degradation. In present day systems, bypass diodes are used to mitigate <b>hot</b> <b>spotting,</b> but it does not prevent <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> or the damage it causes. This paper presents an active <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> detection method to detect <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> within a series of PV cells, using ac parameter characterization. A PV cell is comprised of series and parallel resistances and parallel capacitance, which are affected by voltage bias, illumination, and temperature. Experimental results have shown that when a PV string is under a maximum power point tracking control, <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> in a single cell results in a capacitance increase and dc impedance increase. The capacitance change is detectable by measuring the ac impedance magnitude in the 10 - 70 kHz frequency range. An impedance value change due to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> can be detected by monitoring one high-frequency measurement in the capacitive region and one low-frequency measurement in the dc impedance region. Alternatively, the dc impedance can also be calculated using dc operating point measurements. The proposed <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> detection method can be integrated into a dc-dc power converter that operates at the panel or subpanel level. close 0...|$|R
