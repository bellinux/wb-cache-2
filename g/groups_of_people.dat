50|$|Neohumanism discourages both geosentiment and sociosentiment, {{because both}} {{tend to be}} {{injurious}} to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious.

These localized epidemics typically occur when <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E

Meanwhile, Umar (Oedjang) and Supini (RS Fatimah) clash over Umar's wasteful nature; eventually, he sinks so far into debt that he must sell his daughter, Djuliah (Djoewariah), to a loan shark named Asnan (O. Parma), a move which breaks the heart of Djuliah's boyfriend Ruhiyat (A Bakar). Other scenes include comic interactions between two servants, Icah (Ijem) and Djemblug (Komung).|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{who have no}} symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options {{to respond to it}} in a way that prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E

5|$|There was {{increased}} looting on December 20, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The cacerolazos continued; large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> started demonstrations {{calling for the}} government's resignation. The unions—first the CTA and then the CGT—began general strikes against the state of emergency. Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last administrative action was to lift the state of emergency. He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19:45 local time on December 20, 2001, and left the Casa Rosada in a helicopter. He had ruled for two years, half of his term of office.|$|E
5|$|They {{prohibited}} mass gatherings in {{an attempt}} to stop entire villages or other large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from emigrating together, and also isolated people who sold their water buffalo and other belongings, as this was a clear sign that they intended to end their farming. Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the International Control Commission about the violations of the Geneva Accords, but little action was taken. According to B. S. M. Murti, the Indian representative on the ICC, the communists did not try to stop the refugees at first, but increased their efforts over time as it became clearer that large proportions of the population wanted to emigrate.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have}} found that 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E

5000|$|Strictly speaking, {{the term}} [...] "Kaonde" [...] {{refers to a}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who are {{identified}} by a common language known as kiiKaonde. This <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> like many others in Zambia, was originally part of the Luba Kingdom. They migrated south to area surrounding a stream called Kaonde in river Congo basin. From there, the people migrated into what is now Northwestern Zambia. This <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> called their language kiiKaonde. Speakers of other Bantu languages use the prefix [...] "chi" [...] other than [...] "kii" [...] to refer to this language. Thus non-Kaondes sometimes call the language Chikaonde.|$|R

5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E
5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E
