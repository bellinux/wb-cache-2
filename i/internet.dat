40|$|Abstract. The <b>Internet’s</b> inter-domain routeing {{system has}} evolved {{to keep pace}} with the <b>Internet’s</b> rapid growth, from a few co-operatively managed {{administrative}} domains to a large number of competetive domains. This growth has brought to light one of the <b>Internet’s</b> shortcomings: lack of support for efficient control and management of traffic, particularly between domains. This paper presents an extension to BGP, the inter-domain routeing protocol, that enables congestion to drive route selection and thus allows economic incentives to play their part in traffic distribution. Implementation in a deployed BGP stack is discussed and a simple simulation presented, showing better traffic distribution. ...|$|R
