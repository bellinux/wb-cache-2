He was felled by a sickening blow {{to the back of the}} head from 19-year-old paceman Wasim Akram. After retiring hurt, Cairns was hospitalised with a suspected hairline <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and complained of 'dizzy spells' for months afterwards. In testament to his courage, Cairns was 'padded up', this time with a helmet, ready to return to the crease, as New Zealand fought another famous rearguard action to win the test and series. History showed he was not required as Jeremy Coney (111*), this time supported by number eleven Ewen Chatfield (21*), took New Zealand to victory by two wickets.|$|E

His parachute was discovered unopened and it was deduced that he may have hit his head on the vertical stabiliser of his aircraft when trying to escape. The death certificate listed [...] "closed <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and facial bone" [...] as his cause of death. He was posthumously awarded the 44th Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 23 January 1944.

Following the incident, Premier League officials, players, pundits, player's representatives and even MPs expressed views either condemning or supporting Hunt and the others involved {{in the aftermath of}} the incident. [...] The FA eventually confirmed that no action would be taken against Hunt but, in the mean time, both Hunt and teammate Ibrahima Sonko, involved in a collision in the same match with Čech's replacement Carlo Cudicini, had allegedly received death threats from Chelsea fans. Hunt scored his first Premier League goal in the 6-0 home win over West Ham.|$|E
2500|$|At age seven, William {{reportedly}} {{told his mother}} {{that he wanted to}} be a police officer when he was older so that he might be able to protect her; a statement to which his brother Harry responded: [...] "Oh, no you can't. You've got to be King." [...] William's first public appearance was on 1 March 1991 (Saint David's Day), during an official visit of his parents to Cardiff, Wales. After arriving by aeroplane, William was taken to Llandaff Cathedral where he signed the visitors' book, thereby demonstrating that he was left-handed. On 3 June 1991, William was admitted to Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the side of the forehead by a fellow student wielding a golf club. He did not lose consciousness, but suffered a depressed <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and was operated on at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar. In a 2009 interview, he dubbed this scar a [...] "Harry Potter scar". He was reported to have said, [...] "I call it that because it glows sometimes and some people notice it—other times they don't notice it at all".|$|E

60|$|Even if we admit Mr. Reid's conception, this by {{no means}} solves the problem. It is quite {{conceivable}} that the world could purchase certain sorts of immunity too dearly.

A time would no doubt come when those with a specific liability to skull fracture would all be eliminated, and the human cranium would have developed a practical immunity to damage from all sorts of falling substances. But there would have been far more extensive suppressions than would appear in the letter of the agreement.|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} the counsel for the prosecution, he stated {{that he was at}} the Vintry Mill at seven o'clock {{on the morning of the}} 6th of July, not professionally, but as taking {{interest}} in the Ward family. He had seen the body of the deceased, and considered death to have been occasioned by <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> from a blow with a blunt heavy instrument. The superintendent had shown him a rifle, which he considered, from the marks on it, as well as from the appearance of the body, to have produced the injury. The rifle was the one shown to him; it was the property of Leonard Ward. He recognized it by the crest and cipher H. E. It had belonged to his son-in-law, Hector Ernescliffe, by whom it had been given to Leonard Ward.|$|E

30|$|Today, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> x-ray only plays a {{historical}} role in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> TBI patients. In patients with impaired consciousness and a <b>skull</b> <b>fracture,</b> <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> an intracranial hemorrhage amounts to 1 in 4 (Mendelow et al. 1983). On the other hand, patients with clear consciousness and no skull fracture only show a probability of 1 : 6000 of developing an intracranial hemorrhage. If a skull fracture is detected by skull x-ray {{in a patient}} with clear consciousness, he should be transferred to an institution where a CT scan can be performed soon (Brandt et al. 2009). The fractures detectable by skull x-ray are divided into linear fractures, impression fractures (or expression fractures) and burst <b>fractures.</b> <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fracture</b> may be classified as <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convexity, <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> base, frontobasal <b>fractures,</b> temporal bone <b>fractures,</b> and <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condyles.|$|R

5000|$|The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, {{written in}} the 17th century BC, {{contains}} the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two patients, wounded in the head, who had compound <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> <b>The</b> assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author (a battlefield surgeon) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papyrus allude to ancient Egyptians having a vague recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> head trauma. While the symptoms are well written and detailed, <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> a medical precedent is apparent. <b>The</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage notes [...] "the pulsations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exposed brain" [...] and compared <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain to <b>the</b> rippling surface <b>of</b> copper slag (which indeed has a gyral-sulcal pattern). <b>The</b> laterality <b>of</b> injury was related to <b>the</b> laterality <b>of</b> symptom, and both aphasia ("he speaks not to thee") and seizures ("he shutters exceedingly") after head injury were described. Observations by ancient civilizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human brain suggest only a relative understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic mechanics and <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> cranial security. Furthermore, considering <b>the</b> general consensus <b>of</b> medical practice pertaining to human anatomy was based on myths and superstition, <b>the</b> thoughts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlefield surgeon appear to be empirical and based on logical deduction and simple observation.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} imaging {{techniques}} that can aid in diagnosing and assessing <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> brain damage, such as computed tomography (CT) scan, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). CT scans and MRI are the two techniques widely used and are most effective. CT scans can show brain bleeds, <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> fluid build up in the brain {{that will lead to}} increased cranial pressure. MRI is able to better to detect smaller injuries, detect damage within the brain, diffuse axonal injury, injuries to the brainstem, posterior fossa, and subtemporal and subfrontal regions. However patients with pacemakers, metallic implants, or other metal within their bodies are unable to have an MRI done. Typically the other imaging techniques are not used in a clinical setting because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost, lack <b>of</b> availability.|$|R
50|$|The {{human remains}} {{recovered}} from Semna South {{have been studied}} by numerous anthropologists and other specialists. Hrdy (1978) analyzed hair samples from Semna South mummies. He concluded that <b>the</b> hair color <b>of</b> these individuals was lighter than previously thought in ancient Nubia and <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> X-Group males was curlier than the Meroitic males. In 1993, Arriaza, Merbs, and Rothschild published a study evaluating <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> a pathological condition known as {{diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis}} (DISH). They found that approximately 13% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individuals from the Meroitic cemetery were afflicted with this condition and that it was more common among males. Alvrus (1999) assessed the skeletal fracture patterns for almost 600 individuals from the Semna South site. She analyzed healed <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and appendicular skeleton and found that almost 21% of adults had at least one healed fracture and that <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> was <b>the</b> most frequently injured region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. She attributes much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trauma to the rocky physical environment, but also notes that craniofacial trauma may be <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> interpersonal violence.|$|R
