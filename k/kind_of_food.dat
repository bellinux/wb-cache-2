5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E

One {{of the pioneers}} was the Bombay Brasserie, which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> actually eaten in India, and has remained fully booked ever since. It was followed in 1990 by Chutney Mary in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars {{for the quality of}} their cooking.|$|E
5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The tips of the jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It {{is more likely that}} they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Seizure {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{pediatric}} neurology problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> on seizures <b>of</b> epileptic children based on their mothers attitude and experience. Methods: In a descriptive- analytic study done at the pediatric neurology clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University, attitude and experience of mothers regarding the effect <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> on children seizures was evaluated via a questionnaire. Results: A total of 148 mothers with ages ranging between 17 - 52 years (mean± SD: 31. 6 ± 6. 6 years) were evaluated. Their children were 58. 5 % boys and 41. 5 % girls with age range of 1 - 19 years (mean± SD: 6. 2 ± 3. 8 years). Eighty percent of mothers believed that different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> affected the seizures and this belief was not related to their educational level, gender of child or state of seizure control. The most common <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> which triggered seizures based on mothers attitude were salty food and pickled vegetables and based on experience, they were cucumber and milk and. The most common <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> that caused decreasing in seizures frequency based on mothers attitude were coffee and cattle oil and based on experience, they were honey and sugar. Conclusion: In this study, majority of mothers believe that different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> have an effect on the seizures in their children and it is necessary to educate epileptic patients about their diet after extraction and testing of effective materials <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> in animals and human models via further researches...|$|R

40|$|Food {{preference}} and food intake behaviors were investigated on 40 children for 21 <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> using foodcards. Bell pepper, leek, radish and shiitake mushroom {{were the most}} unpopular foods to children. These are foods with unique smell, sliminess, and stickiness. Children seem to dislike such <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foods.</b> Food {{preference and}} food intake behaviors in children have changed {{from the age of}} 4 to 5 years. For example, foods that over 60 % or more of children answered to come to dislike more in five-year-olds than in four-year-olds were shiitake mushroom, natto, eggplant and radish. Regarding rank difference correlation in five ranks <b>of</b> <b>food</b> preference and three ranks <b>of</b> <b>food</b> intake behaviors in children, correlation was statistically significant in all 21 <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> with 1 % significance.

25|$|Researchers from Kumamoto University {{also began}} to focus on the cause of the strange disease.

The staple food of victims was invariably fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans.

25|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} {{and interest in}} food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations. Industries have sprung up with print publications and media dedicated to expounding on the principles and ideals of pairing the perfect wine with the perfect dish. In the restaurant industry, {{there is often a}} dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers who are trained to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant's fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon {{can be traced to the}} United States in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back wine labels. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they inquired along seven lines before they {{determined}} that a genital discharge rendered a man unclean. A discharge caused by one of these reasons did not render the man impure or subject him to bringing an offering. They asked: (1) about his food, (2) about his drink, (3) what he had carried, (4) whether he had jumped, (5) whether he had been ill, (6) what he had seen, and (7) whether he had obscene thoughts. It did not matter whether he had had thoughts before or after seeing a woman. Rabbi Judah taught that the discharge would not render him unclean if he had watched animals having intercourse or even if he merely saw a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva taught that the discharge would not render him unclean {{even if he had}} eaten any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. The Sages exclaimed to Rabbi Akiva that according to his view, no more men would ever be rendered unclean by genital discharge. Rabbi Akiva replied that one does not have an obligation to ensure that there exist men unclean because of a genital discharges.|$|E

500|$|As a {{teenager}} David enjoyed painting, {{and her mother}} thought her talent worth developing. She was sent to Paris in 1930, studying painting privately and enrolling at the Sorbonne for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous {{and in many ways}} uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to the pleasures of the table she portrayed to comic effect in her French Provincial Cooking (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: [...] "I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors.... What had stuck was the taste for a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> quite ideally unlike anything I had known before." [...] Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter's early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.|$|E
