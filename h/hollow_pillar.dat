It is a large square temple with a central skylight, that can be built with Chinese and/or Tibetan construction techniques and materials. The second floor consists in galleries or rooms arranged around a courtyard surrounding the central skylight: this concentric layout forms a three-dimensional mandala. Seen from the exterior, the complexity of the inner structure remains unsuspected. Chinese sources present it as modelled on the architecture of the Potala palace.

Results from transmittance measurements exhibit diameter dependent peaks that are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.

We have found that the transmission of IR through bared Si is 53 % which is independent of wavelength. Arrays of Si pillars with mean diameter 1. 33 μm ± 36 nm show transmission peak at wavelength of 6. 2 μm and array of Si pillars having mean diameter 1. 42 μm ± 35 nm shifts the transmission peak at wavelength of 7. 5 μm.

40|$|Behaviour {{of single}} {{bacterium}} have been mysterious {{for many years}} due to the technical difficulty and nature of bacteria forming communities. It has not been long since engineers and scientists have started to develop various techniques and devices to study and isolate single bacterium. In the present thesis, three subprojects with a common theme of applying single bacterium cells for engineering application or investigating regulation of gene expressions is introduced. Recently, metal structures with micrometer dimensions have been fabricated and successfully utilized to isolate single bacterial cells with dimensions similar to the designed pillars. First project further develops previously discovered feature of single bacterial cell isolation by metal hollow structures to capture polymeric nanoparticles inside the hollow structures. High achievement rates of filling the nanoparticles inside the structures and subsequently capping the top opening of <b>hollow</b> <b>pillars</b> have been attained. The study demonstrates that the shape of structures affects both the capturing rate and capping rate of nanoparticles. In the second project, a fabrication method and result of simple template to obtain well organized array of single bacterial cells is shown. The bacterial cells with size less than micrometer are patterned on a gold substrate in a uniform matter. The technique developed here requires no additional binding agent nor chemical modification of the substrate which provides an advantage in saving the processing time and cost in comparison to existing techniques developed to isolate single bacterial cells. The isolated bacterial cells are further engineered with magnetic nanoparticles to illustrate bacterial cell wall property remaining the constant after deposition. In the last project, promoter activity of single cells has been analyzed to study the population behaviour of the bacterial culture. In contrast to {{the assumption that the}} behaviour of a single bacterium would be identical as a group, the opposite behaviour was found.

While several strategies are developed to control the structural properties of non-Pt catalysts and boost their electrocatalytic activities for the HER, the generation of highly reactive defects or interfaces by combining a metal with other metals, or with metal oxides/sulfides, can lead to notably enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, the preparation of cactus-like hollow Cu 2 - xS at Ru nanoplates (NPs) that contain metal/metal sulfide heterojunctions and show excellent catalytic activity and durability for the HER in alkaline media is reported. The initial formation of Ru islands on presynthesized Cu 1. 94 S NPs, via cation exchange between three Cu+ ions and one Ru 3 +, induces {{the growth of the}} Ru phase, which is concomitant with the dissolution of the Cu 1. 94 S nanotemplate, culminating in the formation of a hollow nanostructure with numerous thin Ru <b>pillars.</b> <b>Hollow</b> Cu 2 - xS at Ru NPs exhibit a small overpotential of 82 mV at a current density of - 10 mA cm- 2 and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec- 1 under alkaline conditions; this catalyst is among state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. The excellent performance of hollow Cu 2 - xS at Ru NPs originates from the facile dissociation of water in the Volmer step...|$|R
