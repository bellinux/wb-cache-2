Design A systematic sample of injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> not currently in a treatment program were recruited and interviewed at needle exchange programs and community sites. Participants 135 injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> younger than 30 years and 96 injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> aged 30 or older. Results Injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> younger than 30 were {{twice as likely as}} <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> aged 30 or older to report having shared needles in the past 30 days (36 / 135 [27 %] vs 12 / 96 [13 %]). Injection <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> younger than 30 were also twice as likely to report having had more than two sexual partners in the past 6 months (80 / 135 [59 %] vs 29 / 96 [30 %]).

40|$|In general, {{little is}} known about the {{incidence}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> especially among non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam over an 18 -year period (1985 - 2002). Sera of 1, 268 <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5. 9 / 100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0 / 100 Person Years in 2002. Of the <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88 % were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw 3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were infected with the same strain, indicating that <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior. After 2000, no injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with an acute HBV infection were reported to the Public Health Service Amsterdam and the specific genotype D strain had disappeared.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> {{have a high}} {{prevalence}} of HCV and represent the majority of newly infected persons in the U. S. Despite the availability of effective HCV treatment, few <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> have been evaluated or treated for HCV. Racial and ethnic minorities have a higher incidence and {{prevalence of}} HCV and higher HCV-related mortality. Factors contributing to poor engagement in care are incompletely understood. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Fourteen mixed-gender focus groups of either African American or Latino/a <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> (N = 95) discussed barriers to HCV testing and treatment. Themes were identified through content analysis of focus group discussions. 				 				 					 						Results 					Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were tested for HCV in settings where they were receiving care. Outside of these settings, most were unaware of voluntary test sites. After testing HCV positive, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> reported not receiving clear messages regarding {{the meaning of a}} positive HCV test, the impact of HCV infection, or appropriate next steps including HCV clinical evaluations. Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> perceived treatment as unimportant because they lacked symptoms, healthcare providers minimized the severity of the diagnosis, or providers did not recommend treatment.

She was last seen alive outside a drive-in restaurant on Washtenaw Avenue two days before her body was discovered (although autopsy reports indicated Skelton had died between 24 and 36 hours before her body was discovered). Investigators noted strong similarities between this murder and previous killings attributed to the Michigan Murderer, including the fact that a garter belt had been tied around Skelton's neck and her clothes and shoes had been neatly placed beside her body. However, the dramatic increase in savagery exhibited against the victim and the fact that Skelton was a known <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> and dealer as opposed to a university student led some junior investigators to speculate her murder may have been drug-related.

25|$|New {{research}} in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs {{on the development of}} insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a <b>drug</b> <b>user.</b> The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, Lucilia sericata larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, bromazepam, levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, oxazepam, alimemazine, clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.|$|E

The <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C project aims to offer active <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam HCV testing and treatment using a multidisciplinary approach. METHODS: The study population comprises <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies and <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> referred to the <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C unit. <b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing and, if chronically infected, medical and psychiatric screening and HCV treatment. Various specialists collaborated to provide optimal care. We assessed test-uptake and treatment-uptake and outcomes. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-seven Amsterdam Cohort Studies <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing: 449 out of 497 (90 %) accepted. HCV antibodies were found in 267 out of 449 (60 %) : 183 out of 267 (69 %) were HCV-viremic and 49 out of 183 (27 %) were HIV-co-infected.

In total 58 persons were treated: 16 (27 %) with genotype 1 or 4, 42 (72 %) with genotype 2 or 3. Eighty-four percent used methadone, 97 % used drugs (heroin, cocaine or amphetamine) {{at least once in}} the 6 months before treatment, 19 % were active injectors. Sixty-two percent used alcohol, 41 % had psychiatric disease other than substance abuse. Of the 57 individuals with sufficient follow-up, 37 (65 %) achieved sustained virological response. CONCLUSION: In a multidisciplinary setting, HIV-negative <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with chronic HCV infection can be treated successfully despite active drug or alcohol use and psychiatric diseases. Therefore, access to HCV therapy using an integrated approach should be increased for this population...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the prevalence of}} HIV, HBV and HCV infections among injecting and non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> treated within public drug-treatment centres in Italy to determine the correlates of infection. In the sample of 1330 <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> the prevalence of HIV was 14. 4 % among drug injectors and 1. 6 % among non-injectors; the prevalence of HBV was 70. 4 % among injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and 22. 8 % among non-injectors and of HCV was 83. 2 % among injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and 22. 0 % among non-injectors. Old age, unemployment, and intravenous drug use were significantly correlated {{with each of the}} infections, as well as a longer history of injecting drug use. The results indicate that these infections continue to circulate among <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> highlighting the need for monitoring of this group in Italy...|$|R
50|$|Of the 60,000-100,000 injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Taiwan, 10-15% may be {{infected}} with CRF07_BC. If so, they probably represent {{the largest group}} of such intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in northeast Asia. The circulating recombinant form might have followed a separate drug-trafficking route to Taiwan from Yunnan via southeast China, Guangxi, and Hong Kong. There have been enormous increases in the amount of heroin smuggled into Taiwan and in the number of intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> since 2002, when five intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> from southern Taiwan were diagnosed as the country's first HIV-1 seropositive cases infected with CRF07_BC. Even though the Hong Kong authorities identified three cases of CRF07_BC infection in 2001, a serious outbreak in that city's population of intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> {{is believed to have been}} blocked by a methadone maintenance program.|$|R
