5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E

5|$|The Obscene Publications Act 1959 (c. 66) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament that {{significantly}} reformed the law related to obscenity in England and Wales.

During the 1950s, the Society of Authors formed a committee to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. After several failed attempts to push a bill through Parliament, a committee finally succeeded in creating a viable bill, which was introduced to Parliament by Roy Jenkins and given the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, coming into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959. With the committee consisting of both censors and reformers, the actual reform of the law was limited, with several extensions to police powers included in the final version.|$|E

The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E
