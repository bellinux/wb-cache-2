40|$|Abtract-The design, {{construction}} and performance {{evaluation of a}} cassava chips dryer using fuel wood as source of heat was undertaken {{with a view to}} help small scale farmers ’ process cassava chips. The dryer consists of a <b>frame,</b> <b>drying</b> chamber, a tray, fuel wood housing, perforated air space and a chimney. The dryer was evaluated in terms of final moisture content, drying capacity, time taken to dry the chips {{and the quality of the}} chips. Results showed that the moisture content of 65. 03 % (wb) was reduced to 13. 11 %, the drying capacity was 6 kg per loading and the drying time which was supposed to be 3 hrs was increased to 4 hrs due to difficulty in regulating the heat produced by the fuel wood. Compared to other types of dryers (solar dryer, platform dryer, flat – bed dryer, continuous dryer e. t. c), the batch type dryer is preferred due to its ability to be used during rainy season and in the absence of electricity. The quality of the chips was found to be good. The dryer has an efficiency of 80 %. The evaluation of the dryer shows that it can be used for small scale drying of cassava. chips.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to combine {{advantages}} of two processes: air drying and frying to produce toasted tortillas with lower fat content in comparison with those commercial items existing in the market. Product characterization of four commercial brands was carried out; characteristics, such as moisture (1. 8 - 6. 7 %) and fat percentages (22 - 28 %), color parameters (L: 23 - 25, a: 0. 04 - 0. 18, b: 1. 3 - 2. 5) and texture (5. 8 - 7. 6 N) were measured in order to establish a reference <b>frame.</b> <b>Drying</b> with hot air (35, 48 and 68 °C) at 2, 4 and 6 m/s were applied to dry tortillas, in which the final moisture contents were in the range of 6 - 12 % and taking 30 - 200 min of treatment, as a function of the variables, to reach 10 % of moisture. While frying was conducted with a standardized initial moisture of 10 % at 140, 160 and 180 °C, in which only two minutes were utilized to get the toasted tortillas. In general terms, at a given temperature lower moisture and higher fat contents were measured for longer frying times, and finding that tortillas dried at 4 m/s resulted in better product attributes. There was significant effect of the drying conditions on the fried product. The toasted product had 2 - 4 % moisture, 10 - 12 % fat, which is lower than commercial products; and it developed similar quality attributes to those of commercial “tostadas”. Mass transfer parameters were computed for processes, drying and frying. Finally an optimization was carried out, with the Design Expert software and experimentally as well.

PCA shows that heavy metals originated from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Although {{this study may}} be limited in terms of sample size and sample collection time <b>frame</b> (<b>dry</b> season), it suggests roadside plant transport heavy metals from stems to leaves more readily than from roots to stems. This indicates that metals in the root zone are transported weakly to the stem but easily mobilized to leaves when available in the stems. A lab-based study could be possible ensuring the metal accumulation and transportation mechanism within roadside plants as well as ensuring the safe level if cooked (AE species) or used for medicinal purposes (CO species) by the local resident. Perhaps next study should also consider more roadside plant species, the influence of wet and dry weather seasons, and the concentration of metal in air particulate matter and watercourse nearby the study area. Comparison between direct metal airborne deposition to plant surfaces and metal uptake from soils {{also need to be}} considered. More comprehensive monitoring from various environmental medium probably enhances our understanding of the distribution, accumulation, and sources of metal in the tropical semi-urban area.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} approach, we explore wave-induced fluid flow effects in partially saturated porous rocks {{in which the}} gas-water saturation patterns are governed by mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties. The link between the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties and the gas saturation {{is defined by the}} assumption of capillary pressure equilibrium, which in the presence of heterogeneity implies that neighbouring regions can exhibit different levels of saturation. To determine the equivalent attenuation and phase velocity of the synthetic rock samples considered in this study, we apply {{a numerical}} upscaling procedure, which permits to take into account mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties as well as spatially continuous variations of the pore fluid properties. The multiscale nature of the fluid saturation is taken into account by locally computing the physical properties of an effective fluid, which are then used for the larger-scale simulations. We consider two sets of numerical experiments to analyse such effects in heterogeneous partially saturated porous media, where the saturation field is determined by variations in porosity and clay content, respectively. In both cases we also evaluate the seismic responses of corresponding binary, patchy-type saturation patterns. Our results indicate that significant attenuation and modest velocity dispersion effects take place in this kind of media for both binary patchy-type and spatially continuous gas saturation patterns and in particular in the presence of relatively small amounts of gas. The numerical experiments also show that the nature of the gas distribution patterns is a critical parameter controlling the seismic responses of these environments, since attenuation and velocity dispersion effects are much more significant and occur over a broader saturation range for binary patchy-type gas-water distributions. This analysis therefore suggests that the physical mechanisms governing partial saturation should be accounted for when analysing seismic data in a poroelastic framework. In this context, heterogeneities associated with the <b>dry</b> <b>frame</b> properties, which do not play important roles in wave-induced fluid flow processes per se, should be taken into account since they may determine the kind of gas distribution pattern taking place in the porous roc...|$|R
