40|$|While it is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} by scientists and governments that human activity contributes to climate change, {{there is a lack}} of understanding whether this realisation is now gaining greater attraction with the general public than it had 5 or 10 years ago. Additional gaps in knowledge relate to the link between awareness and action, which could be hypothesised to have become stronger in light of evidence being produced of some projected climate changes occurring already. This article examines climate change awareness and the link with travel-related decision-making by adopting an under-utilised origin perspective in Wellington, New Zealand. The ﬁndings, generated by a <b>household</b> <b>mail</b> survey, indicate that the majority of the respondents are aware of tourism’s contribution to climate change and think that it is likely that their lives in New Zealand will be negatively affected by climate change. However, when examining the respondents’ recent holiday decision-making, it is evident that for the overwhelming majority, climate change awareness does not appear to inﬂuence travel-related decisions. This article concludes by discussing demand-focused measures aimed at reducing the GHG emissions generated by tourism...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} {{presented}} {{the results of}} a random <b>household</b> <b>mail</b> survey on risk perception and behavioral responses to a Natech accident experienced at an industrial park in Sendai, Japan, after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011. Interestingly, the evacuation process that followed the earthquake, tsunami, and Natech accident involved multiple evacuations. The study showed that Natech risk perception changed throughout the evacuation process. Comparatively low mean risk perception levels (in terms of perceived likelihood) occurred before the earthquake. Higher mean risk perception levels (in terms of perceived severity) occurred when households perceived the Natech accident, especially while they were staying at either the first or second evacuation shelter, and when they received the actual Natech evacuation order. Furthermore, the study confirmed that risk perception has a significant and positive effect on evacuation behavior. Thus, finding ways to improve households’ risk perception concerning Natech hazards may lead to increased evacuation for any future Natech accident. This finding is important because it confirms the conclusion of previous research that expected personal impacts are strong motivation for a person’s protective actions (Fitzpatrick and Mileti 1991; Sorensen 2000; Huang et al. 2012; Lindell and Prater 2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{organizations}} {{in both the}} public and private sector implement plain language policy initiatives that aim to achieve a variety of organisational goals by changing the written language used to communicate with end-users such as citizens and customers. But various studies indicate that recipients often only read few, selected parts of the written material they receive. This means, that there are significant factors other than those grammatical and stylistic which dictate how the recipients receive and use the written information; as a consequence these other factors should attract our attention. The aim of this thesis is to create a more empirically rooted knowledge of how real recipients in real communicative situations receive and use personally addressed <b>household</b> <b>mail</b> from public and private organizations, and to identify factors in the written material and in the situations which are significant in this context. Using Brenda Dervin’s Sense-Making Methodology, this thesis examines how real recipients navigate through communicative situations and make sense of personally addressed <b>household</b> <b>mail.</b> Additionally, the thesis analyses the factors in the mail and in the communicative situation which either facilitates a progression in the sense-making process, or act as barriers. Sperber & Wilson's relevance theory is then applied in order to examine the role played by the recipients’ assessment of relevance. This issue is examined empirically through qualitative interviews with six respondents, and the results are discussed in relation to the grammatical and stylistic focus, which is the starting point for the plain language policy projects in many organisations. This study shows that communication should be seen as a process, and that the recipient is central {{to the understanding of the}} message. The results indicate that factors such as the recipients' knowledge and background, practices and routines, reading strategies, information needs, assessment of relevance and especially knowledge about the communication situation are central to the recipient's construction of meaning. This means that selection of information, relevance optimization, point-of-view, principles of composition, graphic design, choice of media, etc. should have a very prominent place in the communications planning process. It also means that communications planning, to the extent that it is at all possible, should be based on the specific expected communicative situation and the intended function of the text in the given situation, considering whether the situation is a routine situation for the recipient, the level of prior contact between sender and receiver and finally the conditions in that specific situation that can ease or hinder the progression through the use situation. ...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) co-sponsored two {{national}} random digit dial (RDD) telephone surveys {{during the summer}} of 2002. Stakeholders expressed concern about the potential bias in travel-related behavior estimates because the sample designs of these surveys excluded the four percent of nontelephone (non land line) households. Nontelephone households may have different travel-related behaviors compared to telephone households. While there have been other studies of nontelephone households, they have not focused on travel-related behaviors. BTS responded to this concern by conducting the Supplemental Survey, a travel-behavior-related nontelephone household survey designed to investigate possible differences. However, the survey only yielded an unweighted CASRO response rate of 21 percent. Because data for both respondents and nonrespondents were available from the sample frame, we conducted a nonresponse bias analysis for this unique survey. One of the purposes of this work was to identify whether nonrespondents in travel surveys are different compared to nonrespondents in other surveys. The analysis includes both bivariate and multivariate analyses to ascertain predictors of nonresponse to the survey. Multivariate analyses indicate that in this nontelephone <b>household</b> <b>mail</b> survey, nonrespondents {{were more likely to be}} under 35, male, have less than a high school education, and live in a household with more than one person, children, and no vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Background. Population-wide {{screening}} for people at average risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) by faecal occult blood test (FOBT) is under consideration in Australia. Methods. Qualitative methods {{were used to}} examine the views of community members who did (n = 18) or did not (n = 12) participate in a pilot program of FOBT screening. In addition, views were obtained from general practitioners (GPs) and specialist gastroenterologists directly involved in the implementation of the program. Two focus group sessions were conducted with screening participants and interviews were conducted with non-participants, GPs and gastroenterologists. Results. The findings suggest that CRC screening by FOBT distributed to <b>households</b> by <b>mail</b> was well accepted by the community and by the medical practitioners involved in its implementation. The trial had little negative effect on general practice. Both medical practitioners and consumers raised concerns about the efficacy of FOBT screening. Medical practitioners were also concerned about the potential burden mass screening could place on the public (government-funded) health care sector. Conclusions. It would seem that CRC screening using FOBT will not enjoy unqualified support from the community or from medical practitioners involved in the continuum of screening. Information about the objectives of screening programs, in general, and the efficacy of FOBT screening in particular, needs to be provided to the community to ensure informed individual choice...|$|R
500|$|In August 2007, an {{investigation}} by The Wall Street Journal revealed potential campaign finance irregularities involving Hsu, {{in his role as}} a [...] "bundler", and his long-time associates, the Paw family of Daly City, California. Specifically, members of the Paw family made donations of over $200,000 to Democratic candidates since 2005. These donations closely coordinated with those of Hsu in terms of timing, amounts and donees. In addition, the donations appeared to be much larger than would be expected given the Paw's modest income. According to records obtained for the investigation, the Paws own a gift shop and live in a [...] house that they recently refinanced for $270,000. William Paw, the 64-year-old head of the <b>household,</b> is a <b>mail</b> carrier with the U.S. Postal Service and earns approximately $49,000 a year. Other records linked Hsu to the Paws, including a campaign finance filing in which Hsu lists the Paw's home as his residence.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionIdentifying at-risk {{groups is}} a {{challenge}} in post-disaster psychosocial response. Geospatial techniques can support the design and deployment of targeted and tailored interventions. This study compared spatial patterns {{in the distribution of}} hospitalizations for substance abuse disorders and associated area-level predictors before and after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana. MethodsWe used hospital data from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals for 2004 (pre-Katrina) and 2008 (post-Katrina). Data were assessed by using descriptive statistics, multivariable Poisson regression, and geospatial analysis. We assessed hospitalizations by US Census block group in relation to the presence of blighted properties (ie, buildings declared an imminent health threat, in danger of collapse, or a public nuisance), race of residents (white or nonwhite), presence of nondisplaced residents (measured by the number of <b>households</b> receiving <b>mail</b> in 2008), and depth of water levels. ResultsThe hospitalization rate for substance abuse disorders was 7. 13 per 1, 000 population for 2004 and 9. 65 per 1, 000 for 2008. The concentration of hospitalizations shifted geographically from block groups exposed to floods (levee breaches) in 2004 {{to the center of the}} city in 2008. Post Katrina, predictors for hospitalizations were presence of blighted properties, nonwhite populations, and presence of nondisplaced residents. Distance from flooded areas (high water depth) and levee breaches was negatively associated with hospitalizations. Men were more likely than women to be hospitalized during both periods (78 %, 2004; 63 %, 2008), and the percentage of the hospitalized white population increased from 2004 (28. 8 %) to 2008 (44. 9 %). ConclusionGeographic patterns of hospitalizations for substance abuse disorders shifted in post-Katrina New Orleans from flood-exposed areas to less exposed areas in the center of the city; however, poverty was a main predictor for hospitalizations during both periods. Approaches used in this study are generalizable to other disaster areas and to other psychological vulnerabilities (eg, anxiety). 27736053 PMC 506360...|$|R
40|$|The 1995 Census Test {{evaluated}} {{two fundamental}} changes in decennial census design: sampling for Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) and integrated coverage measurement (ICM). Sampling of nonresponding <b>households</b> after the <b>mail</b> phase of the census will reduce the workload and cost of the census. Housing units not returning their census forms by mail are classified by the Postal Service as occupied or vacant; a sample of occupied nonresponding households is then selected and used to estimate for the universe of nonresponding households. ICM attempts to mitigate differential undercoverage experienced in past censuses by incorporating estimates of omitted persons directly into the final census products. A subsample will be drawn to estimate the residual undercoverage of the census, and estimates of the undercoverage will {{be integrated into the}} final count. Although the use of sampling for characteristics has been a feature of modern censuses, the 2000 Census {{will be the first to}} use sampling to determine the number of persons. Consequently, estimation of variance for census data products has become a matter of increased importance. The paper will summarize the methodology implemented for the 1995 Census Test, aspects of which were previously presented (Town and Fay 1995). The paper elaborates features of the application...|$|R
40|$|In December 2013, Canada Post {{announced}} {{they would be}} converting approximately five million <b>households</b> from door-to-door <b>mail</b> delivery to community mailboxes (CMB). The {{decision was made to}} address decreasing letter mail volume and operating losses experienced by the crown corporation. The CMBs will be phased in over the five years mainly in urban areas across the country. The decision to convert to CMBs makes Canada the only among the G 8 countries to end home delivery of mail. As a result, no research exists on the implications of the change. Particular concern has been raised over how the conversion will affect older adults. One area that needs examination is the consequences of the CMBs delivery model on fall rates among older adults in the winter. Falls are common among seniors, with 20 - 30 % community dwelling older adults falling each year. The risk of falling is increased in the winter when there is snow and ice on the ground. Injuries dues to falls consume a great deal of healthcare resources. The purpose of this scoping literature review was to determine: What are the implications for the elderly population of Canada Post’s decision to convert home delivery of mail to community mailbox delivery? Specifically, the review focused on how the conversion may impact fall rates among older adults in the winter...|$|R
40|$|Presented in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Master of Education Degree in the College of Education and Human Service Professions, University of Minnesota Duluth, 2015 Committee names: Bruce Munson (Chair), William Fleischman, Martha Minchak. The purpose of this exploratory quantitative mail survey was to discover Duluth residents’ knowledge, attitudes, and values towards the urban deer herd. An area based purposive sample was drawn and the <b>households</b> selected were <b>mailed</b> a four-part questionnaire. The sample was comprised of households in 5 of Duluth’s 34 Deer Hunt Areas (DHAs) which had been created by the Arrowhead Bowhunters Alliance (ABA). With a 32 % return rate (150 surveys returned of 469 viable sent), surveys found: scores of; 64 % correct on factual deer knowledge; personal experiences, family, and friends were the most common sources of knowledge; personal perceived knowledge was higher than the perceived knowledge of others; overall attitudes and values were positive towards deer; and communication benefits {{were the most important}} attitude and values topic. From these results, it was found that factual knowledge was low, self-initiated sources of knowledge were most common, residents’ perceived knowledge was higher than factual knowledge, and naturalistic attitudes were the highest while deer tolerance and educational values were the lowest. From these results, the following recommendations were made: schools could create more lessons revolving around deer in all subject matters to increase knowledge; nature centers and ELC’s could create more programs concentrating on deer to increase positive attitudes and values towards them; government agencies could use their position for outreach campaigns revolving around deer to reach a large amount of people; and the City of Duluth and the ABA could use the results of this survey to help create a management plan for the urban deer herd.

40|$|In 2001 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{adopted a}} new {{standard}} for arsenic (As) in drinking water of 10 μg/L, replacing the old standard of 50 μg/L. However, for the 12 % of the U. S. population relying on unregulated domestic well water, including half {{of the population of}} Maine, it is solely the well owner's responsibility to test and treat the water. A <b>mailed</b> <b>household</b> survey was implemented in January 2013 in 13 towns of Central Maine with the goal of understanding the population's testing and treatment practices and the key behavior influencing factors in an area with high well-water dependency and frequent natural groundwater As. The response rate was 58. 3 %; 525 of 900 likely-delivered surveys to randomly selected addresses were completed. Although 78 % of the households reported that their well has been tested, half of it was more than 5 years ago. Among the 58. 7 % who believe they have tested for As, most do not remember the results. Better educated, higher income homeowners who more recently purchased their homes are most likely to have included As when last testing. While households agree that water and As-related health risks can be severe, they feel low personal vulnerability and there are low testing norms overall. Significant predictors of including As when last testing include: having knowledge that years of exposure increases As-related health risks (risk knowledge), knowing who to contact to test well water (action knowledge), believing that regular testing does not take too much time (instrumental attitude), and having neighbors who regularly test their water (descriptive norm). Homeowners in As-affected communities have the tendency to underestimate their As risks compared to their neighbors. The reasons for this optimistic bias require further study, but low testing behaviors in this area {{may be due to the}} influence of a combination of norm, ability, and attitude factors and barriers...|$|R
40|$|PurposeFew {{studies have}} found {{differences}} in rates of epilepsy by race or ethnicity although previous reports indicate strong links between epilepsy and socioeconomic indicators. We investigated social and demographic factors {{as they relate to}} prevalence and incidence of epilepsy in Washington, DC, a culturally diverse area. MethodsProbability-based sampling was used to select 20, 000 DC <b>households</b> that were <b>mailed</b> an epilepsy screening survey. Demographic and epilepsy data were obtained on all household members. Screened individuals with a history of epilepsy or seizure disorder were sent a case survey asking more detailed questions about seizures and treatment which were used to verify case status using the standard case definition. Survey data were weighted to match characteristics of DC residents. Lifetime and active prevalence and incidence of epilepsy were estimated using weighted data and appropriate survey procedures in SAS. Key FindingsOverall survey response rate was 36. 6 %. 208 cases of epilepsy were identified during screening and 14 % with a case survey were considered false positive. Using the verified dataset, lifetime prevalence was 1. 53 % overall; 0. 77 % in Whites, 2. 13 % in Blacks, 3. 4 % in those with less than a high school diploma, and 2. 27 % in those with household income less than $ 30, 000. Overall prevalence of active epilepsy was 0. 79 % and followed similar subgroup comparisons as lifetime prevalence. Age-adjusted lifetime and active epilepsy from multivariate analyses demonstrated significantly higher rates for Blacks compared to Whites and for those not completing high school compared to those that attended graduate school. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 71 per 100, 000 persons. Adults with active epilepsy were significantly less likely to live alone than those without epilepsy (36. 0 % versus 46. 1 %). Residents of DC for less than four years had the lowest prevalence and incidence of all subgroups indicating a possible healthy mover effect. SignificanceOur study is the first to provide region-specific estimates and profiles of the epilepsy population in DC which can help inform policy makers and healthcare providers on where to better target resources to improve the health and outcomes of people with epilepsy and their families.
