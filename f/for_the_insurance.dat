5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, he worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, {{he worked for}} a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E

30|$|The {{imputation}} procedures {{described in}} the next section will be basically derived from education-related periods that are creditable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pension <b>insurance.</b> As spelled out earlier, the Pension Register records periods for which contributions were paid (employment, long-term illness, unemployment) as well periods without contributions, but which are still creditable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pension <b>insurance,</b> e. g. in terms of waiting times. While vocational training periods generally include periods with paid contributions, school and university episodes belong to the second type. By law, the former periods are creditable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pension <b>insurance</b> of up to 36 months, whereas the latter periods are creditable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pension <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> individuals in full time education after the age of 16 for up to 8  years.|$|R

25|$|In many states, {{the price}} of title {{insurance}} is regulated by a state insurance commission. In these states, the rate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> premium cannot be controlled by the industry. Unlike other forms of insurance (such as life, medical, or home owners), title insurance is not paid for annually, as it has one payment for the term of the policy, which is in effect until the property is resold or refinanced.|$|E
25|$|She applied <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> {{money the}} day after her husband's funeral.

It is unclear, however, whether that investigation actually occurred or Sorenson's body was ever exhumed to check for arsenic, as his relatives demanded. The insurance companies awarded her $8,500 (about $240,000 in 2012 dollars), with which she bought a farm {{on the outskirts of}} La Porte, Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Insurance {{may also}} be {{purchased}} through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.|$|E

500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> or the travel {{or any of the other}} expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
