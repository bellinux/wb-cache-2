5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his capture and {{imprisonment}} in York, Montagu escaped participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> and probably bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses which took place on 29 March 1461 at Towton in Yorkshire. This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York – and England's de facto new king – Edward IV entered York in triumph. Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands; as John Gillingham has put it, 'the 'unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.' And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland. One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of Carlisle, 'with prompt action.' Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily relieved by him, apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process, before Warwick had even arrived.|$|E
