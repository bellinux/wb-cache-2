5000|$|WTWO aired a one-minute promo on 2006 that criticized WTHI's weather coverage, {{claiming}} that WTHI's Doppler radar system was inferior to WTWO's {{because it was}} located within downtown Terre Haute, resulting in a [...] "dead zone" [...] - the area within the radius of the radar dome where reflectivity cannot be detected - over the city proper, stating that the WTWO radar's [...] "dead zone" [...] was positioned over a corn field and claimed that the combined experience of WTWO's weather staff {{was more than that}} of WTHI's staff; it also stated that WTHI's power had multiple points of failure in contrast to WTWO's. The promotion, though technically accurate, became a source of amusement on Comedy Central's The Daily Show because of its use of hyperbole and techniques reminiscent of political [...] "attack ads". After general manager Duane Lammers called the Daily Show [...] "hard-up for material" [...] in a Tribune-Star article, host Jon Stewart mocked WTWO further in the following night's opening segment. A response video to The Daily Show and Stewart {{that was supposed to be}} <b>for</b> <b>internal</b> <b>uses</b> at the station was leaked on YouTube; it has since been taken down, but was uploaded once more on iFilm.|$|E
50|$|Many {{indigenous}} {{cultures have}} used Proteaceae as sustenance, medicine, for curing animal hides, {{as a source}} of dyes and firewood and as wood for construction. Aboriginal Australians eat the fruit of Persoonia, and the seeds of species from other genera, including Gevuina and Macadamia, form part of the diet of the indigenous peoples but are also sold throughout the world. The tender shoots of Helicia species are used in Java, and the nectar from the inflorescences of a number of species is drunk in Australia. Traditional medicines can be obtained from infusions of the roots, bark, leaves, or flowers of many species that are used as topical applications for skin conditions or internally as tonics, aphrodisiacs, and galactogens to treat headaches, cough, dysentery, diarrhea, indigestion, stomach ulcers, and kidney disease. The wood from the trees of this family is widely used in construction and <b>for</b> <b>internal</b> <b>uses</b> such as decoration; the wood from species of Protea, Leucadendron and Grevillea is especially popular. Many species are used in gardening, particularly genera of Banksia, Embothrium, Grevillea, and Telopea. Unfortunately, this use has resulted in the introduction of exotic species that have become invasive; examples include the Hakea Willow (Hakea salicifolia) and the Silky Hakea (Hakea sericea) in Portugal. Two species of Macadamia are cultivated commercially for their edible nuts.|$|E
