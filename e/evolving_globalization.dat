Methods: A convenience sample of 12 PA programs (one public and one private school in each of six US geographical regions) received surveys to distribute to their first-year students. Eleven programs returned 482 completed surveys. Results: A sizable majority of the students, 59. 8 %, indicated interest in international rotations. PA students with prior health care experience or prior international experience as a volunteer in missions work (faith-based or secular), or studying abroad {{were more likely to}} show interest in international rotations. Student interest in other languages and cultures, single marital status, and lack of dependents also correlates positively with increased interest in international experiences.

40|$|Through {{scholarly}} consideration {{this study}} evaluates structural competency gaps that precipitate state failure and examines the resulting {{consequences for the}} world community. As an elected official for over seventeen years, including service as a Member of Parliament, I have travelled {{to many of the}} regions reviewed in this study. I have heard firsthand accounts from witnesses of the consequences of state failure in countries including Afghanistan, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. Failing states have overlapping characteristics of structural competency failure, including the inability to provide healthcare, education, food, legitimate policing and economic sustainability. There are economic inequalities present as well as a loss of legitimacy, corruption and reduced social cohesion. Failure of rule of law is manifested in areas of judicial adjudication, security, reduced territorial control and systemic political instability. The international community often confronts these challenges in a manner that actually complicates issues further through lack of consensus among actors. Consequently, a new and emerging concept of sovereignty needs to be reviewed in terms of the post-modern state. The new and emerging human security compact, <b>evolving</b> <b>globalization</b> and the decline of the state redefine it within the new global order. In some instances the best interests of these failing and failed states would be best served by shared sovereignty with the international community; that is, trusteeship. International actors attempting to 2 ̆ 7 fix 2 ̆ 7 failed states must focus their attention on the issues affecting structural competency that have actually caused the state to fail in the first place. By addressing the structural competency of failed states with an understanding of the causes, it is possible to create the practical framework for a global model of statehood that prevents state failure. Effective policies of integrated state-building and resources targeted at bridging structural competency gaps require a better understanding of both the challenges and the solutions...|$|E

40|$|American {{foreign policy}} makers are rejecting {{international}} cooperative endeavors in protective human rights treaties {{because they are}} committed to a realist philosophy of international relations that suggests that national interest is determined by the accumulation of power and force.

National interest is the first priority of foreign policy, but realists do not recognize the potential benefits of international cooperation because of their focus on power through military strength to the exclusion of any alternatives. Detrimental efforts of realism can be discerned by exploring three human rights treaties that the U.

American foreign policy appears hypocritical because it does not live up to standards that it criticizes others for in human rights.

40|$|Do sector-specific factors {{common to}} all {{countries}} {{play an important role}} in explaining business cycle co-movement? We address this question by analyzing international co-movements of value added (VA) growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, country-specific factors, sector-specific factors, and idiosyncratic components. We estimate the model using Bayesian methods for 30 disaggregated sectors in the G 7 economies for the 1974 - 2004 period. Our findings show that, although there is a substantial role for sector-specific factors, fluctuations are dominated by country-factors. The world factor appears to play a minimal role because, when using aggregate data, the world factor captures both the factor {{common to all}} countries and industries and the factor common to the same industry across countries. We then examine how these factors <b>evolved</b> as <b>globalization</b> deepened over the past two decades. Our results suggest that business cycles at a disaggregate level have not become more synchronized internationally. This is mainly driven by a substantial fall in the volatility of world shocks during the globalization period, rather than a lower sensitivity of sectoral growth to world factors. Our results also reveal that world factors appear to be more important for industries with a higher level of international vertical integration...|$|R

As globalization changed the world, the structure of the <b>globalization</b> concept itself <b>evolved</b> too. <b>Globalization</b> of demographic and socio-economic factors and increasing level of consciousness of consumers led to a structural change in the economytowards industry based old economy to a new economy. The new economy is a knowledge based economy in which e-commerce is a dynamic factor. The Global Financial Crisis, influencing the world since 2007, had negative effects on global trade by causing contradiction in demand of almost all countries, particularly USA and EU. Being a key driver for productivity, competitiveness and thus economic recovery from the crises, e-commerce is thought to help to the enterprises in their efforts to reduce the negative effects of the crisis by increasing their market share, providing price advantages and improving their competitiveness. The study investigates the relation between the weight the enterprises in EU countries gave to e-commerce and their economic performance during the recovery period. The results of the study show that trade volumes and turnover values of the EU members shrank in 2007 - 2009, while turnover values of e-commerce has been increasing. Also it has been found that e-commerce is more stable than traditional trade in most of the EU members...|$|R

Earlier studies have merely recognized the phenomena and postulated preliminary assumptions about the behavior of globalizing internationals. In the ICT field, all the major globalization drivers [...] be they changes in the macro environment, industry globalization, or pressure for increased internal efficiency [...] point in only one direction: globalize or die. Limited managerial and financial resources are often the challenge for companies originating from small and open economies. The study received preliminary empirical support from the ICT field that globalizing internationals select only one or at most a few {{of a large number}} of unrelated international businesses for globalization. As globalization matures, they further seek growth through related diversification. Implementation at the business unit level seems to require a change in marketing strategies; both the broadness of the marketing offering and the degree of standardization were found to <b>evolve</b> as <b>globalization</b> proceeds. At the beginning of the globalization process, a more focused marketing strategy was selected, which was then broadened as globalization proceeded. Moreover, the marketing strategy was increasingly standardized in respect to products, but also to a certain extent for brands and channels. The article develops a framework and propositions that are examined with the multiple case-study method. It also suggests further empirical testing with a survey study. Finally, it draws both theoretical and managerial conclusions that are expected to be particularly useful for ICT companies from SMOPEC countries, but interestingly also for the US companies that are competing fiercely against globalizing internationals.

The current strategy is to use globally common equipment through predetermined global suppliers.

These factors are catalyst for GM to reevaluate the current global common strategy. This thesis will {{provide an overview of}} the CCRW organization and discuss how the sourcing strategy has <b>evolved</b> through <b>globalization.</b> Due to the large variety of production tooling, this thesis will narrow the focus to two case studies: the first being a Main Control Panel (MCP) and the second being a weld controller. These case studies are used as a method to determine {{the pros and cons of}} the current sourcing strategy, where the MCP is a highly integrated design maintained by CCRW HQ and the weld controller is a "blackbox" which CCRW defines the functional specifications and procures "off the shelf' from a predetermined global supplier. Through local China visits, literature review and preliminary cost assessments, it was determined that while local sourcing may be a viable option for both the MCP and weld controller, there is not enough determinate information to commit to a sourcing change in the case of the Main Control Panel. From onsite visits to potential MCP option suppliers in China, it appears that likely "local" arrangements exists, however, further company analysis and validation will need to be conducted to adopt the change.

As for the weld controller, the local product variation with the current global supplier (based locally) is recommended and was validated by CCRW weld engineers by the completion of this internship.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes contracting {{relationships between}} large-scale corporate retail and small farmers in Nicaragua between 2000 and 2008 and estimates {{the effects of}} participation this new market on household income and investment in productive assets. This research addresses three issues of central importance in the changing context of world agriculture: what are the determinants of small-scale farmers' participation in new markets <b>evolving</b> amid <b>globalization?</b> How do farmers choose among market opportunities, given that market selection now implies a varying set of investments and transaction requirements, {{and what are the}} consequences of their choices both for near-term household welfare and for investments in technologies and asset stocks with the potential to transform future income dynamics? Finally, what can be learned about modern marketing channels from the significant share of farmers who exit supermarket supply chains? The research in this dissertation validates both optimism and caution with respect to the potential of supermarket supply relationships to improve farmer welfare and stimulate productive investment. The evidence here indicates that farmers who enter the supermarket supply chain benefit from the insurance the contract provides against the significant volatility of the traditional market horticulture output price. Contracted farmers both experience significant positive effects on incomes and make significant investments in productive assets and irrigation. However, we conclude that the location of supermarket procurement basins is strongly determined by community access to roads, markets, and year-round water, suggesting that modern agri-food marketing channels may exacerbate extant rural geographic inequalities or create new ones. We find an extremely high rate of exit from the supermarket supply chain, evidence that discontinued suppliers warrant considerable more attention in future analyses of participation in and welfare effects of modern agri-food markets. We also find that farmers own participation decision is influenced by neighbors' experience and exit from the modern channel. Finally, we should remain prudent with respect to predictions of the long-term sustainability of estimated income and asset returns attributable to participation. Given the significant involvement of NGOs and the relatively early stage of the Nicaraguan supermarket sector, {{it remains to be seen}} what the regional equilibrium effects will be for the agricultural sector as more farmers enter these markets...|$|R
40|$|The current {{economic}} environment <b>evolves</b> under <b>globalization</b> circumstances, and {{it stands for}} the markets' globalization trend. Under these circumstances, information has a primordial role. The content of the transmitted information has changed significantly. As part of the economic information, the accounting information evolved as well and its whole circuit has been continuously modernized in {{the rhythm of the}} global changes. Thus, it had to adapt to the swing of capital markets worldwide and to aim toward a unique international accounting language, for the taste and understanding of its users. Historically, Romanian accounting records have been heavily influenced by the use of information for tax compliance purposes. The primary function of financial/accounting details collection and recording process has been seen by many Romanian entities and management/staff within the entities (both State and private) as being for taxation compliance and taxation reporting purposes. As a result of this, the reported information has tended to reflect a “form over substance” disclosure, that is, greater importance is placed on having particular documents or recording something in a specific way, rather than in “accurately” reflecting the financial position of the enterprise at a point in time or indicating whether the results for the period are an appropriate representation of what has occurred. Romanian accounting laws and regulations are not as such at fault, with the regulations providing for and encouraging treatments that are consistent in many ways with international accounting principles. Issues have however arisen on how laws and regulations are applied and have tended to reflect the background and outlook of Romanian accountants. Up to 31 December 2003, Romania was considered to be a hyperinflationary economy, under the criteria of IAS 29 “Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”. For Romanian statutory reporting, IAS 29 was not applied. In looking at financial statements where there are significant non-monetary items, users should keep this in mind and consider if there have been any revaluation of tangible and intangible assets and on what basis. The objective of IAS 29 is to establish specific standards for entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, so that the financial information provided is meaningful.

In many countries, the traditional sources of socioeconomic development, such as low labor costs, availability of inexpensive raw materials, and favorable geographic location are waning.  These economies are searching for new sources of competitive advantage that will allow for maintaining growth, among other things by boosting participation in international trade.

Subsistence, sustenance, growth and profitability of the air transport industry are dependent on the demand for transport from passengers and cargo as the main sources of revenue of the airline industry. The forces of globalization and liberalization, coupled with the very rapid development of low-cost operators, have tempered the growth and profitability of the aviation industry whilst, at the same time, greatly increasing the consumer (passenger and air freight user) advantages in terms of expanding the gamut of their choices, better quality and lower prices. The ever-expanding markets in the Asia and Pacific region hold great promise for a rapid growth of the aviation industry in years to come. Currently, the international civil aviation community is faced with many challenges <b>evolving</b> from <b>globalization,</b> liberalization of economic regulations, privatization of airlines and airports, commercialization of government services providers, increasing environmental controls, and the emerge of new technologies. To deal effectively with these challenges and issues will require a high level of cooperation among civil aviation authorities, airlines, airports, and providers of air services and products. Airlines under the new free trade regimes have been exposed to many changes and although GATS has an important role to play in this important field, the convergence of economic, safety, security and environmental issues makes a strong case for keeping regulation in these critical issues under the ICAO aviation umbrella. As air transport experiences structural, policy and regulatory environment changes, in the era of free trade it would be interesting to critically examine the impact of the aforementioned changes on the rights and protection of passengers. In this relation, it becomes very important to review the international, regional, and national efforts which have been made to enhance consumer protection and also have an important bearing on the rights of airline passengers. The thesis also addresses some emerging, non-traditional consumer protection issues, such as health, racial discrimination and the rights of disabled passengers. In view of the above, the well-developed consumer protection regimes in the United States and the European Union (EU) would be examined in depth and the results of its analysis would be used to develop a suitable model airline passenger protection in the rapidly expending economies of the Asia and Pacific Region...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 87 - 92). Globalization {{and terrorism}} are key issues in today's international affairs. Interdependence {{used to be}} among major powers and their respective colonies. The world continues to remain interdependent, yet, in a different form. Indeed, international relations almost always involve violence and war, nevertheless, they are also centered on economic interests and trade. Wars would {{most of the time}} have territorial purposes. Today, the United States is leading a war against trans-national terrorism, a phenomenon that has <b>evolved</b> throughout <b>globalization,</b> particularly with the advancement of technology and its relatively simple access. September 11 bluntly illustrated the use of a global means, the airplane, and a plot accurately masterminded {{in different parts of the}} world. Terrorism, in addition, acquired different aspects. In the past, it would be addressed against specific statesmen, related to a defined political cause. More recently, it remained a method with political objectives. Yet, it now targets innocent civilians, little involved in state policies. Nevertheless, in the eyes of the trans-national terrorists, no one is innocent. On the contrary, every person actually symbolizes the policies of the targeted state. Furthermore, the United States decided to launch a global war, a battle usually involving states, rather non-state actors. Such a position greatly affected the United States' relations with its allies, namely the European countries. The latter indeed have similar objectives in preventing and countering trans-national terrorism, particularly after having been subject to large-scale terrorist attacks at home. Yet, as opposed to American unilateralism, most European countries united in a multilateral perspective, strengthening intelligence and police measures among one another. In addition to the military approach, the United States left no choice to the other countries, which would either be with the United States, or automatically with the enemy. As a matter of fact, the source of transnational terrorism has increasingly been located in the Middle East. In the American view, the Middle East mostly hosts repressive, authoritarian, Islamic anti-American regimes which breed terrorism as a means of expression and which therefore ought to be replaced by democratic systems. The United States aims at doing so militarily. In the European view, the large immigrant population at home is composed of those who had fled countries either in conflict, or undergoing harsh political and economic crises. Following September 11, the Madrid and London attacks, immigrants with Muslim and Arab origins increasingly became associated with terrorism. As a result, Europe aimed at regulating and controlling migration, yet, with respect to human rights and refugees asylum. It therefore carefully analyzed the reason of migration and aims at promoting development in the immigrants' respective countries of Origin. As such, Europe witnessed internal divisions with regard to foreign policy vis-a-vis the United States on the one hand, and global terrorism on the other. The United Kingdom was the first to join the United States on such an initiative, while other European countries opted for policies established within a multilateral framework. This thesis brings together two different perspectives on a common inescapable reality. Both the American and European sides are aware that tans-national terrorism is implanted worldwide threatening virtually, yet, with very concrete consequences on the international order. 1 bound copy: 92 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
40|$|Just {{over ten}} years ago, Germans tore down a wall that divided their country and the whole of Europe. Stepping {{through the hole in}} the Berlin Wall, they took the first steps towards the reunification of West and East Germany and the end of the Cold War. Today another wall is being torn down—that between purely {{domestic}} law and international law. Companies are engaged in international trade at ever increasing rates. Environmental degradation has proved to be a global problem that cannot be solved with uncoordinated local measures. Individuals worldwide are pressing their governments for the recognition of a common set of human rights. These and other aspects of an increasingly interdependent world each present new challenges and opportunities for U. S. lawyers who must assess this evolving legal, regulatory, economic, and political context for their clients. United States law and the legal profession are each <b>evolving</b> due to <b>globalization.</b> Conversely, U. S. law and the legal profession each play a part in fostering globalization. This trend towards increased interdependence should make the internationalization of law school curricula a priority for the academy so that its students may meet the challenges of modern legal practice. Such internationalization would include not only increased analysis of foreign law, but also of public and private international law. As other commentators have focused on the need for U. S. lawyers to study comparative law, this article will focus instead on the intertwining of international law and domestic law and the importance of assessing this relationship as part of one 2 ̆ 7 s legal education. Lawyers trained in U. S. law schools learn that the Constitution gives Congress the power 2 ̆ 2 [t]o define and punish [...] . offenses against the Law of Nations. 2 ̆ 2 Some might also be able to cite the oft-quoted dicta from the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in The Paquete Habana that 2 ̆ 2 International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination. 2 ̆ 2 But what does this mean for today 2 ̆ 7 s practitioner? One century after Paquete Habana, we ask what is international law, how does it affect U. S. legal practice, and how should the law schools prepare their students? This article will proceed with the following main arguments: 1. What we call 2 ̆ 2 international law 2 ̆ 2 is currently in a period of rapid transformation; 2. It is more important than ever that graduating law students have at least a basic knowledge of the structure and instruments of public and private international law, as well as comparative law, because: a. International law is increasingly part of the U. S. lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s world, whether they know it not; and, b. U. S. law has been and continues to be a defining feature of international law. By assessing how the practice of law is evolving, this article hopes to provide signposts for ways in which the academy should adjust the methods and substance of legal education...|$|R
