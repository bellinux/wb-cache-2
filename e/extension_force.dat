60|$|At {{the same}} time, too, {{and out of}} the same mental processes, came the first {{distinct}} ideas of number. In the earliest stages, the presentation of several like objects produced merely an indefinite conception of multiplicity; as it still does among Australians, and Bushmen, and Damaras, when the number presented exceeds three or four. With such a fact before us we may safely infer that the first clear numerical conception was that of duality as contrasted with unity. And this notion of duality must necessarily have grown up side by side with those of likeness and equality; seeing {{that it is impossible to}} recognise the likeness of two things without also perceiving that there are two. From the very beginning the conception of number must have been as it is still, associated with the likeness or equality of the things numbered. If we analyse it, we find that simple enumeration is a registration of repeated impressions of any kind. That these may be capable of enumeration it is needful that they be more or less alike; and before any absolutely true numerical results can be reached, it is requisite that the units be absolutely equal. The only way in which we can establish a numerical relationship between things that do not yield us like impressions, is to divide them into parts that do yield us like impressions. Two unlike magnitudes of <b>extension,</b> <b>force,</b> time, weight, or what not, can have their relative amounts estimated only by means of some small unit that is contained many times in both; and even if we finally write down the greater one as a unit and the other as a fraction of it, we state, in the denominator of the fraction, the number of parts into which the unit must be divided to be comparable with the fraction.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to further our {{understanding}} of extensor muscles and their role for hand function. The aims of the studies were: To develop and evaluate a new device for finger extensor force measurements. To evaluate ultrasound {{as a tool for}} assessment of muscle architecture. To determine the correlation between extensor muscle force and hand function. To evaluate the degree of impaired finger extensor force in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the correlation to impaired hand function. To analyse the effect of hand exercise in RA patients and healthy subjects with ultrasound and finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> measurements. Method: A new finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> measuring device was developed and an ultrasound based method was {{used to be able to}} objectively measure the finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> and analyze the static and dynamic extensor muscle architectures. Measurements were made of healthy volunteers (n= 127) and RA patients (n= 77) during uninfluenced and experimental conditions. A hand exercise program was performed and evaluated with hand force measurements, hand function test, patient relevant questionnaires (DASH and SF- 36) and ultrasound measurements. Results: The new finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> measurement device was developed and then validated with measurements of accuracy as well as test-retest reliability. The coefficient of variation was 1. 8 % of the applied load, and the test-retest reliability showed a coefficient of variation no more than 7. 1 % for healthy subjects. Ultrasound examination on m. extensor digitorum communis (EDC) showed significant differences between healthy men and healthy women as well as between healthy women and RA patients. The extension and flexion force improved in both groups after six weeks of hand exercise (p< 0. 01). Hand function improved in both groups (p< 0. 01). The RA group showed improvement in the results of the DASH questionnaire (p< 0. 05). The cross-sectional area of the EDC increased significantly in both groups.

This paper presents the combination of two non-invasive methods for studying the extensor muscle architecture using ultrasound simultaneously with finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> measurements. Methods: M. extensor digitorum communis (EDC) was examined in 40 healthy subjects, 20 women and 20 men, aged 35 - 73 years. Ultrasound measurements were made in a relaxed position of the hand as well as in full contraction. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), pennation angle and contraction patterns were measured with ultrasound, and muscle volume and fascicle length were also estimated. Finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> was measured using a newly developed finger force measurement device. Results: The following muscle parameters were determined: CSA, circumference, thickness, pennation angles and changes in shape of the muscle CSA. The mean EDC volume in men was 28. 3 cm 3 and in women 16. 6 cm 3. The mean CSA was 2. 54 cm 2 for men and 1. 84 cm 2 for women. The mean pennation angle for men was 6. 5 ° and for women 5. 5 °. The mean muscle thickness for men was 1. 2 cm and for women 0. 76 cm. The mean fascicle length for men was 7. 3 cm and for women 5. 0 cm. Significant differences were found between men and women regarding EDC volume (p < 0. 001), CSA (p < 0. 001), pennation angle (p < 0. 05), muscle thickness (p < 0. 001), fascicle length (p < 0. 001) and finger force (p < 0. 001). Changes in the shape of muscle architecture during contraction were more pronounced in men than women (p < 0. 01). The mean finger <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> for men was 96. 7 N and for women 39. 6 N. Muscle parameters related to the <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> differed between men and women. For men the muscle volume and muscle CSA were related to <b>extension</b> <b>force,</b> while for women muscle thickness was related to the <b>extension</b> <b>force.</b> Conclusion: Ultrasound is a useful tool for studying muscle architectures in EDC.

40|$|International audienceThere {{is general}} {{consensus}} that the minimization of the secondary torque of the hand provides a universal model for explaining the force sharing patterns among the fingers.

Each fingertip force was expressed in percentage of the force produced by an individual finger force over the resultant four-finger force (force sharing), and the point of force application of the resultant force was calculated (neutral line). The force-sharing pattern was different for flexion and extension. The index and ring fingers were equally involved, regardless of the task.

40|$|AbstractSingle {{molecule}} force spectroscopy {{has evolved}} into an important and extremely powerful technique for investigating the folding potentials of biomolecules. Mechanical tension is applied to individual molecules, and the subsequent, often stepwise unfolding is recorded in <b>force</b> <b>extension</b> traces. However, because the energy barriers of the folding potentials are often close to the thermal energy, both the <b>extensions</b> and the <b>forces</b> at which these barriers are overcome are subject to marked fluctuations. Therefore, <b>force</b> <b>extension</b> traces are an inadequate representation despite widespread use particularly when large populations of proteins need to be compared and analyzed. We show in this article that contour length, which is independent of fluctuations and alterable experimental parameters, is a more appropriate variable than <b>extension.</b> By transforming <b>force</b> <b>extension</b> traces into contour length space, histograms are obtained that directly represent the energy barriers. In contrast to <b>force</b> <b>extension</b> traces, such barrier position histograms can be averaged to investigate details of the unfolding potential. The cross-superposition of barrier position histograms allows us to detect and visualize the order of unfolding events. We show with this approach that {{in contrast to the}} sequential unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin, two main steps in the unfolding of the enzyme titin kinase are independent of each other. The potential of this new method for accurate and automated analysis of force spectroscopy data and for novel automated screening techniques is shown with bacteriorhodopsin and with protein constructs containing GFP and titin kinase...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} pseudo-dynamic pressure and its associated forces on a rigid vertical retaining wall is solved analytically using the horizontal slices method for both reinforced and unreinforced walls. The use of this method {{in conjunction with the}} suggested equations and unknowns offers a pseudo-dynamic method that is then compared with the results of an available software. In the proposed method, different seismic accelera-tions have been modeled at different soil structure heights. Reinforced soil pressure on a retaining wall and the angle of the critical failure wedge are calculated using the new formulation. It is shown that as the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient increases the angle of the critical failure wedge is reduced and that the maximum <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> can be increased for each layer by using stronger and longer reinforcements. The results of the pseudo-dynamic method show that both vertical and horizontal seismic accelerations are essential coefficients for calculation of the required length and <b>extension</b> <b>force</b> of the reinforcements and that their importance increases as the vertical and horizontal seismic accelerations increase. Also, the location of the application point of the resultant pressure rises as the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient increases...|$|E

A stronger necessary form of such a principle, ✷mpΓ(X), occurs when it continues to be true in all Γ <b>forcing</b> <b>extensions.</b> This study uses iterated forcing, modal logic, and other techniques to establish consistency strengths for various modified maximality principles restricted to various forcing classes, including ccc, cohen, coll (the forcing notions that collapse ordinals to ω), < κ directed closed forcing notions, etc., both with and without parameter sets. Necessary forms of these principles are also considered. Content...|$|R
