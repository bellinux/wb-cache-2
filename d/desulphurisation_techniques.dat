40|$|Common {{species that}} {{are found in the}} flue gas of many coal burning {{industries}} are sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The current flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>techniques</b> used in practice are undesirable as they are uneconomical (they have high capital and operating costs) and they generate waste. Many results in the literature show that if gold (Au) is finely divided and supported on metal oxide, it is effective as a catalyst for oxidising CO. However, there have not been many studies involving the reduction of SO 2 by CO over a gold catalyst. The main objective of this research project was to determine whether a gold catalyst supported on titania would be suitable for the reduction of SO 2 by CO. Titania (TiO 2) was used as the metal oxide support and the gold catalysts were prepared by the deposition-precipitation method. Other gold catalysts were prepared by impregnating promoter ions (K+, Na+, SO 42 -, PO 43 -) onto the TiO 2 before the gold was added. The effect of TiO 2 calcined at 400 °C without the addition of gold was also investigated for this reaction. Since this work is novel, as the reduction of SO 2 by CO has hardly been performed over this type of catalyst before, the experimental method required screening several catalysts over a range of temperatures. The method used for screening the catalysts was the temperature “stepping method” where the reaction temperature was stepped in equal intervals of 25 °C from a minimum temperature of 50 °C to a maximum of 200 °C. The results were analysed by integrating the SO 2 adsorption peaks. It was found that a gold catalyst is in fact suitable for this application. TiO 2 without gold was effective at adsorbing SO 2, although it was not as effective as the gold catalysts supported on titania. A catalyst time on stream experiment using the 0. 8 wt...|$|E
40|$|Present {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) systems demonstrate high system efficiency and impressive environmental performance, giving them {{an edge over}} conventional pulverised fuel power stations. A key area {{in the development of}} IGCCs is hot fuel gas clean-up (HGCU). Fuel gas cleaning at elevated temperatures reduces thermal efficiency losses associated with gas quenching in conventional cold gas cleaning methods. Current hot gas <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>techniques</b> focus on the use of regenerable metal oxide sorbents, however the long-term sorbent performance issues have yet to be fully addressed. A fresh and radical approach may provide the key to overcoming the inherent limitations associated with metal oxide sorbents. A molten tin irrigated packed bed scrubber adopted in this research project is one such innovative way forward in HGCU. The hot scrubber offers the prospect of a multicomponent clean-up device. High-temperature sulphur removal takes place via absorption of H 2 S (and COS) into molten tin whilst discrete molten tin droplets and rivulets on the packing surface act as solid particulate collectors. The primary aim of this research project was to investigate the workings of a small-scale room temperature packed bed scrubber operating under non-wetting flow conditions analogous to the molten tin irrigated scrubber. Water irrigation of low surface energy packings simulated the nonwetting flow of liquid metals. The air-water analogue of the liquid metal scrubber provided the platform for hydrodynamics (flow visualisation, flooding and liquid holdup), particulate removal and mass transfer studies under non-wetting flow conditions. The performance of a small air lift for water circulation through the column was also investigated. These cold studies offered insight into the operation and performance of the liquid metal hot scrubber. Prior to the cold gas scrubber studies, preliminary small-scale gasification tests on petroleum coke samples were performed to investigate the effect of molten tin on H 2 S in the product fuel gas. The tests provided actual experimental evidence of the possibility of sulphur removal by molten tin in a gasification environment. It was shown that the maximum possible size of a liquid droplet hanging from a non-wetting spherical solid surface could be predicted from the liquid surface tension and density based on force balance. The mobility of static holdup in a non-wettable packed bed has been demonstrated, this being due to the tendency for the liquid to form discrete droplets rather than spreading films. Existing flooding and liquid holdup correlations that hold for conventional wettable packed beds were shown to be inadequate where non-wetting systems were concerned. Summary hence alternative methods applicable to the latter were sought. The introduction of a non-wetting tendency factor based on the ratio of the solid critical surface tension to the liquid surface tension, enabled the flooding capacities of non-wetting systems including those of this study to be predicted using Sherwood et al. 's graphical flooding correlation. The total volumetric liquid holdup was well correlated against the bed pressure drop, true gas velocity and gas density, offering the prospects of predicting holdup for systems using the same spherical packing. In general, the water-irrigated packed bed showed good hydrodynamic similarities to liquid metal systems, suggesting a dominating influence of liquid-solid contact angle which overrides striking differences in liquid physical properties. The performance of the small air lift pump was unaffected by varying the number of gas ports on the injector without any change to the hole size. The operating curve of the air lift pump could be predicted with good accuracy using momentum balance and two phase flow theory, provided that all major pressure losses in the system were accounted for, including notably the downcomer friction losses and accelerative effects. The non-wetting packed bed scrubber demonstrated impressive dust removal performance. Total separation efficiencies as high as 99. 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} kinetics and diffusion behaviour {{of methane}} steam reforming {{have been investigated}} in this work. Measurements of effective diffusivities of the gases present in methane steam reforming {{have been carried out}} by using the steady-state technique over wide ranges of temperature and pressure in a modified Wicke-Kallenbach (W-K) type diffusion apparatus. The effects of diffusion limitation on the reactions were examined at atmospheric pressure in a pellet reactor; and the intrinsic kinetics of methane steam reforming have been studied on a commercial nickel/alumina catalyst (ICI 57 - 4) in an integral reactor. A simulation study has been carried out {{to determine the effects of}} hydrogen removal on the performance of a membrane reactor and the catalyst activity for methane steam reforming. For the measurements of effective diffusivities, the temperature and pressure dependencies of effective diffusivities of gases measured have been obtained, and the tortuosities of pellets used for the gases measured have been estimated by using the parallel path pore model. At ambient pressure, the temperature exponent values range from 1. 0 to 1. 25. This indicates that the diffusion occurs in the transition region. At pressures up to 1 MPa, the diffusion lies mainly in the bulk diffusion region. The pressure exponent was generally less than 1. 0 with values lying between 0. 4 and 0. 85 except for gas-water vapour pairs where it is close to 1. 0. The tortuosities estimated for the pellets varied from 1. 84 to 2. 51 for different gases at ambient pressure, but decreased with increase in pressure. Using the pellet reactor that couples the diffusion and reaction for methane steam reforming, experimental results, which were obtained over catalyst pellets without holes, show that the diffusion rate of methane into the catalyst pellets almost totally controlled the reaction rate. Under such diffusion limitation, other conditions did not show any apparent effects on the reaction. For catalyst pellets that contained four holes, the diffusion limitation on reaction was considerably reduced. However, catalyst activity did not play an important role in affecting the reaction. It was found that the effects of diffusion limitation on the catalyst pellet with a higher activity are greater than on catalyst pellet with a lower activity. For the study of the intrinsic kinetics of methane steam reforming, the effects of temperature, pressure, and ratio of steam/methane on reactions have been investigated experimentally under condition of no diffusion limitation. The effects of total pressure on initial reaction rates indicated that the rate controlling steps of steam reforming are surface reactions between adsorbed species. The experimental results confirmed that both CO and CO 2 are primary products of steam reforming. Six detailed reaction mechanisms were considered by combining different adsorption behaviour of methane and steam on the nickel catalyst. For methane steam reforming, accompanied by water gas shift on the catalyst used, intrinsic rate equations were derived by using the Langmuri-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LH-HW) approach and Freundlich's non-ideal adsorption concept. Applying the method of parameter estimation and model discrimination, the new model was determined and the parameters in this model were determined as statistically significant and thermodynamically consistent. The influence of hydrogen removed on the catalyst deactivated by hydrogen sulphide poisoning and carbon formation has been simulated for methane steam reforming in a tubular catalytic reactor with a hydrogen permeable wall. The effects of the main variables on H 2 S tolerance and the tendency to carbon formation on the catalyst have been investigated. The simulation demonstrated that the hydrogen removed by the membrane may cause more extensive catalyst deactivation with the H 2 S tolerance decreasing and the tendency to carbon formation increasing as the proportion of hydrogen removal increased. The simulation also showed that the benefit of using a membrane reactor may not be achieved for feedstocks with a high H 2 S level when a high proportion of hydrogen is removed. A higher applied pressure and a more efficient <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>technique</b> need to be employed to compensate for the influence of significant hydrogen removal on the catalyst activity for methane steam reforming in a membrane reactor operated at low temperatures...|$|R
