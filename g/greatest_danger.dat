5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 7 September 1191, as Richard's forces {{began moving}} out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions, hinting that Saladin's whole army lay hidden in the woodland. King Richard took especial pains over the {{disposition}} of his army. The probable posts of <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E

5|$|In March 1937, {{the then}} Director of Operations Group Captain Robert Saundby, {{complained that the}} role for Coastal Command in war, namely {{supporting}} the bomber offensive, and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and {{was in danger of}} diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the decision to have strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence. Coastal Command was only to be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. However, in December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again, and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> {{to people}} from moose is car {{collision}}s.

25|$|Their mission {{required}} the vessels to pass between German-occupied territories in waters habitually patrolled by German aircraft and surface vessels. To minimise {{the risk of}} detection, the Navy timed the voyages to pass areas of <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> during the hours of darkness.

The adults soften the shock by teaching the children to feel privileged to belong to such a secret society.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the tunnel}} penetrates a fault likely to slip, the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> to tunnels is a {{landslide}} blocking an entrance.

Where only small- to medium-sized rocks and boulders are expected to fall, the entire slope may be covered with wire mesh, pinned down to the slope with metal rods. This is also a common modification to highway cuts where appropriate conditions exist.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II {{and the establishment of}} the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: “Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity.“ The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.|$|E
25|$|The five boats, {{including}} Gay Corsair, {{were deployed}} in September 1943, with their voyages timed to pass areas of <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> during {{the hours of}} darkness. On arriving at the Swedish port of Lysekil they would load their cargoes, before sailing back to the Humber. Each leg of the journey took two days. The first attempt had to be postponed after problems developed with the boats' engines, and when it took place only Gay Viking made a successful round-trip. Further attempts were made, many of them successfully, despite some losses to the flotilla. Gay Corsair eventually made three trips, despite damaging her centre engine crankshaft on 6 March 1944. The operation was considered a success, but the trips were brought to an end {{with the return of}} the shorter nights in 1944. The voyages to Sweden were resumed in September 1944 under the name of Operation Moonshine, and involved carrying supplies and munitions to elements of the Danish resistance. Poor weather caused the cancellation of many of these attempts however.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{report for}} DEFRA, {{conducted}} following the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, found that, discounting 'exotic {{events such as}} meteorite impacts', 'in most plausible circumstances {{it is likely that}} such an event would be contained by current defences, designed to resist storm surges, for all major developed areas', however the joint occurrence of events, such as a tsunami coinciding with a storm surge, was discounted. The report did, however call for additional more detailed modelling to be carried out, recommended that the Met Office should provide a tsunami warning service, and that detection devices should be upgraded. A follow-up report indicated that, of the three likely scenarios modelled, a Lisbon-type event would pose the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> potentially resulting in a tsunami wave exceeding the 1:100 year extreme sea level at the Cornish peninsula by up to 1.4m, but being within the range elsewhere. This conclusion is markedly different from the greater heights calculated by Bryant and Haslett as having been encountered in the Bristol Channel during the 1607 Bristol Channel floods.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the offensive, British troops {{continued}} to fall back, losing their last footholds on the original front line. Thick fog impeded operations and did not disperse until early afternoon. Isolated engagements took place as the Germans pressed forward and the British held their posts, often not knowing who was to either side of them. Brigade and battalion control over events was absent. It was a day of stubborn and often heroic actions by platoons, sections and even individuals isolated from their comrades by the fragmented nature of the battle and lack of visibility. The <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> facing the British on 22 March was that the Third and Fifth armies might become separated. Byng did not order a retirement from the Flesquières salient, which his army had won at such cost and Haig ordered him to keep in contact with the Fifth Army, even if that required a further retreat; the day also saw the first French troops enter the battle on the southern flank.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day, Gebhard wrote {{also to the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, {{presenting}} his case: [...] "Verily, the Roman Antichrist moves every stone to oppress us and our churches...." [...] Two days later, he wrote a more lengthy letter to the Queen: [...] "We therefore humbly pray your Majesty to lend us 10,000angelots, and to send it speedily, that we may preserve our churches this winter from {{the invasion of the}} enemy; for if we lost Bonn, they would be in the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> while if God permits us to keep it, we hope, by his grace, that Antichrist and his agents will be foiled in their damnable attempts against those who call upon the true God." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly, the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) was a five-member {{committee}} {{established by}} the McCarran Internal Security Act in 1950, which had a mandate, similar to HUAC and inspired by McCarthy, to locate and investigate so-called [...] "subversives", or those sympathetic to the Communists. They were accused of promoting {{the establishment of a}} [...] "totalitarian dictatorship" [...] in the United States. President Truman vetoed the act, sending Congress a lengthy veto message in which he criticized specific provisions as [...] "the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798," [...] and called it a [...] "mockery of the Bill of Rights" [...] and a [...] "long step toward totalitarianism"; his veto was overridden. SACB was active for 18 years (1950-1968), but the Supreme Court did not rule all sections of the law were unconstitutional until 1993.|$|E

500|$|During the Peninsular War, the 52nd {{fulfilled}} their {{dual role}} as line and light infantry by contributing to fortress assault parties. The companies {{that led the}} breach assaults were known as the [...] "Forlorn Hope", (from the Dutch [...] "verloren hoop" [...] (lost troop)). It was deemed an act of high honour, since the lead troops faced the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger.</b> The 52nd contributed to the Forlorn Hope at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz (1812) and San Sebastian. Officers and sergeants who survived would be very likely be put up for battlefield promotions (although it was not assured) while other ranks would receive laurels from their commander also with the chance of promotion being greatly increased. The 52nd, however, offered its own recognition: those who survived the Forlorn Hope at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were entitled to wear on their right arm a badge displaying a laurel wreath and the letters [...] "V.S." [...] for [...] "Valiant Stormer". This honour was awarded by the 52nd's commanding officer, and was restricted to the 52nd.|$|E
500|$|Being {{aware that}} an over-rash pursuit was the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> when {{fighting}} armies {{trained in the}} fluid tactics of the Turks, Richard halted the charge after about [...] had been covered. The right flank Crusader units, which had formed the van of the column, including the English and Normans {{had not yet been}} heavily engaged in close combat, and they formed a reserve on which the rest regrouped. Freed from the pressure of being actively pursued, many of the Ayyubid troops turned to cut down those of the knights who had unwisely drawn ahead of the rest. James d'Avesnes, the commander of one of the Franco-Flemish units, was the most prominent of those killed in this episode. [...] Amongst the Ayyubid leaders who rallied quickly and returned to the fight was Taqi al-Din, Saladin's nephew. He led 700 men of the Sultan's own bodyguard against Richard's left flank. Once their squadrons were back in order, Richard led his knights in a second charge and the forces of Saladin broke once again.|$|E
500|$|Mindful of {{the lessons}} of the {{disaster}} at Hattin, Richard knew that his army's greatest need was water and that heat exhaustion was its <b>greatest</b> <b>danger.</b> [...] Although pressed for time he proceeded at a relatively slow pace. He marched his army only in the morning before the heat of the day, making frequent rest stops, always beside sources of water. [...] The fleet sailed down the coast in close support, a source of supplies and a refuge for the wounded. [...] Aware of the ever-present danger of enemy raiders and the possibility of hit-and-run attacks, he kept the column in tight formation with a core of twelve mounted regiments, each with a hundred knights. [...] The infantry marched on the landward flank, covering the flanks of the horsemen and affording them some protection from missiles. [...] The outermost ranks of the infantry were composed of crossbowmen. On the seaward side was the baggage and also units of infantry being rested from the continuous harassment inflicted by Saladin's forces. Richard wisely rotated his infantry units to keep them relatively fresh.|$|E
