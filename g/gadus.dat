5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it {{is not related to}} the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (<b>Gadus)</b> species. The Murray cod {{is an important part of}} Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.|$|E

25|$|Cod {{fisheries}} are fisheries for cod. Cod is {{the common}} name for fish of the genus <b>Gadus,</b> belonging to the family Gadidae, and this article is confined to the three species that belong to this genus: the Atlantic cod, the Pacific cod and the Greenland cod.|$|E
25|$|A similar cascade {{occurred}} in the Baltic Sea {{at the end of}} 1980s. After a decline in Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> morhua), the abundance of its main prey, the sprat (Sprattus sprattus), increased and the Baltic Sea ecosystem shifted from being dominated by cod into being dominated by sprat. The next level of trophic cascade was a decrease in the abundance of Pseudocalanus acuspes, a copepod which the sprat prey on.|$|E
25|$|In one {{laboratory}} study, Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> morhua) given {{access to}} an operant feeding machine learned to pull a string to get food. However, the researchers had also tagged the fish by threading a bead {{in front of their}} dorsal fin. Some fish snagged the string with their bead, resulting in food delivery. These fish eventually learned to swim in a particular way to repeatedly make the bead snag the string and get food. Because the fish used an object external to their body in a goal-oriented way, this satisfies some definitions of tool use.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of cod (<b>Gadus</b> morhua) and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.|$|E
25|$|Cods of {{the genus}} <b>Gadus</b> have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the gill cover (i.e. the throat region), {{in front of the}} {{pectoral}} fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin barbel. The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, {{to the base of the}} caudal or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> morhua), which {{lives in the}} colder waters and deeper sea regions {{throughout}} the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (<b>Gadus</b> macrocephalus), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific. <b>Gadus</b> morhua was named by Linnaeus in 1758. (However, G. morhua callarias, a low-salinity, nonmigratory race restricted to parts of the Baltic, was originally described as <b>Gadus</b> callarias by Linnaeus.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Some fish {{commonly}} known as cod are unrelated to <b>Gadus.</b> Part of this name confusion is market-driven. Severely shrunken Atlantic cod stocks {{have led to the}} marketing of cod replacements using culinary names of the form [...] "x cod", according to culinary rather than phyletic similarity. The common names for the following species have become well established; note that all inhabit the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|Cod forms part of {{the common}} name of many other fish no longer {{classified}} in the genus <b>Gadus.</b> Many {{are members of the}} family Gadidae; others are members of three related families within the order Gadiformes whose names include the word [...] "cod": the morid cods, Moridae (100 or so species); the eel cods, Muraenolepididae (four species); and the Eucla cod, Euclichthyidae (one species). The tadpole cod family (Ranicipitidae) has now been placed in Gadidae.|$|E
2500|$|At {{various times}} in the past, taxonomists {{included}} many species in [...] the genus <b>Gadus.</b> Most of these are now either classified in other genera, or have been recognized as simply forms of one of three species. All these species {{have a number of}} common names, most of them ending with the word [...] "cod", whereas other species, as closely related, have other common names (such as pollock and haddock). [...] However, many other, unrelated species also have common names ending with cod. The usage often changes with different localities and at different times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fisheries}} {{have been}} and still {{are the most important}} economic activity in Hovden. Several different fisheries are important, but the most significant are the winter-fisheries between Christmas and Easter. [...] These fisheries are also known under the name Lofotfisket. The Cod, <b>gadus</b> morhua migrate from the Barents Sea to spawn along the coast of Lofoten and have to pass Vesterålen on its way. Hovdens location is excellent given the short way to the areas where the fish are migrating south and northbound. For people living in Hovden, 80% of the total income was made during {{the first quarter of the}} year. The abundance of fish was far too much for consumption, and the fish was turned into dried fish and later salt fish, and then exported via Bergen to Europe.|$|E
