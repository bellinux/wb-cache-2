30|$|The {{intensity}} of river water pollution in Dhaka {{and the addition}} of new pollution parameters in each year hinder the city from changing to surface water source from ground water source. Already 82  % of water supply in Dhaka has been generated from groundwater through 659 <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> and the rest of 18  % is supplied from surface water. The water table in the city area has sunk by 50 m in the past four decades, and the closest underground water is now over 60 m below ground level in dry summer period. Now, <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> fail to draw groundwater, and it makes huge public chaos due to unavailability of water supply. The average water usage in a city like Dhaka is estimated around 140 l per person per day, by which only 30 l of these is used for drinking, cooking, toilet and urinal purposes. The remaining 110 l is mainly considered as ‘sullage’ which can be described as wastewater that arises as a by-product of daily human activities such as showering, washing dishes, and doing the laundry. It’s estimated that up to 80 % of all household wastewater is sullage. As such, we focused on the reuse of the said 110 l of water hoping that it will contribute in resolving the water crisis of Dhaka [9 – 11].|$|R

PSF is popular option of potable water supply in coastal problem areas. Although modified PSF has not been implemented in this area. Mainly due to high contents of Arsenic and Iron in shallow tube-well and salinity in <b>deep</b> <b>tube-well,</b> people prefer PSFs which treats surface water. In studied area the water quality parameters from PSFs are not fully satisfactory. Although removal efficiency of PSFs of Color, Turbidity is somewhat satisfactory but TC, E. Coli, suspended solids are less; {{this is due to}} lack of proper management & operation of Pond Sand Filter and pond. Performance assessment of PSFs was done in terms of quality of filtrated water and pond water. In this study six PSFs and six ponds are taken into account. Field visit shows among the studied six ponds, three ponds are badly managed and other three ponds are managed nicely. Besides number of PSFs compared to population is less so it hardly meets the demand of the people. Due to lack of technical knowledge and awareness, these PSFs are not performing well. This study aims at present {{drinking water}} pattern and scopes, people’s perception about PSF, performance analysis of existing PSFs and to address the associated problem in PSFs and pond management.

A study was undertaken to examine the changes in water and soil salinity over the period from February to April, 2014 at Kalapara upazila of Patuakhali district. Water samples were periodically collected from lake, pond, earthen well, <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> (5, 15 and 30 km away from the sea) and rivers (Tulatoli, Khaprabhanga, Sonatala and Andharmanik). Soil sampling was done from different crop fields (mustard, sweet gourd, potato, chilli, Khira-cucumber) and water melon and also from Sonatala and Andharmanik River flooded soils inside and outside polders. The electrical conductivity (EC) value of lake and pond waters was below 4 dS/m showing quite safe for irrigation while the EC value of earthen well exceeded 4 dS/m which are suitable in April. Water salinity of <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> (DTWs) increased as the DTW was closer to the sea, however all EC values were below 4 dS/m that suitable for irrigation, but not suitable for drinking purpose. Salinity level of all rivers tended to rise with the advancement of drying period, and for all dates of sampling, the EC value showed more than 4 dS/m. Soil salinity varied between inside and outside polder, and between mustard and sweet gourd fields, the higher EC values were observed outside polder and in the sweet gourd field. Soil EC levels were all above 4 dS/m particularly in April, crops showed varying degrees of leaf injury depending on the types of crops and extent of soil salinity. The EC values were positively correlated with Na and K contents of soil <br/...|$|R

The Asian Arsenic Network (AAN) and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have provided some interventions such as installation of <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> and As-Fe removal plants and awareness program to reduce drinking water As exposure of people living in the village. But scope exists for food crops grown in this area to accumulate As from As contaminated irrigation water. With these points in view, a household food survey was made to investigate As intake by the people living in Marua village. For it, cooked meals and uncooked foods were collected from households and local market. The study revealed that an adult consumed 220 µg As per day from food source and rice alone contributed 86 % of it. Considering 80 % inorganic As in rice, 220 µg total As is equivalent to 176 µg As which exceeds the WHO’s provisional maximum tolerable daily intake of As which is 2 µg/kg body weight i. e. 120 µg As for a 60 kg person. This result suggests that next to drinking water, food (mainly rice) is the principal source of As entry into human body in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{electrical}} and electromagnetic surveys {{were carried out}} in hard rock areas of Purulia district (West Bengal), India, for delineation of groundwater-bearing zones that would be suitable for construction of <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> for large amounts of water. Groundwater movement that occurs through fractures in hard rocks is suitable to be delineated by very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic surveys. A detailed survey of the area was done using a VLF-WADI instrument and appropriate locations were selected for further study using Schlumberger resistivity sounding. Hence, the entire area was surveyed {{in a relatively short}} time by the combined use of resistivity and electromagnetic surveys. Areas showing VLF anomalies {{may or may not be}} appropriate for drilling tube-wells. In the northern part of the area, fracture zones are shallow, as exhibited by the small magnitude of VLF anomalies and by shallow conducting structures interpreted from the resistivity data. A VLF survey and subsequent resistivity sounding at suitable locations suggest the existence of deep groundwater sources in the southern part of the area. VLF anomalies have shown larger magnitudes in the southern part of the area than those in the northern part of the area. Self-potential and resistivity profiling data also showed correlation with results obtained using VLF and resistivity sounding. A typical variation in self-potential (SP) anomaly, i. e. positive SP anomaly for low resistivity, was observed near the locations found suitable and could be interpreted as the result of potential developed due to streaming of fluid within the fractured rocks. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture is {{the single}} most driving force of Pakistan economy, with its share of 20. 9 percent to the countryâ€™s GNP. Whereas Sindhâ€™s {{contribution}} to Pakistanâ€™s agriculture constitutes major products, such as cotton, sugarcane, rice, wheat, and livestock. Pakistanâ€™s economic development is directly linked with the progress of agriculture and efficient management of water resources used for irrigation purposes. This research confirms that {{over the past several years}} the irrigation system has under-performed due to factors such as high cost to government; declining economic efficiency; problems relating to the design, construction and operation and maintenance (O & M) low cost recovery, and the lack of good governance. It Due to these factors the Government of Pakistan realized to implement a Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach through the involvement of water users (i. e. farmers) in managing irrigation and drainage system at secondary and tertiary levels. Over past 10 years, like many other developing countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Turkey, and Chile, farmer participation has become an important and evolving component of irrigation and drainage management in Pakistan. Out of the four provinces of, Pakistan the devolution process of irrigation reforms and management transfer has become significant in Sindh LBOD is one such project, cost and maintenance. This research investigates to confirm whether the farmers have socio-economically benefited through farmer participation process. The research also highlights the issues relating mainly to governance in the irrigation and drainage sector in Pakistan that poses threats to the viability of farmer participation. Further, this study aimed at examining the extent of accomplishment of the under-going comprehensive institutional reform process including maintenance & operations of irrigation infrastructure. The study is scientifically designed and is based on multi-staged sampling, with clusters pertaining to drainage types and target farmers. Total number of all drains (i. e. <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells,</b> scavenger wells, interceptor drains and tile drains) were stratified by their type in the project component areas(i. e. Nawabshah, Sanghar, and Mirpurkhas). Using sampling methods based on probability proportion to size, weighting technique were used to select sample of drainage in each project component. While selecting number of sample drains in each drain type, a careful approach was applied to ensure that representative number was included in the sample. For this, the sample was chosen by using a ratio of approximately 4. 9 percent out of total drain types in the LBOD project area. Analysis of key variables such as the cropping intensities, cultivation patterns, and crop use by types of drainage and seasons, reveals that cropping intensities remained higher in Rabi season as compared to Kharif. Wheat in Rabi and cotton in Kharif dominates in terms of area cultivated under these crops. These crops are further followed by rice and sugarcane. Data also shows that all three drainage modes have substantially contributed towards cultivation of crops in the area. Data also shows that current performance of drainage facilities, including <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells,</b> scavengers, interceptors and tile drains, has increasingly raised questions as to the reliability of irrigation supplies and control of salinity and water logging objectives of the LBOD project are concerned. It is argued that drainage is as necessary as irrigation for land cultivation, control of salinity and water logging, and soil fertility. Thus, application of drainage techniques for controlling salinity and water logging as well as maintaining irrigation supplies through sub-surface and vertical (tube-well) drainage types are necessary to address a number of issues, such as controlling water-table depths, ground water quality, soil improvement, and crop yields enhancement. The study also shows that lack of water, salinity and water logging and soil fertility have adversely affected the land cultivation patterns, cropping intensity, cropping output and crop incomes earned by the farmers. On the whole, crop production in the LBOD area is badly affected by the factors, mentioned above. For example, the average yield of rice (i. e. metric ton/ hectare) is about 38 percent less in the study area as compared to Sindh Province. Similarly, the yields of wheat and cotton (i. e. metric ton/hectare) are about 35 and 34 percent respectively below the provincial average. The study concludes that farmer participation is a practical solution for improving the performance of LBOD installations. It is also observed through this research that along with planning and implementation dimensions of the LBOD project, the farmers be given required training, assistance and technical know how to takeover the responsibility of operation and maintenance (O&M). Study shows that 60 : 40 percent ratio of distributing resources generated through abiana would only effectively work if farmers are provided with adequate powers to use resources for O&M. Presently, this ratio is only on paper none of the FOs currently are in a position to utilize their 40 percent share of abiana independently...|$|R
40|$|Hard rock {{aquifers}} for {{the purpose}} of this Paper mean the non-carbonate, fractured rock aquifers in the terrain covered by crystalline basement complex, metamorphic rocks and also by extensive effusive volcanic rocks like the basalts of western India (Deccan traps. Ground water development in hard rock aquifer areas has always played a secondary role compared to that in the areas having high-yielding unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments and carbonate rocks. This has been due to the relatively poor ground water resources in hard rocks, low specific capacity of wells, erratic variations and discontinuities in the aquifer properties, and difficulties in exploration and assessment of the resource. It should, however, be remembered that for the millions of farmers in developing countries, having their small farms in the barren landscape of fractured hard rock terrain, whatever small supply available from these poor aquifers is the only hope for upgrading their standard of living by growing irrigated crops or by protecting their rain-fed crops from the vagaries of rainfall. It is also their only source for drinking water for the family and cattle. In many developing countries, hard rock hydrogeologists have therefore, an important role to play. In the developed countries, the interest in hard rock hydrogeology, apart from drinking water supplies to small communities, is recently promoted by the prospects of using these low permeability rocks for the storage of hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes. The study of ground water flow through faults, fissures and fractures is also of interest to scientists studying the migration of contaminants. Hard rock hydrogeologists, the world over, are therefore divided into two main groups: Those interested in obtaining ground water for domestic, irrigational or industrial use by exploring fractured and permeable zones in a relatively less permeable matrix of hard rock and those interested in locating impermeable or the least permeable zones for storage of hazardous nuclear waste. Ironically, for the first group even the most permeable zones are often not good enough to yield adequate water supply, while for the second group even the least permeable zones are often not good enough for safe storage of hazardous nuclear waste over a prolonged period of a few hundred years. This Paper discusses the occurrence of ground water and the precautions for sustainable development of ground water in arid and semi-arid regions, in view of the forthcoming climatic changes. It emphasizes the need for recharge augmentation hand-in-hand with development of new wells, so that the new development does not harm the traditional practices. In India, the neglect of recharge augmentation has caused lowering of water table and drying-up of old dug-wells of 12 m to 15 m depth, which used to provide irrigational and drinking water supply for last several centuries. In Iran, many Qanats have dried up because of lowering of water table due to heavy pumping of ground water from newly developed <b>deep</b> <b>tube-wells</b> in their vicinity. The goal in many countries has, therefore, shifted from ground water development to ground water management which includes management of the quantity on Supply side and Demand side and also the management of ground water quality, especially with respect to pollution and salt water intrusion. Pollution of ground water in urban environment is becoming a cause of worry because in many developing countries there is a heavy migration of population from rural areas to urban centers and providing safe quality of drinking water to this population and managing the waste water generated in the cities and towns, is a major problem. The role of UNESCO-IUGS-IGCP Project GROWNET (Ground Water Network for Best Practices in Ground Water Development in Low Income Countries) is also described towards the end of this Paper.
