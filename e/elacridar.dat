40|$|Objective: A novel tablet {{formulation}} containing an {{amorphous solid}} dispersion (ASD) of <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride was developed {{with the purpose}} to resolve the drug’s low solubility in water and to conduct proof-of-concept clinical studies. Significance: <b>Elacridar</b> is highly demanded for proof-of-concept clinical trials that study the drug’s suitability to boost brain penetration and bioavailability of numerous anticancer agents. Previously, clinical trials with <b>elacridar</b> were performed with a tablet containing <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride. However, this tablet formulation resulted in poor and unpredictable absorption which {{was caused by the}} low aqueous solubility of <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride. Methods: Twenty four different ASDs were produced and dissolution was compared to crystalline <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride and a crystalline physical mixture. The formulation with highest dissolution was characterized for amorphicity. Subsequently, a tablet was developed and monitored for chemical/physical stability for 12 months at + 15 – 25 [*]°C, + 2 – 8 [*]°C and − 20 [*]°C. Results: The ASD powder was composed of freeze dried <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride–povidone K 30 –sodium dodecyl sulfate (1 : 6 : 1, w/w/w), appeared fully amorphous and resulted in complete dissolution whereas crystalline <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride resulted in only 1 % dissolution. The ASD tablets contained 25 [*]mg <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride and were stable for at least 12 months at – 20 [*]°C. Conclusions: The ASD tablet was considered feasible for proof-of-concept clinical studies and is now used as such...|$|E

Friend leukemia virus strain B mice were administered 100 mg/kg <b>elacridar</b> either orally or intraperitoneally. The absolute bioavailability of <b>elacridar</b> after oral or intraperitoneal dosing was determined with respect to an intravenous dose of 2. 5 mg/kg. At these doses, the absolute bioavailability was 0. 22 for oral administration and 0. 01 for intraperitoneal administration. The terminal half-life of <b>elacridar</b> was approximately 4 h after intraperi-toneal and intravenous administration and nearly 20 h after oral dosing. The brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp,brain) of <b>elacridar</b> increased as plasma exposure increased, suggesting saturation of the efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier. The Kp,brain after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral dosing was 0. 82, 0. 43, and 4. 31, respectively. The low aqueous solubility and high lipophilicity of <b>elacridar</b> result in poor oral absorption, most likely dissolution-rate-limited. These results illustrate the importance of the route of administration and the resultant plasma exposure in achieving effective plasma and brain con-centrations of <b>elacridar</b> and can be used as a guide for future studies involving <b>elacridar</b> administration and in developing for-mulation strategies to overcome the poor absorption...|$|E
40|$|Many anticancer {{drugs have}} an {{impaired}} bioavailability and poor brain penetration {{because they are}} substrates to drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein. <b>Elacridar</b> is a strong inhibitor of these two drug efflux pumps and therefore has great potential to improve oral absorption and brain penetration of many anticancer drugs. Currently, a clinical formulation of <b>elacridar</b> is unavailable and therefore the pharmaceutical development of a drug product is highly warranted. This also necessitates the availability of an analytical method for its quality control. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection was developed for the pharmaceutical quality control of products containing <b>elacridar</b> as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The analytical method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, selectivity, carry-over, stability of stock and reference solutions, stability of the final extract, stability-indicating capability and impurity testing.

40|$|The study {{objective}} was to investigate factors that affect {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) distribution of <b>elacridar.</b> <b>Elacridar</b> inhibits transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and has been used to study the influence of transporters on brain distribution of chemother-apeutics. Adequate distribution of <b>elacridar</b> across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and into the brain parenchyma is necessary to target tumor cells in the brain that overexpress transporters and reside behind an intact BBB.

Treatment of glioblastoma with new molecularly-targeted agents {{has been largely}} ineffective in clinical trials. Many of these molecularly-targeted agents are substrates for the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP, and therefore, {{one of the reasons}} for the lack of efficacy could be the limitations to drug delivery to the target site. P-gp and BCRP are efflux transporters that are expressed at the blood-brain barrier, which acts as a protective mechanism and prevents chemotherapeutics from reaching the brain parenchyma. P-gp and BCRP are also expressed at the tumor cell surface. These two sequential barriers could restrict the access of chemotherapeutics to the target site and therefore could reduce their efficacy. The main objective of this work was to overcome these sequential barriers by use of a pharmacological inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, <b>elacridar.</b> The ultimate aim was to develop a chronic dosage regimen of a molecularly-targeted agent with <b>elacridar</b> as an adjuvant to enhance drug delivery to the brain in preclinical models of glioma. We demonstrated that the bioavailability of <b>elacridar</b> is limited due to its poor physicochemical properties. We also showed that the distribution of <b>elacridar</b> into the brain is limited by the presence of P-gp and BCRP and is governed by a saturable efflux process that can be overcome by increasing the dose of <b>elacridar.</b> We developed a microemulsion formulation of <b>elacridar</b> that improved its bioavailability several-fold and allowed us to decrease the dose of <b>elacridar</b> required to show an inhibitory effect. We examined the effect of <b>elacridar</b> as an adjuvant to erlotinib in treatment of tumor-bearing mice. It was found that while the co-administration of <b>elacridar</b> definitely improved the brain distribution of erlotinib, it did not offer any advantage in improving overall survival of the tumor bearing animals. These observations show that improving the distribution of a single molecularly targeted agent may not be sufficient in order to effectively target a heterogenous tumor such as glioma. To effectively treat an aggressive disease such as glioblastoma, a combination of drugs that target a number of growth pathways; combined with a pharmacological inhibitor of transporters could help formulate an effective strategy to target tumor cells...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{intestinal}} uptake of the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel {{is seriously}} hampered by drug efflux through P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and drug metabolism via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A. The resulting low oral bioavailability can be boosted by co-administration of P-gp or CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors. METHODS: Paclitaxel or docetaxel (10 [*]mg/kg) {{was administered to}} CYP 3 A 4 -humanised mice after administration of the P-gp inhibitor <b>elacridar</b> (25 [*]mg[*]kg(- 1)) and the CYP 3 A inhibitor ritonavir (12. 5 [*]mg[*]kg(- 1)). Plasma and brain concentrations of the taxanes were measured. RESULTS: Oral co-administration of the taxanes with <b>elacridar</b> increased plasma concentrations of paclitaxel (10. 7 -fold, P< 0. 001) and docetaxel (four-fold, P< 0. 001). Co-administration with ritonavir resulted in 2. 5 -fold (paclitaxel, P< 0. 001) and 7. 3 -fold (docetaxel, P< 0. 001) increases in plasma concentrations. Co-administration with both inhibitors simultaneously resulted in further increased plasma concentrations of paclitaxel (31. 9 -fold, P< 0. 001) and docetaxel (37. 4 -fold, P< 0. 001). Although boosting of orally applied taxanes with <b>elacridar</b> and ritonavir potentially increases brain accumulation of taxanes, we found that only brain concentrations, but not brain-to-plasma ratios, were increased after co-administration with both inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The oral availability of taxanes can be enhanced by co-administration with oral <b>elacridar</b> and ritonavir, without increasing the brain penetration of the taxanes...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Previously, {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} co-administration of {{paclitaxel}} with the second generation ABCB 1 (p-gp) modulator valspodar on the intracerebral growth of human U 118 -MG glioblastoma in nude mice. Valspodar significantly increased the brain levels of paclitaxel by inhibition of p-gp expressed at the blood brain barrier. Thus, the tumour burden was reduced by 90 %, which was considered as a proof of concept. However, the paclitaxel dose had to be reduced because of toxic side effects resulting from increased drug levels due to p-gp modulation in peripheral tissues. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we examined the co-application of paclitaxel with the third generation ABCB 1 modulators <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar, which were supposed to preferentially modulate p-gp in brain capillaries. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of the modulators was measured by a flow cytometric and a chemosensitivity assay in vitro. To determine the distribution of paclitaxel in vivo, nude mice received 50 mg/kg of valspodar, <b>elacridar</b> or tariquidar p. o. (control: vehicle) 4 h before i. v. injection of 8 mg/kg of paclitaxel. Brain, liver, kidney and plasma were collected and analyzed by RP-HPLC. RESULTS: Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the new modulators are about 80 times more effective in comparison to valspodar. Co-administration of paclitaxel with <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar led to a long lasting fivefold increase in the concentration of the cytostatic in the brain. Although the increase (2. 5 - to 7 -fold) tended to be lower compared to that induced by co-administered valspodar (six- to eightfold), the brain/plasma ratios achieved with the new modulators were 2 - 15 times higher. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Elacridar</b> and tariquidar seem to modulate p-glycoprotein preferentially at the blood-brain barrier. Our results suggest that the systemic toxicity of cytostatics combined with <b>elacridar</b> or tariquidar should be lower than in combination with valspodar...|$|E

40|$|Mefloquine is a chiral {{neurotoxic}} antimalarial agent showing stereoselective brain uptake {{in humans}} and rats. It is a substrate and an inhibitor of the efflux protein P-glycoprotein. We investigated the stereoselective uptake and efflux of mefloquine in mice, {{and the consequences}} of the combination with an efflux protein inhibitor, <b>elacridar</b> (GF 120918) on its brain transport. Racemic mefloquine (25 mg kg− 1) was administered intraperitoneally with or without <b>elacridar</b> (10 mg kg− 1). Six to seven mice were killed at each of 11 time-points between 30 min and 168 h after administration. Blood and brain concentrations of mefloquine enantiomers were determined using liquid chromatography. A three-compartment model with zero-order absorption from the injection site was found to best represent the pharmacokinetics of both enantiomers in blood and brain. (−) Mefloquine had a lower blood and brain apparent volume of distribution and a lower efflux clearance from the brain, resulting in a larger brain/blood ratio compared to (+) mefloquine. <b>Elacridar</b> did not modify blood concentrations or the elimination rate from blood for either enantiomers.

The efflux clearance from the brain decreased for both enantiomers, with a larger decrease for (+) mefloquine. After administration of racemic mefloquine in mice, blood and brain pharmacokinetics are stereoselective, (+) mefloquine being excreted from brain more rapidly than its antipode, showing that mefloquine is a substrate of efflux proteins and that mefloquine enantiomers undergo efflux in a stereoselective manner.

The best results were obtained for compounds 3 c and 3 a (EC(50) = 1. 64 and 4. 86 microM, respectively) and these results were remarkable because <b>Elacridar</b> showed in the same biological evaluation similar inhibitory activity (EC(50) = 2 microM). SAR studies displayed that the removal of double bond on the spacer or its shifting into tetraline ring decreased the P-gp inhibiting activity. Moreover, the P-gp inhibition mechanism of tested compounds was investigated by three selected biological experiments. The results displayed that only compound 3 c was P-gp inhibitor as <b>Elacridar,</b> while compound 3 a and reference compounds Cyclosporin A and Verapamil modulated P-gp activity saturating the efflux pump as substrates.

40|$|Chemotherapy {{of primary}} and {{secondary}} brain tumors is hampered by {{the existence of the}} blood-brain-barrier (BBB) which reduce the brain concentrations of lipophilic cytostatic agents by efflux transport proteins like p-glycoprotein 170 (p-gp). Combining cytostatic agents that are p-gp substrates with inhibitors of p-gp like valspodar is a new approach to overcome the BBB. As a model of non-small cell lung cancer metastases, intracerebral implanted human NCI-H 460 cells were treated with a combination of valspodar and vinblastine (50 mg/kg of valspodar p. o.; 0. 8 mg/kg of vinblastine i. p., every 5 day). Brain metastases of small cell lung cancer were simulated by the intracerebral injection of DMS 114 cells and treated with a combination of valspodar and paclitaxel (50 mg/kg of valspodar p. o.; 3 mg/kg of paclitaxel i. v. on day 8, and 2 mg/kg on day 15). No therapeutic benefit was observed in the intracerebral tumor models despite restoration of chemosensitivity in vitro. The high aggressiveness of NCI-H 460 cells together with the rapid cell proliferation may be the reason for the negative in vivo result. Furthermore, the increase in the vinblastine concentration in the brain, resulting from the p-gp inhibition by valspodar seemed to be extremely low. In case of intracranial DMS 114 tumors chemosensitivity of DMS 114 cells against paclitaxel seemed to be lower compared to the in vitro sensitivity. The 3 rd generation p-gp modulators <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar were characterized with respect to their activity to inhibit p-gp mediated efflux and their specificity against other ABC proteins present at the BBB like the ABCG 2 transporter. Both compounds showed an up to 80 times higher inhibitory activity against p-gp than valspodar with IC 50 values of 20. 5 nM for <b>elacridar</b> and 26. 5 nM in case of tariquidar. <b>Elacridar</b> and tariquidar are non-specific modulators as both compounds were able to inhibit not only the p-gp mediated efflux but also ABCG 2 transport. However, they differed concerning the selectivity for the two ABC transport proteins. Also, the effect of the two modulators on the paclitaxel distribution in nude mice was examined. The paclitaxel levels were detected in liver, kidney, plasma and brain of nude mice 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 24 hours after the intravenous injection of paclitaxel by HPLC. The results were compared to the paclitaxel distribution after co-administration of the 2 nd generation modulator valspodar. In contrast to valspodar, <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar distribution in the nude mice was determinable. Compared to the IC 50 values for p-gp inhibition determined in vitro, 500 to 2500 times higher <b>elacridar</b> and 100 times higher tariquidar concentrations were detected in the brain samples. Hence, sufficient modulator levels were reached for p-gp modulation at the BBB. In liver and kidney the paclitaxel concentrations were similar in the control, the <b>elacridar</b> and the tariquidar group, whereas in the valspodar group the paclitaxel concentrations were significantly higher. In the plasma of valspodar treated mice the paclitaxel levels were about 10 times higher than in the plasma of mice treated with tariquidar, <b>elacridar</b> or vehicle. The paclitaxel concentrations in the brains of the valspodar group were 5 to 8. 5 times higher than in the control group, whereas in the <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar groups an only 4 fold increase compared to the control group was measured. Compared with valspodar, the brain/plasma ratio of paclitaxel in mice treated with <b>elacridar</b> or tariquidar indicates a more specific accumulation of paclitaxel in the brain. Although the increase in paclitaxel brain concentration in case of <b>elacridar</b> and tariquidar co-administration was not as pronounced as in case of valspodar, a dose reduction of anticancer drugs, as in case of valspodar paclitaxel co-administration, seems unnecessary with new modulators, {{due to the lack of}} p-gp modulation in liver and kidney, and the low cytostatic drugs concentrations in plasma. Another method to increase intracerebral drug concentrations is the utilization of the transferrin receptor mediated transcytosis at the BBB for drug delivery to the brain. To be able to perform treatment studies with cytostatic drug loaded immunoliposomes targeted to the transferrin receptor both at the BBB and in tumor cells, a tumor model of primary brain tumors in the brain of nude rats was established. For this purpose, three human glioblastoma cell lines were examined, but only the U- 373 MG cells turned out to be suited as an orthotopic tumor model. In summary, the administration of p-gp modulators of the 3 rd generation in combination with anticancer drugs is a promising strategy for the treatment of {{primary and secondary}} brain tumors. Approaches exploiting specific transcytotic pathways at the BBB might also enhance the concentrations of cytostatic drugs in the brain, a prerequisite for a successful therapy of malignant brain tumors...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Little {{is known}} about the optimal {{clinical}} use of ABT- 888 (veliparib) for treatment of glioblastoma. ABT- 888 is a PARP inhibitor undergoing extensive clinical evaluation in glioblastoma, because it may synergize with the standard-of-care temozolomide (TMZ). We have elucidated important factors controlling ABT- 888 efficacy in glioblastoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used genetically engineered spontaneous glioblastoma mouse models and allograft models that were orthotopically transplanted into wild-type (WT) and Abcb 1 /Abcg 2 -deficient (KO) recipients. RESULTS: ABT- 888 /TMZ is not efficacious against p 53;p 16 (Ink 4 a) /p 19 (Arf);K-Ras(v 12);LucR allografts in wild-type recipients, indicating inherent resistance. Abcb 1 /Abcg 2 mediated efflux of ABT- 888 at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) causes a 5 -fold reduction of ABT- 888 brain penetration (P < 0. 0001) that was fully reversible by <b>elacridar.</b> Efficacy studies in WT and KO recipients and/or concomitant <b>elacridar</b> demonstrate that Abcb 1 /Abcg 2 at the BBB and in tumor cells impair TMZ/ABT- 888 combination treatment efficacy. <b>Elacridar</b> also markedly improved TMZ/ABT- 888 combination treatment in the spontaneous p 53;p 16 (Ink 4 a) /p 19 (Arf);K-Ras(v 12);LucR glioblastoma model. Importantly, ABT- 888 does enhance TMZ efficacy in Pten deficient glioblastoma allografts and spontaneous tumors, even in Abcb 1 /Abcg 2 proficient wild-type mice. Loss of PTEN occurs frequently in glioblastoma (36 %) and in silico analysis on patient with glioblastoma samples revealed that it is associated with a worse overall survival (310 days vs. 620 days, n = 117). CONCLUSIONS: The potential of ABT- 888 in glioblastoma can best be demonstrated in patients with PTEN null tumors. Therefore, clinical trials with ABT- 888 should evaluate these patients as a separate group. Importantly, inhibition of ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 (by <b>elacridar)</b> may improve the efficacy of TMZ/ABT- 888 therapy in all glioblastoma patients...|$|E

30|$|We {{estimated}} P-gp {{inhibition of}} quercetin and silymarin using Caco- 2 permeability assay and compared those inhibitory effects with standard strong P-gp inhibitor <b>elacridar.</b> Both quercetin and silymarin produced concentration dependent P-gp inhibitory effects on Caco- 2 cell lines {{by increasing the}} apical to basolateral transport of digoxin. We observed {{a significant change in}} the transport of digoxin with both the selected test inhibitors at 50 and 100  µM concentrations for AP-to-BL as well as BL-to-AP transport. By using quercetin as a P-gp inhibitor similar type of results were published by Zhang et al. (Zhang and Morris 2003 a). In our study, quercetin appears to be more potent than silymarin in terms of digoxin efflux ratio on Caco- 2 cell lines. Kpbrain of P-gp substrate quinidine was measured at different time point’s i.e. 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7  h in mice in the presence of <b>elacridar,</b> quercetin and silymarin. At 1  h time point, the fold increase in Kpbrain of P-gp substrate quinidine was found to be 22.5 in presence of <b>elacridar,</b> 3.5 in the presence of silymarin and 2.5 in the presence of quercetin. These results suggest that Kpbrain values varied with time of measurement and distribution kinetics of the compound. A single time point measurement could mislead the evaluation of brain penetration of P-gp substrate. Therefore, in addition to Kpbrain we also determined the brain to plasma AUC ratio (B/P).|$|E

In the present study, {{we set out to}} investigate the potency of tariquidar, a third-generation P-glycoprotein inhibitor in clinical development, for overcoming bacterial resistance towards ciprofloxacin. Methods: Staphylococcus aureus 29213 (SA 29213) and S. aureus 1199 B (SA 1199 B), which overexpresses the multidrug transporter NorA, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia BAA- 85, which expresses SmeDEF, were exposed to ciprofloxacin in the presence and absence of tariquidar or, for comparative reasons, <b>elacridar.</b> Activity of both P-glycoprotein inhibitors was evaluated by determination of MICs and time-kill curves, and by quantification of uptake of ciprofloxacin into bacterial cells. Results: Activity of tariquidar and <b>elacridar</b> was comparable for S. aureus strains, and both dose-dependently increased susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin. Highest effects were observed for SA 1199 B, where the addition of tariquidar resulted in a 10 -fold reduction of the ciprofloxacin MIC, while no effect was observed for P. aeruginosa. For S. maltophilia, <b>elacridar</b> but not tariquidar improved susceptibility. Uptake of [(14) C] ciprofloxacin and modification of susceptibility showed significant correlations (r = 0. 89, P < 0. 0001). Tariquidar had no intrinsic activity against any strain tested. Conclusions: We conclude that tariquidar has potent inhibitory effect against certain bacterial efflux pumps in vitro. Their high activity at clinically achievable concentrations might yield this class of drugs promising for future applications in infectious diseases...|$|E

The effect of in vivo P-gp inhibition of <b>elacridar,</b> silymarin and quercetin was calculated in terms of the increase in Kpbrain and brain to plasma AUC ratio in mice model. The in vitro P-gp inhibition was studied as efflux ratio of probe substrates in presence of selected inhibitors in Caco- 2 cell line.

The main {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effect of natural product based P-gp inhibitors on brain penetration of various CNS drugs which are P-gp substrates. In this study, we have evaluated the inhibitory effects of natural bioflavonoids (quercetin and silymarin) on P-gp by using digoxin and quinidine as model P-gp model substrate drugs. In vitro inhibitory effects were evaluated in Caco- 2 cell lines using digoxin as a model drug and in vivo P-gp inhibiting effect was evaluated in mice model using quinidine as model drug. The accumulation and bidirectional transport of digoxin in Caco- 2 cells was determined in presence and absence of quercetin and silymarin. <b>Elacridar</b> was used as standard P-gp inhibitor and used to compare the inhibitory effects of test compounds. The apical to basolateral transport of digoxin was increased where as basolateral to apical transport of digoxin was decreased in concentration dependent manner in the presence of <b>elacridar,</b> quercetin and silymarin. After intravenous administration of P-gp inhibitors, brain levels of quinidine were estimated using LC-MS method. Increased brain uptake was observed with quercetin (2.5 -fold) and silymarin (3.5 -fold). Though the brain penetration potential of P-gp substrates was lower than that observed in <b>elacridar,</b> both quercetin and silymarin improved plasma quinidine levels. Caco- 2 permeability studies and brain uptake indicate that both quercetin and silymarin can inhibit P-gp mediated efflux of drug into brain. Our results suggest that both silymarin and quercetin could potentially increase the brain distribution of co-administered drugs that are P-gp substrates.|$|E

With low-dose oral crizotinib (5 mg/kg), Abcb 1 a/ 1 b(-/-) and Abcb 1 a/ 1 b;Abcg 2 (-/-) mice had an approximately twofold higher plasma AUC than wild-type mice, and a markedly (~ 40 -fold) higher brain accumulation at 24 hr. Also at 4 hr, crizotinib brain concentrations were approximately 25 -fold, and brain-to-plasma ratios ~ 14 -fold higher in Abcb 1 a/ 1 b(-/-) and Abcb 1 a/ 1 b;Abcg 2 (-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. High-dose oral crizotinib (50 mg/kg) resulted in comparable plasma pharmacokinetics between wild-type and Abcb 1 a/ 1 b(-/-) mice, suggesting saturation of intestinal Abcb 1. Nonetheless, brain accumulation at 24 hr was still ~ 70 -fold higher in Abcb 1 a/ 1 b(-/-) than in wild-type mice. Importantly, oral <b>elacridar</b> coadministration increased the plasma and brain concentrations and brain-to-plasma ratios of crizotinib in wild-type mice, equaling the levels in Abcb 1 a/ 1 b;Abcg 2 (-/-) mice. Our results indicate that crizotinib oral availability and brain accumulation were primarily restricted by Abcb 1 at a non-saturating dose, and that coadministration of <b>elacridar</b> with crizotinib could substantially increase crizotinib oral availability and delivery to the brain. This principle might be used to enhance therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib against brain metastases in NSCLC patients...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the formulation method solid dispersion {{and how it}} works to resolve solubility-limited absorption of orally dosed anticancer drugs. Dissolution in water is essential for drug absorption because only dissolved drug molecules are absorbed. The problem is {{that half of the}} arsenal of orally dosed anticancer drugs are poorly soluble in water, resulting in incomplete bioavailability and high variability in blood concentrations. This ultimately can result in under- or overdosing. Dissolution-limited absorption can be addressed with the pharmaceutical formulation. A promising formulation method is the solid dispersion technique. In a solid dispersion the drug is finely dispersed in a hydrophilic excipient. The hydrophilic excipient, decreased particle size and close integration of drug-excipient increase drug dissolution, allowing higher in-vivo absorption. There are currently 27 commercially available solid dispersions, 3 of them are oral anticancer formulations, highlighting the feasibility and success. For example, vemurafenib solid dispersion formulation Zelboraf® results in 30 times increased dissolution and 5 times increased bioavailability compared to a crystalline physical mixture formulation. For this thesis, oral formulations for three different drugs were developed by using the solid dispersion technique: <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride, docetaxel and paclitaxel. <b>Elacridar</b> hydrochloride is intensively studied in oncology because of its boosting effect on the oral bioavailability and brain penetration of many anticancer drugs. The boost is caused by inhibition of drug-efflux pumps P-glycoprotein (PgP) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) which are expressed in cells such as in the gastrointestinal tract, blood-brain barrier and limit oral bioavailability and drug uptake in the central nervous system. Previous clinical trials with <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride already confirmed this boosting effect. However, further commercial development of <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride is stopped, possibly due to its challenging pharmaceutical properties: it is practically insoluble in water and the previously used clinical formulation results in poor and unpredictable absorption. This thesis describes the development and clinical evaluation of a novel oral formulation containing an <b>elacridar</b> hydrochloride solid dispersion. Docetaxel and paclitaxel are widely used against many cancer types. The oral bioavailability of these drugs is low (< 10 %) because of their poor solubility in water and presystemic metabolism. This explains why they are administered only intravenously. Intravenous administration of docetaxel and paclitaxel is burdening for the patient because hospitalization is required and dosing schedules are intensive, resulting often in toxicity. An oral formulation of docetaxel and paclitaxel has been developed previously by us. The solubility is enhanced by capsules containing a freeze dried solid dispersion of docetaxel or paclitaxel. The formulation is co-administered with presystemic metabolism inhibitor ritonavir and this results in promising clinical outcome. However, freeze drying is slow and non-continuous and results in a powder with poor flow properties, as a consequence capsules are filled manually. This production method is not suitable for further larger clinical studies with docetaxel and paclitaxel. Spray drying is a fast and continuous production process and allows better particle engineering, making it suitable for upscaling and improving powder mechanics. The pharmaceutical development and clinical evaluation of the spray dried solid dispersion for docetaxel and paclitaxel is described in this thesis...|$|E

(2012) reported a 38 fold increase in the B/P of quinidine in mice. The greater improvement of quinidine B/P with <b>elacridar</b> was {{compared with that of}} silymarin and quercetin. It was known that compounds with B/P greater than two in mdr 1 a/ 1 b KO over the wild type mice (WT) are P-gp substrates (Liu et al. 2009). In the present study, animals treated with <b>elacridar,</b> silymarin and quercetin also resulted in B/P ratio greater than two which confirms that selected inhibitors have significant impact on the brain distribution of P-substrate drugs like quinidine. Moreover, findings of Youdim et al., prove that quercetin is able to effectively traverse the BBB based on the rate of uptake in in vitro (ECV 304 /C 6 coculture) and in situ (rat, cerebral hemispheres) models. Quercetin showed measurable in vitro and in situ BBB permeability. Furthermore, quercetin showed measurable quantities inside MDCK-MDR 1 and immortalized rat brain endothelial cells (RBE 4) proving {{the fact that it is}} able to bypass the over expressed efflux transporters, which is in line with our in vivo findings (Ishisaka et al. 2011).

40|$|One of the {{classical}} protection mechanism of cancer cells involves an increased expression of drug efflux transport proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gP). P-gP is an ABC drug efflux transporter which is fisiologically express in many tissues such as the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) where it {{is involved in the}} protection of the CNS from potentially toxic agents. This protein is able to transport a wild structural different substrates, including many drugs used for a wild range of therapeutic applications. Therefore, the research of safe and effective P-gP inhibitors endowed of high selectivity and potency represent a great challenge in medicinal chemistry. In particular, the possibility to have selective molecules able to inhibit this protein could be useful to modulate the pharmacological behaviour of drugs including those used for chemo-therapy-resistant tumors. Up to now many agents modulating P-gP have been characterized including channel blockers, calmodulin antagonists, immunosuppressant and protein kinase inhibitors but all these compounds produced disappointing results in vivo because the use of high dose resulting in unacceptable toxicity. Some new drugs such as biricodar, tariquidar and <b>elacridar</b> have satisfactory inhibitory effects on P-gP. This latter displayed a high potency for P-gP transporter but it also inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCPR). On the basis of computational studies which suggested a general pharmacophore of a substrate/inhibitor of P-gP transporter, in which both a planar aromatic domain and a presence of a basic nitrogen atom within an extended side chain are described, we designed and synthesised new compounds. These molecules possessed a benzylethereal side chain substituted by aliphatic spacer of 2, 3, or 4 methylenes linked to an arylpiperazine nucleus. All the synthesized compounds have been tested in vitro to evaluated the inhibitor activity on Caco 2 cells in which P-gP is overexpressed and the best results have been obtained for compounds having a four methylene chain. Unfortunatelly, as expected, all arylpiperazine classes displayed hight serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 A and dopaminergic D 2 receptor affinities. In order to improve P-gP affinity and eliminate serotoninergic and dopaminergic activities some structural manipulations on these derivatives have been carried out such as the substitution of the aryl and arylpiperazine moieties with a methylic and tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleuses respectively. Besides new ligand series arylmethyloxyphenyl 1, 2, 3 were prepared by removing the alkylpiperazinic ring and linking arylmethyl groups directly to the phenoxyalkyl nucleous. Moreover the replacemant of the oxygen atom with a nitrogen one led to arylmethylaminophenyl 2 derivatives more potent than the oxygen-analogues, which behaved as <b>elacridar</b> but displayed a more simple structure. However, in N-methylpiperazine series the spacer length poorly influenced the P-gP inhibitory activity. On other hand, analogously to the arylpiperazine-derivatives, also within the tetrahydroisoquinoline-derivatives, the spacer elongation improved P-gP inhibitory activity. Since the limit of P-gP inhibitors such as <b>elacridar</b> is the poor selectivity toward other ABC transporters, in particular the BCRP pump, all the active compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit [3 H]-mitoxantrone, a specific BCRP substrate. The results showed that only arylmethylaminephenyl derivatives displayed a good BCRP inhibition activity. These results led us to consider the 2 -[(3 -methoxyphenylethyl) phenoxy]- fragment, present in the more selective P-gP inhibitors, the pivotal molecular basis to design novel P-gP inhibitors.

These results led us to consider the 2 -[(3 -methoxyphenylethyl) phenoxy]- fragment, present in the more selective P-gP inhibitors, the pivotal molecular basis to design novel P-gP inhibitors. All the synthesized compounds have been tested in vitro to evaluated the inhibitor activity on Caco 2 cells in which P-gP is overexpressed and the best results have been obtained for compounds having a four methylene chain. Unfortunatelly, as expected, all arylpiperazine classes displayed hight serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 A and dopaminergic D 2 receptor affinities. In order to improve P-gP affinity and eliminate serotoninergic and dopaminergic activities some structural manipulations on these derivatives have been carried out such as the substitution of the aryl and arylpiperazine moieties with a methylic and tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleuses respectively. Besides new ligand series arylmethyloxyphenyl 1, 2, 3 were prepared by removing the alkylpiperazinic ring and linking arylmethyl groups directly to the phenoxyalkyl nucleous. Moreover the replacemant of the oxygen atom with a nitrogen one led to arylmethylaminophenyl 2 derivatives more potent than the oxygen-analogues, which behaved as <b>elacridar</b> but displayed a more simple structure. However, in N-methylpiperazine series the spacer length poorly influenced the P-gP inhibitory activity. On other hand, analogously to the arylpiperazine-derivatives, also within the tetrahydroisoquinoline-derivatives, the spacer elongation improved P-gP inhibitory activity.

40|$|Although the CB 1 {{receptor}} antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant has {{positive effects}} on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors, neuropsychiatric side effects have prompted researchers to develop peripherally acting derivatives. Here, we investigated {{for a series of}} 3, 4 -diarylpyrazoline CB 1 receptor antagonists if transport by the brain efflux transporter P-gp {{could be used as a}} selection criterion in the development of such drugs. All 3, 4 -diarylpyrazolines and rimonabant inhibited P-gp transport activity in membrane vesicles isolated from HEK 293 cells overexpressing the transporter, but only the 1, 1 -dioxo-thiomorpholino analogue 23 exhibited a reduced accumulation (- 38 +/- 2 %) in these cells, which could be completely reversed by the P-gp/BCRP inhibitor <b>elacridar.</b> In addition, 23 appeared to be a BCRP substrate, whereas rimonabant was not. In rats, the in vivo brain/plasma concentration ratio of 23 was significantly lower than for rimonabant (0. 4 +/- 0. 1 vs 6. 2 +/- 1. 6, p < 0. 001). Coadministration of <b>elacridar</b> resulted in an 11 -fold increase of the brain/plasma ratio for 23 (p < 0. 01) and only 1. 4 -fold for rimonabant (p < 0. 05), confirming the involvement of P-gp and possibly BCRP in limiting the brain entrance of 23 in vivo. In conclusion, these data support the conception that efflux via transporters such as P-gp and BCRP can limit the brain penetration of CB 1 receptor antagonists, and that this property could be used in the development of peripheral antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Urinary {{excretion}} {{accounts for}} two-thirds of total elimination of uric acid {{and the remainder}} is excreted in feces. However, the mechanism of extra-renal elimination is poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism {{and the extent of}} elimination of uric acid through liver and intestine using oxonate-treated rats and Caco- 2 cells as a model of human intestinal epithelium. In oxonate-treated rats, significant amounts of externally administered and endogenous uric acid were recovered in the intestinal lumen, while biliary excretion was minimal. Accordingly, direct intestinal secretion was thought to be a substantial contributor to extra-renal elimination of uric acid. Since human efflux transporter BCRP/ABCG 2 accepts uric acid as a substrate and genetic polymorphism causing a decrease of BCRP activity is known to be associated with hyperuricemia and gout, the contribution of rBcrp to intestinal secretion was examined. rBcrp was confirmed to transport uric acid in a membrane vesicle study, and intestinal regional differences of expression of rBcrp mRNA were well correlated with uric acid secretory activity into the intestinal lumen. Bcrp 1 knockout mice exhibited significantly decreased intestinal secretion and an increased plasma concentration of uric acid. Furthermore, a Bcrp inhibitor, <b>elacridar,</b> caused a decrease of intestinal secretion of uric acid. In Caco- 2 cells, uric acid showed a polarized flux from the basolateral to apical side, and this flux was almost abolished in the presence of <b>elacridar.</b> These results demonstrate that BCRP contributes a...|$|E
