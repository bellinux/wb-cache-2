5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have dependent children or three points <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of}} the war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches.

5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills. Morton retained his seat, despite {{a significant reduction}} in his majority to 62.68%. Morton stayed in office for another year when, on 16 June 1972 he retired from politics. At the time of his departure it had been rumoured that he had been threatening to dismiss Blacktown City Council <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not stop blocking a $200 million development in Mount Druitt.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign Jews {{had become}} more {{prominent}} in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments.

5|$|Hogg found {{employment}} in a conveyancer's office in York. Percy Shelley initially planned to visit him, but changed his {{plans in the}} spring of 1811 after {{he fell in love with}} a young woman named Harriet Westbrook. Shelley had always been opposed to the institution of marriage, but he cared deeply for Harriet and feared she would leave him <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not marry. Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet's best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not authorize tribunals.|$|E

5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not pay attention, as {{the country would be}} theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E

5|$|A second-place {{finish in}} the 2001–02 FA Premier League {{entitled}} Liverpool {{to participate in the}} Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition. The third-place finish meant they entered the 2002–03 UEFA Cup. Liverpool beat Dutch team Vitesse Arnhem and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team Celtic. A 1–1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the non-Serb {{civilian}} {{population in the}} village and the surrounding area was persecuted. They were forced to flee their homes, as they would have been imprisoned, physically abused or killed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not. After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not sell. The other minority owners agreed {{to cover the costs}} of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E

5|$|Ceasefire {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1285, {{and ended with}} Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government {{in exchange for the}} evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates {{would be able to}} sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing.

Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
