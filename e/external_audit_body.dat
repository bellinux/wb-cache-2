There will be variation in how the requirement for clinical audit will be implemented across Europe, but internal assessment within units or departments, which should employ standard audit methodology, is recommended as a systematic and continuing activity with a significant annual output of departmental audit data. This should be in conjunction with an <b>external</b> clinical <b>audit</b> (or regulatory audit), which may be required by national legislation, whereby an <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>body</b> or auditors visit departments at fixed intervals.

This is currently an important issue in the UK pubic sector, where the audit commission is employing traditional IS evaluation approaches in external inspections. Using the current literature on IS evaluation, together with both previous and new case material to gain insight into IS evaluation practice, the authors argue that IS evaluation in the public sector {{is very different from the}} private sector, and that traditional IS evaluation approaches based upon economic factors are largely inappropriate in this domain and indeed can be ritualistic.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether reliance by the external auditors on the internal auditors’ work lead to a reduction in the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> cost and <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work. Two different questionnaire surveys were sent to 387 head of internal auditors and 142 external auditors of the English local authorities, yielding a response rate of 43. 9 % and 45. 0 % respectively. Findings of the study show that the external auditors in English local authorities perceived that their reliance on internal audit work has no effect on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> fees or on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work. Internal auditors in English local authorities perceived the external auditors’ reliance on their work has no effect on the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> fees but has reduced the extent of the <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> work.
