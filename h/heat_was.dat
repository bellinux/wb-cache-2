5|$|The 2010 Claxton Shield was contested {{between five}} teams from around Australia. In {{previous}} years, {{many of the}} teams had played their home games at multiple venues. This season each team held their home games at only one venue.

5000|$|Setup (2008): Eight horses race two heats of 1,640 meters. These <b>heats</b> <b>are</b> {{followed}} by a race-off, also of 1,640 meters, if necessary, i.e. if the two <b>heats</b> <b>are</b> won by different horses.|$|R

5|$|Andrei Cross participated for Barbados as {{a swimmer}} while the nation {{participated in the}} Beijing Olympics. Born on Barbados, Cross was {{affiliated}} with TeamBath, the sports organization of England's University of Bath. He was 24 {{years old when he}} participated at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 100meters breaststroke event. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. During the course of the August 9 preliminary round, Cross was placed in the third heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 1:04.57, ending up in seventh place; he defeated Uzbekistan's Ivan Demyanenko (1:05.14), but fell behind Argentina's Sergio Andres Ferreyra (1:03.65). The <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> led by Puerto Rican swimmer Daniel Velez (1:01.80) and India's Sandeep Sejwal (1:02.19). 65 athletes participated in the preliminary round, and 63 finished their races. Cross ranked 55th. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Burundi had {{one woman}} {{competing}} in swimming at the 2008 Olympics, Elsie Uwamahoro, who {{competed in the}} 50-metre freestyle. Beijing was Uwamahoro's first Olympics.

She finished ahead of Mariama Souley Bana from Niger (40.83seconds). The <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> led by Zakia Nassar from Palestine and Karishma Karki from Nepal who swam 31.97and32.35seconds, respectively.

50|$|The Earth is cooling, and the {{resulting}} heat flow generates the Earth's magnetic field through the geodynamo and plate tectonics through mantle convection. The main sources of <b>heat</b> <b>are</b> the primordial <b>heat</b> and radioactivity, although there are also contributions from phase transitions. <b>Heat</b> <b>is</b> mostly carried to the surface by thermal convection, although there are two thermal boundary layers - the core-mantle boundary and the lithosphere - in which <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> transported by conduction. Some <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> carried {{up from the bottom}} of the mantle by mantle plumes. The heat flow at the Earth's surface is about , and it is a potential source of geothermal energy.|$|R
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|Chad was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Bachir Mahamat in the 400 metres. Mahamat competed on 12 August in the second heat. He placed seventh, {{with a time of}} 48.59 seconds, some 3.44 seconds behind the winner, Bralon Taplin of Grenada. The only runner he placed ahead of in his <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> Anas Beshr of Egypt, who had been disqualified for exiting his lane on the track. Only the first three athletes from each heat progressed to the next round, and so Mahamat's Olympics ended after that single run. His time placed him in 48th place out of 50 athletes overall, based on times in the first round.|$|E
5|$|David Freeman {{competed for}} Puerto Rico at the Beijing Olympics, {{participating}} in the men's 1,500meters race.

During the August 15 qualification round, Freeman was placed in the third heat versus 12 other athletes. He finished the event in 3:39.70, placing tenth. Nicholar Kemboi of Kenya placed behind Freeman (3:41.56), while Estonia's Tildrek Nurme placed ahead of him (3:38.59). The Puerto Rican runner's <b>heat</b> <b>was</b> led by South African athlete Juan van Deventer (3:36.32) and Spain's Arturo Casado (3:36.42).

50|$|The {{enthalpy}} of condensation (or <b>heat</b> of condensation) <b>is</b> {{by definition}} {{equal to the}} enthalpy of vaporization with the opposite sign: enthalpy changes of vaporization <b>are</b> always positive (<b>heat</b> <b>is</b> absorbed by the substance), whereas enthalpy changes of condensation <b>are</b> always negative (<b>heat</b> <b>is</b> released by the substance).|$|R
40|$|Flow in a duct of {{constant}} cross section when <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> {{added to the}} flow has been investigated numerically, taking pressure waves generated by unsteady heat addition into consideration.
