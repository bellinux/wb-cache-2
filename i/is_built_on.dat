5|$|Millennium Park <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{top of a}} large {{underground}} parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had {{to be added to}} the partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these caissons had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion's foundation.|$|E

The north end by the swing bridge section is next to the rock of Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built directly onto the rock.|$|E
5|$|The campus <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{a portion}} of the Cowell Family ranch, which was {{purchased}} by the University of California in 1961. The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails.

5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E
50|$|William Casselberry House <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Germantown Pike around 1872. Comparable to the A. Everhart Casselberry stone house, it <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Glebe lands by Abraham Everhart between 1844 and 1857.|$|R
50|$|The Church of San Marco alla Maresana (St Mark's <b>on</b> Maresana) <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the hill}} in 1619. Since the 1950s, some houses for wealthy Bergamaschi have also <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Maresana.|$|R

5|$|Bristol's {{modern economy}} <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the {{creative}} media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city {{has the largest}} circulating community currency in the U.K.—the Bristol pound, which is pegged to the Pound sterling. The city has two universities, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, {{and a variety of}} artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road, rail, sea and air by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32), Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations, and Bristol Airport.|$|E
5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 {{is set in}} Ancient China {{during the}} time of the Three Kingdoms era. The game begins at the fall of the Han Dynasty, shortly before the death of Emperor Ling when the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao begun an {{uprising}} against the Empire. A number of elements in the game build on aspects of Chinese Mythology and there is a mix between fact and fiction as the game <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> the story of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Harold Krabs is {{commonly}} known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant's success <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees for use of the building's services.|$|E
50|$|Phillips {{suggests}} that American greatness in the 20th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> oil, much as British greatness in the 19th century <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> coal, and Dutch greatness before that <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{wind and water}} power. When these energy sources became scarce or were replaced with a new source, argues Phillips, these countries lost their greatness to {{the master of the}} new energy source.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other temples, which <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a flat surface, Borobudur <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a bedrock hill, 265 m {{above sea}} level and 15 m above {{the floor of the}} dried-out paleolake. The lake's {{existence}} {{has been the subject of}} intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century; Borobudur was thought to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a lake shore or even surrounded by a lake.|$|R
50|$|Various {{mills and}} {{irrigation}} works have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> Frenchman Creek. A 100 barrel roller mill <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{the east side}} of the falls in Wauneta in 1887 by Blair and Polly.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{discovered}} of a Roman road passing through the area, on the ancient route between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of England, Atherton, which <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> and around seven brooks, {{became part of the}} manor of Warrington until the Norman conquest, when it became a township or vill in the ancient parish of Leigh. Since 1974 the town {{has been part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by {{the shore of the}} lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai <b>is</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> {{what was}} once an {{archipelago}} of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age. Perhaps {{at the beginning of}} the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.|$|E
50|$|Iași, Romania, {{is claimed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> seven hills. Many other cities {{of the world have}} similar traditions, Rome and Constantinople, for instance, were said to have <b>been</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> seven hills.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 Sheikh Badr was {{incorporated}} into a larger area renamed Givat Ram. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram, the Supreme Court of Israel, and the Jerusalem International Convention Center <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land formerly belonging to the village. Claims that the Israeli Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land belonging to the village are erroneous; the Knesset <b>was</b> <b>built</b> <b>on</b> land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.|$|R
