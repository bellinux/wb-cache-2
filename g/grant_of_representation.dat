It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation,</b> that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|R

40|$|At present, many {{countries}} allow citizens or entities {{to interact with}} the government outside the telematic environment through a legal representative who is <b>granted</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>representation.</b> However, if the interaction takes place through the Internet, only primitive mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> are available, and these are mainly based on non-dynamic offline processes that do not enable quick and easy identity delegation. This paper proposes a system of dynamic delegation of identity between two generic entities that can solve the problem of delegated access to the telematic services provided by public authorities. The solution herein is based on the generation of a delegation token created from a proxy certificate that allows the delegating entity to delegate identity to another {{on the basis of a}} subset of its attributes as delegator, while also establishing in the delegation token itself restrictions on the services accessible to the delegated entity and the validity period of delegation. Further, the paper presents the mechanisms needed to either revoke a delegation token or to check whether a delegation token has been revoked.

40|$|Module is {{effective}} <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> ring in Abelian group. Linear map of module over commutative ring is morphism <b>of</b> corresponding <b>representation.</b> This definition {{is the main}} subject of the book. To consider this definition from more general point of view I started the book from consideration of Cartesian product <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> Polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> is a map of Cartesian product <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> which is a morphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> with respect to each separate independent variable. Reduced morphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> allows us to simplify the study <b>of</b> morphisms <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> However a representation has to satisfy specific requirements for existence of reduced polymomorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> It is possible that Abelian group is only Ω-algebra, such that representation in this algebra admits polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> However, today, this statement has not been proved. Multiplicative Ω-group is Ω-algebra in which product is defined. The definition of tensor product <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> Abelian multiplicative Ω-group is based on properties of reduced polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> Abelian multiplicative Ω-group. Since an algebra is a module in which the product is defined, then we can use this theory to study linear map of algebra.
