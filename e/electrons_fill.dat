5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where <b>electrons</b> <b>fill</b> up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, an {{electron}} always tends {{to fall to}} the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital {{so long as it}} does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a photon) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, <b>electrons</b> <b>fill</b> orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.|$|E
500|$|The metal is {{hard and}} brittle at most {{temperatures}} but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again {{and can be}} pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C, 787.1F) and boiling points (907°C). Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion {{and as a result}} it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not [...] flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes. Mercury has an exceptionally low melting temperature for a d-block metal. A complete explanation of this fact requires a deep excursion into quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electronic configuration where <b>electrons</b> <b>fill</b> up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d and 6s subshells. As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.|$|E

2500|$|Figure 1 is a {{simplified}} {{illustration of the}} metal’s d orbital splitting {{in the presence of}} an octahedral ligand field.

[...] Therefore, electrons will fill the lower energy t2g orbitals completely before populating the higher energy eg orbitals.
