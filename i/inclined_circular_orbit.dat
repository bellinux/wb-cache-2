We show that large stable and regular regions are present for very eccentric and inclined orbits, corresponding to libration in the Lidov-Kozai resonance.

40|$|Recent X-ray {{variability}} {{observations of}} accreting neutron stars {{may provide the}} first evidence for frame dragging effects around spinning relativistic objects. Motivated by this possibility {{and its implications for}} neutron-star structural properties, we calculate new optimal bounds on the masses, radii, and moments of inertia of slowly rotating neutron stars that show kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). These bounds are derived under minimal assumptions about the properties of matter at high densities and therefore are largely independent of the unknown equation of state. We further derive a semi-analytical upper bound on the neutron-star moment of inertia when we make no assumption for the equation of state of matter at any density. We use this upper bound to show that the maximum possible nodal precession frequency of an <b>inclined</b> <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> around a slowly spinning neutron star is nu_{NP}~ 45. 2 (nu_s/ 300 Hz) Hz, where nu_s is the spin frequency of the neutron star.

Both planar and spatial cases are examined. In the spatial problem, families of periodic orbits are obtained after analytical continuation of vertical critical orbits. The linear stability of orbits is also examined. Concerning initial conditions nearby stable periodic orbits, we obtain long-term planetary stability, while unstable orbits are associated with chaotic evolution that destabilizes the planetary system. Stable periodic orbits are of particular importance in planetary dynamics, since they can host real planetary systems. We found stable orbits up to 60 ^∘ of mutual planetary inclination, but in most families, the stability does not exceed 20 ^∘- 30 ^∘, depending on the planetary mass ratio. Most of these orbits are very eccentric. Stable <b>inclined</b> <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> or orbits of low eccentricity were found in the 4 / 3 and 5 / 2 resonance, respectively.

40|$|We present velocity-delay {{maps for}} optical H I, He I, and He II {{recombination}} lines in Arp 151, recovered by fitting a reverberation model to spectrophotometric monitoring data using the maximum-entropy method. H I response is detected {{over the range}} 0 - 15 days, with the response confined within the virial envelope. The Balmer-line maps have similar morphologies but exhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for Hgamma to Hbeta to Halpha. The He I and He II response is confined within 1 - 2 days. There is a deficit of prompt response in the Balmer-line cores but strong prompt response in the red wings. Comparison with simple models identifies two classes that reproduce these features: freefalling gas, and a half-illuminated disk with a hotspot at small radius on the receding lune. Symmetrically illuminated models with gas orbiting in an inclined disk or an isotropic distribution of randomly <b>inclined</b> <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> can reproduce the virial structure but not the observed asymmetry. Radial outflows are also largely ruled out by the observed asymmetry. A warped-disk geometry provides a physically plausible mechanism for the asymmetric illumination and hotspot features.

A hybrid TDMA/FDMA structure is suggested for a large system. Reservation ALOHA schemes are appraised in a TDMA environment and an adaptive reservation multiple access protocol is proposed and analysed {{for a wide range of}} mobile communication traffic profiles.

40|$|During {{the last}} twenty-five years, much {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} the problem of optimal orbit transfer. The problem has been conveniently divided into two categories - unlimited thrust (or acceleration) orbit transfers and limited thrust (or acceleration) orbit transfers. The unlimited thrust orbit transfers use infinite thrust, zero burn time burns and hence have also {{come to be known as}} impulsive burn orbit transfers. In general it has been found that optimal (i. e., minimum fuel, time-free) solutions to these types of transfers require two or possibly three burns. The limited thrust transfers, in contrast, do not use impulsive burns but use burns which have a finite thrust level and a nonzero burn time and, hence, are also known as finite burn orbit transfers. If our attention is restricted to finite multi-burn transfers which have burn times less than an orbital period, two classes of transfers emerge. These classes of transfers are either Geometrically Similar to the 2 -Burn Impulsive (GS 2 BI) transfers or Geometrically Similar to the 3 -Burn Impulsive (GS 3 BI) transfers. For example, if a 2 -burn impulsive solution has a perigee burn followed by an apogee burn, the GS 2 BI finite burn transfer would use one or more perigee burns followed by one or more apogee burns. Recent-studies have presented optimal solutions to GS 2 BI finite burn orbit transfers for various thrust to weight ratios. The current study presents the optimal solutions to GS 3 BI finite burn orbit transfers between a 28. 5 ° inclined low-earth orbit and a series of 63. 4 ° <b>inclined</b> <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> and a series of 63. 4 ° inclined elliptical orbits with twelve hour periods. Also presented are optimal solutions to GS 3 BI finite burn orbit transfers between 97 ° inclined high-earth orbits and a 57 ° inclined low-earth orbit. Optimal solutions are found to be bounded by a lower limit on the initial thrust to weight ratio. It is shown that as the final perigee altitude is increased, the GS 3 BI finite burn transfer degenerates to a GS 2 BI finite burn transfer much as it would for the impulsive case. Analysis of the optimal steering during various burns reveals a natural division of the steering strategies into two categories based on whether a burn results in a predominant change in the orbit size-or-the orbit plane. The similarity of these optimal steering strategies to previously obtained simple "near-optimal" steering strategies is discussed...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that the Global Navigation Satellite Systems exist in a background of complex resonances and chaotic motion; yet, the precise dynamical character of these phenomena remains elusive. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the occurrence and nature of the resonances driving these dynamics depend chiefly on the frequencies of nodal and apsidal precession and the rate of regression of the Moon&# 039;s nodes. Woven throughout the inclination and eccentricity phase space is an exceedingly complicated web-like structure of lunisolar secular resonances, which become particularly dense near the inclinations of the navigation satellite orbits. A clear picture of the physical significance of these resonances is of considerable practical interest for the design of disposal strategies for the four constellations. Here we present analytical and semi-analytical models that accurately reflect the true nature of the resonant interactions, and trace the topological organization of the manifolds on which the chaotic motions take place. We present an atlas of FLI stability maps, showing the extent of the chaotic regions of the phase space, computed through a hierarchy of more realistic, and more complicated, models, and compare the chaotic zones in these charts with the analytical estimation of the width of the chaotic layers from the heuristic Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion. As the semi-major axis of the satellite is receding, we observe a transition from stable Nekhoroshev-like structures at three Earth radii, where regular orbits dominate, to a Chirikov regime where resonances overlap at five Earth radii. From a numerical estimation of the Lyapunov times, we find that many of the <b>inclined,</b> nearly <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> of the navigation satellites are strongly chaotic and that their dynamics are unpredictable on decadal timescales...|$|R

We also illustrate how encounter maps, typically used to trace the motion of massless particles, may be modified to reproduce the gross instability seen by the numerical integrations. Such a correlation suggests promising future use of such maps to model the dynamics of more coplanar massive planet systems.
