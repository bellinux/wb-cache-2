Others say my work is a revisionist job, useful, perhaps, in stimulating debate, but otherwise too extreme to be considered reliable. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> those appraisals.|$|E

At the same time, Woo's verbal assaults present a fantasy of authority that appeals to even McBeal. [...] "She's my hero", says McBeal, [...] "she's vicious, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> almost everything she says, she treats me like dirt, and somehow she's my hero." ...|$|E
500|$|Armstrong was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the vowel system of Somali. A 2014 bibliography on the Somali language called Armstrong's paper [...] "seminal" [...] and notes she provides a more detailed description of Somali vowels than other works. She was also the first to discuss vowel harmony in Somali; her vowel harmony analysis was praised by Italian Somalist [...] Australian British linguist Roy Clive Abraham wrote that he agreed with Armstrong on most parts regarding Somali phonetics: [...] "there are very few points where <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> her". Austro-Hungarian linguist Werner Vycichl wrote that Armstrong's study [...] "opens a new chapter of African studies". In 1992, Trinity College, Dublin linguist John Ibrahim Saeed said Armstrong's paper was [...] "even now the outstanding study of Somali phonetics", and in 1996, Martin Orwin wrote that it [...] "remains essential reading for anyone interested in pursuing any aspect of the sound system of Somali".|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{summarised}} in Internet Bookwatch as [...] "ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative". It {{was described as}} [...] "thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists." [...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would be an understatement to say that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> {{a few of the}} animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with,</b> he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

Kristof welcomed Sexants in the New York Times as [...] "sensibly {{organized}} and engagingly told" [...] but [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> {{much of the}} thesis of this book, {{but that is not}} to say that I disliked it. On the contrary, I probably liked it more for <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> it. Partly because of the boldness of the argument, it is stimulating and refreshing..." ...|$|R

Connally suffered three broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered wrist and had a bullet lodged in his leg. He underwent four hours of surgery after the shooting and recovered from his wounds. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–64 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24 year old ex-Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally did not dispute this conclusion but did {{for the rest of}} his life question the single bullet theory. In 1966, he told the press, [...] "I am convinced beyond any doubt that I was not struck by the first bullet," [...] and added, [...] "but just because <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the Warren Commission on this one finding does not mean <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> their overall findings." ...|$|E

2500|$|While often {{described}} as a black conservative, he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, [...] "I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that 'libertarian' would suit me better than many others, although <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the libertarian movement {{on a number of}} things". He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.|$|E
2500|$|Press reports {{indicated}} that Vice President Cheney [...] "repeatedly pressed Bush to pardon Libby" [...] {{to no avail}} {{in the final days}} of the Bush administration.

5000|$|When England manager Glenn Hoddle {{took the}} Captain's armband from Adams {{and gave it}} to Alan Shearer it was a bitter pill for Adams to swallow.

The Court's analysis assumes that the only interests at stake in the case are those of the Amish parents on the one hand, and those of the State on the other.

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{noted that the}} {{singular}} title [...] "the new perspective" [...] gives an unjustified impression of unity. It is a field of study in which many scholars are actively pursuing research and continuously revising their own theories in light of new evidence, and who do not necessarily agree with each other on any given issue. It has been suggested by many that a plural title of [...] "new" [...] perspectives may therefore be more accurate. In 2003, N. T.

[...] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) effectively announced its opposition to Ellison's candidacy, issuing a press release saying that his statement [...] "raises serious concerns about whether Ellison faithfully could represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel." [...] CNN also reported on his past support for anti-Semitic and radical organizations and individuals, particularly the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, but noted they found no anti-Semitic writings or public statements by Ellison, and cited his public rejection of the group [...] "due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements". The New York Times reported that one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, Haim Saban, said in his 2016 foreign policy forum that Ellison is [...] "clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” Reporters from the Washington Post, Slate and the Huffington Post have described this as part of a smear campaign against Ellison, and note that Ellison's rivals agreed that Saban should apologize for the comments. Schumer replied to critics, saying that Ellison has supported pro-Israeli policies within the Democratic Party, telling The Atlantic that [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> some of [...] past positions, I saw him orchestrate one of the most pro-Israel platforms in decades by successfully persuading other skeptical committee members to adopt such a strong platform." ...|$|E
