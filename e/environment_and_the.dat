Most of that time was spent as an assistant coach, and he served in that capacity at Maryland from 1952 to 1957, Oklahoma from 1957 to 1958, Iowa State from 1958 to 1965, and Army in 1966. At the United States Military Academy, Ward enjoyed the strictly regimented <b>environment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> players appreciated his aggressiveness.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic <b>environment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their <b>environment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided {{a new perspective on}} the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E

The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón have been reconstructed from scratch and {{are not part of the}} World Heritage Site.

UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and banisters. Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional architectural ensemble that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At the time of the nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the Pro Santa Cruz committee, Cordecruz, Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz, and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the <b>Environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing <b>environment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E

5|$|A compact cyclone, Fred quickly {{reached its}} peak {{strength}} as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg) and 85mph (140km/h) winds. Through the rest of August31, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of São Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Antão over the next 12hours. On September1, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September14, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.|$|E
