500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and <b>ghost</b> <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under [...] long at birth. The length at sexual maturity has not been precisely determined but is thought to be around [...] for males and [...] for females.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ghost</b> <b>catshark</b> is a {{demersal}} (bottom-loving) species living {{just above}} the seabed in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean between 40° and 60° North. It is present on the continental slopes off Massachusetts in the United States and on the Porcupine Bank west of Ireland. A reported sighting of the deep-water catshark (Apristurus profundorum) off Mauritania may have in fact been this species. It is also reported from deep water {{in the vicinity of}} Cape Town in South Africa.|$|E
