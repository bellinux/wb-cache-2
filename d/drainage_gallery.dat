40|$|One of the {{key factors}} in {{ensuring}} safe slopes in open pit mines is {{the control of the}} groundwater flow within the slope. When analyzing the flow regime and its characteristics, traditional numerical methods designed for soil-like materials may not always apply. In the present thesis, the two-dimensional finite element code FlowD was developed to analyze steady-state seepage through fractured rock masses, under saturated conditions. The program provides the user with two modelling options: porous (soil) materials, or fractured rock masses. The double-porosity model was incorporated in the code, in order to better model flow through anisotropic, heterogeneous fractured rock masses, where Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can apply. FlowD program calculates total pressure head, flow gradients and velocities within the specified domain. Drains, <b>drainage</b> <b>galleries</b> and wells, as well as aquifer recharge can be simulated. A real large-scale case study, with complex geological features has been simulated in order to demonstrate the application of the double porosity model.

The RCC dam, Miel I, is located in Colombia with 188 m high, and the dam is used for power production. The RCC mix has a cement content of 85 to 160 kg/m 3. To meet contractual schedule, the original design of an upstream face made of slip formed reinforced concrete was changed to a Carpi drained exposed PVC geocomposite system, placed on a 0. 4 m thick zone of RCC material enriched with cement grout and vibrated. Placement of the geocomposite system in horizontal stages allowed starting dam impoundment while RCC placement was still ongoing at higher elevation. The geocomposite system was completed in 2002, before complementary concrete works were finished. ISAGEN, {{the owner of the}} dam, constantly monitors the dam and the geocomposite system. The measured leakage has never surpassed the historical values, or overcome the maximum allowed drainage design values. After 11 years of good performance, in 2013 ISAGEN decided to have a comprehensive monitoring of the general conditions and weathering behaviour of the geocomposite system. Objectives of the investigation were to assess the reason of small cuts that had been detected and repaired (in total 15 in 11 years on a 31, 000 square meters surface), to assess the conditions of the PVC geocomposite, ascertaining at which extent its characteristics had changed over service, and to evaluate if the weathering behaviour was in accordance with the expected durability. Inspection at the upstream face and in the <b>drainage</b> <b>galleries</b> was followed by sampling and testing of the exposed geocomposites in the laboratory, to compare the physical and chemical properties of the aged geocomposite sample collected at the dam with those of the same geocomposite as manufactured. Evaluation of test results, based also on most recent research on geomembrane weathering mechanisms, completed the investigation. Results confirmed that the behaviour of the PVC geocomposite is extremely good and fully in line with expectations. The performance of the dam in 2015, after 13 years of service, keeps being extremely satisfactory.

In this context, C- and L-band SAR images covering the Nasca region since 2001 were identified for the purposes of this research and, in particular, the following data stacks were selected: ERS- 2 ascending data acquired in 2001 - 2011, ENVISAT ASAR ascending and descending data acquired in 2003 - 2007, and ALOS PALSAR descending and ascending data acquired in 2007 and 2008.

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of the Plavinas dam, Latvia was {{the subject}} of this final thesis. The objective was to investigate the weaknesses of the Plavinas dam and to present possible stabilising treatments. This includes a rough estimate on costs and construction methods. Plavinas hydroelectric power station is the most important dam in Latvia, supplying 30 % of the countrys power. The Plavinas blocks the runoff of the Daugava River, resulting in the formation of a reservoir. The power plant is a composite type structure consisting of a concrete power house and a spillway, which is located on top of the power house. The water from the reservoir can either flow through ten generating units located in the concrete power house, which is approximately 200 m long, or flow over the power house, the spillway. The head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace measures 40 m. Several kilometres of hydraulically filled embankment dams extend to both sides of the concrete power house. The dam is founded on glacial till overlying a sandstone layer. Drainage wells were incorporated in the foundation of the power house. This drainage system reduces the large uplift water pressures from the head difference between the reservoir level and the tailrace. This results in a larger effective weight of the structure, which is favourable for the bearing capacity of the structure against sliding and toppling. There are indications that the drainage wells, which can not be replaced under the concrete structure, do not function according to specifications: an increase of uplift water pressures is monitored. This could endanger the stability of the power house. transport of fine soil particles with the groundwater flow in the regional aquifer is occurring towards the <b>drainage</b> <b>galleries</b> near the right embankment as well as the drainage system underneath the structure. settlements of the power house have been observed, which seems to be caused by collapsing seepage channels. The power house structure and the aprons were schematised and the normative loading cases were determined. The stability of the structure was calculated for the following situations: original design assumptions in which the uplift water pressure is reduced by approximately 90 % rising water pressures due to continuously less effective original drainage system complete failure of drainage wells without compensating treatments different treatments, increasing the stability of the power house in case the original drainage fails entirely, either by adding more weight to compensate for the larger uplift water pressure or by reducing the uplift pressure by an extension of the seepage path or new drains. The different stabilising treatments were analysed in a multi criteria analysis taking into account amongst others the problem elimination, durability and feasibility of execution. The alternative of new drains in the downstream apron close to the power house provided the best alternative. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
