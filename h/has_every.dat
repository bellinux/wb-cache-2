Simpsons World <b>has</b> <b>every</b> episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes {{and the length of}} commercial breaks on the streaming service, but there are now fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that Simpsons World would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format.|$|E

25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for paraconsistent logic is {{the conviction that}} {{it ought to be}} possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, there is only one inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that <b>has</b> <b>every</b> sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.|$|E
25|$|Which means: if P and its {{negation}} ¬P {{are both}} {{assumed to be}} true, then P {{is assumed to be}} true, from which it follows {{that at least one of}} the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A is true, and also that P is not true (that ¬P is true) we can conclude that A, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial—that is, it <b>has</b> <b>every</b> sentence as a theorem.|$|E

He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state of Oklahoma) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes mightily to the city's devotion.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{customer}} purchasing an item which costs five pence, who possesses several silver sixpence coins. Some of these coins are more debased, {{while others are}} less so – but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and <b>has</b> <b>every</b> reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend {{to be of the}} most debased sort available to the parties.|$|E

Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the local computer without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created client software for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E

25|$|The DirectX {{software}} development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as <b>has</b> <b>every</b> version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided {{for most of the}} SDK samples. Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK.|$|E
25|$|The IOC has 4 major {{approaches}} to addressing environmental health concerns during {{the construction and}} competitions of the Olympic Games. First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games. Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and environmental impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare “pledges” to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC <b>has</b> <b>every</b> host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives. Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches {{in an attempt to}} minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.|$|E
500|$|In a 1990 paper, [...] "Elephants Don't Play Chess," [...] {{robotics}} researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at {{the physical}} symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since [...] "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always <b>has</b> <b>every</b> detail {{there is to be}} known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough." [...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E

500|$|Besides his further general remarks, Hazlitt lingers appreciatively over {{a number}} of amusing scenes and poetic passages, {{including}} the songs, all showing how [...] "Shakespear's comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast. Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity <b>has</b> <b>every</b> encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house is big enough to hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E
500|$|In the Netherlands, Han van Meegeren {{had become}} a {{well-known}} painter. Hertje (1921) and Straatzangers (1928) were particularly popular. His first legitimate copies were painted in 1923 – his Laughing Cavalier and Happy Smoker – both {{in the style of}} Frans Hals. By 1928, the similarity of van Meegeren’s paintings to those of the old masters began to draw the reproach of Dutch art critics, who were more interested in Cubist, Surrealist, and other movements. [...] It was said that van Meegeren’s gift was in imitation and that his talent was limited, outside of copying other artists' work. One critic wrote that he was [...] "a gifted technician who has made a sort of composite facsimile of the Renaissance school, he <b>has</b> <b>every</b> virtue except originality." [...] In response to these comments, van Meegeren published a series of aggressive articles in the monthly magazine De Kemphaan ("The Game Cock"). He raged against the art community together with journalist Jan Ubink between April 1928 and March 1930, and lost any sympathy with the critics in the process.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and <b>has</b> <b>every</b> year in between".|$|E
