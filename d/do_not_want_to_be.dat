We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> citizens. Well then! If they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E
25|$|Bullying {{behaviours}} in {{the workplace}} also exist among colleagues. They can be either the ‘target’ or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will take sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators always win, because witnesses <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the next target. This does encourage perpetrators to continue this behaviour. In addition, {{the sense of the}} injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they.|$|E
25|$|While {{some say}} that blanket consent, or the general consent to {{unspecified}} treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about {{the name of the}} drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options. Even though some patients <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> informed, health professionals are ethically bound to give proper information about the treatment given. There is such a debate over the use of placebos because while placebos are used for the good of many to test the effectiveness of drugs, some argue that it is unethical to ever deprive individual patients of effective drugs.|$|E

25|$|George Spelvin, Georgette Spelvin, and Georgina Spelvin are {{traditional}} pseudonyms used in programs in American theater. The {{reasons for the}} use of an alternate name vary. Actors who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> credited, or whose names would otherwise appear twice because they are playing more than one role in a production, may adopt a pseudonym. Actors who are members of the AFL-CIO trade union of professional actors known as Actors' Equity Association, but are working under a non-union contract and wish to avoid the significant penalties ranging from substantial fines to revocation of union membership that could result from working under non-union contracts, also use pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|When Sol persuades {{almost all}} of ShadowClan to give up belief in StarClan, Tawnypelt takes her kits Flamepaw, Tigerpaw, and Dawnpaw to ThunderClan, hoping to find refuge there, stating {{that she and her}} kits <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a Clan that does not believe in StarClan. In hope of helping ShadowClan, Raggedstar and Runningnose beg Jaypaw to help. Jaypaw, along with Tigerpaw, Flamepaw, Dawnpaw, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze, creates a fake sign from StarClan to show Blackstar StarClan is real. Blackstar is still not {{convinced}} until the fake sign turns real when Raggedstar and Runningnose come to tell Blackstar to get rid of Sol and to still believe in StarClan.

25|$|City councilors can run {{as either}} a {{representative}} of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives {{the greatest number of}} votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.|$|E

25|$|Rivers {{spends his}} last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his {{colleague}} in his new position. Dr. Yealland uses electro-shock therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cured and that pain is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients. Rivers questions whether he can work {{with a man who}} uses such techniques. Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job. The novel ends with Rivers completing his notes, meditating on the effect that the encounter with Sassoon, and the last few months, have had on him.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put {{in a position where they}} would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
500|$|Some autistic {{people have}} {{advocated}} {{a shift in}} perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex syndromes rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject {{the notion that there}} is an [...] "ideal" [...] brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is pathological; they promote tolerance for what they call neurodiversity. These views are the basis for the autistic rights and autistic pride movements. There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.|$|E

500|$|At {{the close}} of Grant's two terms as {{president}} in 1877, the Republican-controlled Congress suggested that Grant {{not return to the}} White House for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here [...] another four years. I do not think I could stand it." [...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E

Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to [...] "Harvard Girl," [...] and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.|$|E

500|$|... 4chan {{is one of}} the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, {{according}} to the Los Angeles Times. 4chan's Alexa rank is generally around 700, though it has been as high as number 56 at times. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet. However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money. The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.|$|E

500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, but we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aggressors." ...|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a problem for the}} club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we all know what happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E
500|$|The Nicaragua route {{had many}} {{supporters}} and a bill sponsored by Iowa Congressman William Peters Hepburn, which would authorize {{the construction of}} a canal on the Nicaragua route, had passed the House of Representatives. [...] In June 1902, it was considered by the Senate, and on June 5 and 6, Hanna made a speech against the Hepburn Bill. [...] In his speech, he referred to enormous maps, which were displayed in the Senate Chamber as he spoke. [...] This was a novel technique, especially as he referred to the possibility of active volcanoes on the Nicaragua route in his speech, and the maps showed [...] active volcanoes marked with red dots and extinct ones with black. [...] There was an almost continuous band of black dots through Nicaragua, with eight red ones; no dots were placed on the map of Panama. [...] Hanna pointed out many advantages of the Panama route: [...] it was shorter than the Nicaraguan route, would require much less digging, and had existing harbors at either end. [...] Hanna was in poor health as he gave the speech; Alabama Senator John Tyler Morgan, the Senate sponsor of the Hepburn Bill, tried to ask Hanna a question, only to be met with, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interrupted, for I am very tired." [...] At the end, Hanna warned that if the US built the Nicaragua canal, another power would finish the Panama route. [...] One senator stated that he had been converted to the [...] "Hannama Canal". [...] The bill was amended to support a Panama route, according to some accounts in part because Cromwell remembered that Nicaragua depicted volcanos on its postage stamps, and combed the stock of Washington stamp dealers until he found enough to send to the entire Senate. [...] The House afterwards agreed to the Senate amendment, and the bill authorizing a Panama canal passed.|$|E
