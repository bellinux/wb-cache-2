25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric,</b> is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

2500|$|The {{topology}} of a <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> {{is relatively}} complex. [...] Unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn {{that has been}} knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.|$|E
2500|$|Knitting creates {{multiple}} {{loops of}} yarn, called stitches, {{in a line}} or tube. Knitting has multiple active stitches on the needle at one time. <b>Knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> consists {{of a number of}} consecutive rows of intermeshing of [...] loops. [...] As each row progresses, a newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row, placed on the gaining needle, and the loops from the prior row are then pulled off the other needle.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{point-like}} ornaments may {{be added}} to knitting for their look or to improve the wear of the fabric. [...] Examples include various types of bobbles, sequins and beads.

30|$|Properties of weft <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were {{determined}} by yarn properties, fabric structure and any mechanical and chemical process which were performed about fabric and yarn.

2500|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. [...] In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. [...] In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. [...] By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. [...] Since a typical piece of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|E
2500|$|Fabrics {{in which}} each knitted row is {{followed}} by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward, giving the fabric more stretchability. Thus, the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward. [...] Conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches. [...] This is the basis of shadow knitting, in which the appearance of a <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> changes when viewed from different directions.|$|E
2500|$|The basic <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> (as in the diagram, {{and usually}} called a {{stocking}} or stockinette pattern) has a definite [...] "right side" [...] and [...] "wrong side". [...] On the right side, the visible {{portions of the}} loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of V shapes. [...] On the wrong side, {{the ends of the}} loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called reverse stockinette. (Despite being the [...] "wrong side," [...] reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.) [...] Because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.|$|E
30|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to predict the physical, {{mechanical}} and comfort properties of woven, non-woven and <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> using various prediction tools. Most of the work is focused on modelling the fibre-yarn relationship, yarn tenacity, fault detection, compression, elastic properties and hand values of woven, nonwoven and <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Although some studies have discussed prediction of thermal properties i.e. thermal resistance, thermal conductivity of woven and <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics,</b> none of the studies give a detailed review of the modelling of comfort properties particularly thermal absorptivity and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Moreover, very few studies are devoted to the prediction of thermo-physiological properties: thermal properties, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate collectively. An attempt is therefore made to model the thermo-physiological properties of plated <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> from constructional parameters like back yarn linear density, filament fineness, loop length and total yarn linear density using statistical and artificial neural network approach and comparison of the developed models in terms of their prediction performance and robustness.|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} {{properties of the}} majority of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> are good stretchability and elasticity, and thus the resulting freedom of movement. They are able to adopt themselves to the body shape of the wearer and have good air permeability, offering high standard of wear comfort. In this paper, the influence of structural properties and characteristics of fiber on the thermal properties, air and water vapor permeability, as well on the physical-mechanical properties of single jersey <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were investigated. Single jersey <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> are made of 100 % wool, 50 / 50 % acryl/cotton, and 100 % acryl yarn. The thermal properties of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were measured by method of D-r Boc. Correlation and regression analysis were used for data processing. The results indicate that characteristics of the fibres have significant influence on the the physical-mechanical and thermal properties, while structural characteristics have significant influence on the air and water vapor permeability. <b>Knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> made of 100 %wool have the highest thermal resistance and warmer feeling and touch due to the lower thermal absortivity value, while <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> of 50 / 50 % acryl/cotton gave a séance of coolness.

2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric,</b> a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E
2500|$|Ordinarily, {{stitches}} are knitted in {{the same}} order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric. [...] However, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern. [...] Cables patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic; Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling. [...] Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric. [...] Knitters have developed methods for giving the illusion of a circular wale, such as appear in Celtic knots, but these are inexact approximations. [...] However, such circular wales are possible using Swiss darning, a form of embroidery, or by knitting a tube separately and attaching it to the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{perception}} that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less [...] "give" [...] than <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric,</b> and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items. Though this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, {{it is not necessarily}} true for crochet in general. Most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn. Tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces. According to sources claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch. Any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric. Cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.|$|E
