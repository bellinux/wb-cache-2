40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} three {{arguments}} {{in relation to}} the regulation of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in national foreign <b>investment</b> <b>laws.</b> First, there is a broad convergence in national foreign <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> on how to regulate Chinese SOEs when they make cross-border investments. Second, the nature and function of SOEs in China’s socialist market economy is still poorly understood. Consequently, the broad convergence in SOE regulation in national foreign <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> remains too crude a legal criterion in practice. Third, the complexity of Chinese SOEs in Chinese political and economic context calls for a more nuanced approach to regulate SOEs in national foreign <b>investment</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R

The first regulatory reform in Laos aimed at shifting the country’s foreign economic relations was {{the enactment of the}} foreign <b>investment</b> <b>laws.</b> The laws and regulations have been revised recently to create a more favourable investment climate. The Lao government has provided a wide range of tax and non-tax incentives for investment projects within the Special Economic Zones (SEZs), reduction on import taxes and tax on foreign corporate profit that is lower than for domestic enterprises.   Foreign direct <b>investment</b> (FDI) <b>laws</b> are relatively liberal, allowing 100 per cent foreign ownership across a wide range of sectors...|$|R

The key objectives of the law were the creation of the CNPE and the ANP, increased use of natural gas, increased competition in the energy market, and investments in power generation. The state monopoly of oil and gas exploration was ended, and energy subsidies were reduced.

40|$|Nowaday's {{investment}} activities have been increasing in an alarming speed. This {{is due to}} the undeniable fact of globalization which consecutively created highly favorable condition for MNCs to go to different corner of world to establish their plant, and invest on different sectors of economy. Some times while doing investment MNCs have been polluting air and failed to work in socially responsible manner. Due to this fact, there have been different move by the world society to protect environment. Despite these move, there still have gaps that should be filled immediately by cooperation of world community, especially by developed countries. Currently, in Ethiopia too, there are huge inflows of FDI and domestic investments due to the strong measure the current government has been taking to promote investment by adopting <b>investment</b> friendly <b>laws.</b> Besides, the government of Ethiopia has been enacting environmental protection laws. Hence, in Ethiopia, there are large amount of <b>investment</b> promoting <b>laws</b> and environmental protection laws. On one hand, the government has been turning every stone to achieve the goals of economic development, and on another hand it seems that there are moves toward protecting environment. However, balancing these two important agendas (development and environmental protection) highly requires commitment. This paper going to assess how much place and attention is being given for environmental protection by <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> of the country, and the obligations that are set in environmental <b>laws</b> to <b>investment</b> activities. Furthermore, incompatibilities between selected <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> and environmental laws will be analyzed.

25|$|Realizing {{the dearth}} of {{domestic}} capital capable of re-juvenating growth, Suharto reversed Sukarno's economic autarky policies by opening selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} much-needed foreign investment under the new Foreign <b>Investment</b> <b>Law</b> of January 1967 (containing generous tax holidays and free movement of money). Suharto himself travelled to Western Europe and Japan in a series of trips to promote investment into Indonesia, starting in the natural resources sector. Among the first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia were mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company and International Nickel Company, later followed by significant investment from Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. From 1967, the government managed to secure low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of changes in state prudent trust <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> on asset {{allocation}} in noncommercial trusts. The old prudent man rule favored “safe” investments such as government bonds and disfavored “speculation” in stock. The new prudent investor rule, now widely adopted, relies on modern portfolio theory, freeing the trustee to invest based on risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust and {{in light of the}} composition of the trust portfolio as a whole. Using state- and institution-level panel data from 1986 - 1997, we find that after a state’s adoption of the new prudent investor rule, trust institutions held about 1. 5 to 4. 5 percentage points more stock at the expense of “safe” investments. Accordingly, we conclude that trustees are sensitive to changes in trust fiduciary law. Even though trust <b>investment</b> <b>laws</b> are nominally default rules, such rules matter in the presence of agency costs and unreliable judicial enforcement of opt outs...|$|R
