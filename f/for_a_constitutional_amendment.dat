5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E

5|$|The casino {{legislation}} was not called {{to a vote}} in the Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 would have been required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E

25|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was re-elected in 2011. As the Constitution of Argentina {{does not}} allow more than two {{consecutive}} terms, several politicians from the Front for Victory (FPV) speculated about {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow unlimited re-elections. This idea was heavily resisted by the opposition parties, and the FPV could not reach the required two-thirds majority in Congress. The mid-term elections in 2013 ended the FPV's hope <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> after they failed to win the necessary supermajority.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September, {{thousands}} of South Africans {{took to the}} streets in several cities to protest same-sex marriage. The minor opposition African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) pushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to define marriage as {{between a man and a}} woman; this was rejected by the National Assembly's portfolio committee on Home Affairs. Public hearings on the Civil Union Bill began on 20 September.

25|$|Euro {{adoption}} {{will require}} the approval {{of at least two}} thirds of the Sejm to make a constitutional amendment changing the official currency from the złoty to the euro. The ruling Law and Justice Party opposes euro adoption. Former PM Donald Tusk has said that he may agree to a referendum on euro participation in order to gain their support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> Public opinion is against participation according to polls, with more than 70 percent believing that adoption of the euro would be bad for the Polish economy according to one poll from September 2012.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2009, {{following}} {{comments by}} China proposing {{adoption of a}} global reserve currency, Bachmann introduced a resolution calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to bar the dollar from being replaced by a foreign currency. Current law prohibits foreign currency from being recognized in the U.S., but Bachmann expressed concerns relating to the President's power to make and interpret treaties. Earlier that month, at a Financial Services Committee hearing, Bachmann asked both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke if they would reject calls for the U.S. {{to move away from}} the U.S. dollar and they replied that they would reject such a call.|$|E
25|$|Palin opposed state-covered {{health and}} retiree {{benefits}} to same-sex partners of state employees but complied with an Alaska Supreme Court directive {{to do so}} and subsequently vetoed {{a bill that would have}} denied the benefits. In an interview with Newsweek in 2007, she affirmed her support for an amendment to the state constitution denying benefits to same-sex couples. She later signed a bill ordering a non-binding referendum <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to deny the benefits. Although the referendum passed in April 2007, with 53 percent of voters supporting a constitutional amendment, a bill to place such an amendment on the ballot in November 2008 stalled in the state legislature.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, after New York legalized {{same-sex}} marriage, Perry {{stated that}} it was their {{right to do so}} under the principle of states' rights in the Tenth Amendment.

50|$|The court's {{ruling was}} {{subsequently}} upheld, and in October 2015 the monument was quietly removed from Capitol grounds {{to a private}} property several blocks away.

The Legislature passed the resolution placing the question on the Oklahoma ballot, with voters to decide at the November 2016 election. The resolution was subsequently defeated.|$|R
25|$|The Congress or Kongreso has two chambers.

These party list seats are only accessible to marginalized and under-represented groups and parties, local parties, and sectoral wings of major parties that represent the marginalized. The Constitution of the Philippines allows the House of Representatives {{to have more than}} 250 members by statute without a need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> The Senate or Senado has 24 members which are elected on a nationwide at-large basis; they do not represent any geographical district.

25|$|The Federalist {{states in}} the House of Representatives decided to give their votes to Aaron Burr for President when he and Jefferson tied in the Presidential {{election}} of 1800. Their aim was to prevent at any cost the influential and rich in new visions Jefferson from becoming President. With help from Alexander Hamilton, the gridlock was finally broken on the thirty-sixth vote and Jefferson was elected President on February 17, 1801. The events in the House, combined with the increasing Democratic-Republican majorities in the House and Senate, prompted the Democratic-Republicans to call <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> requiring separate votes for President and Vice President in the Electoral College. By doing this, the Democratic-Republicans could dash the Federalists' hopes of having any impact on the Presidential election of 1804.|$|E

50|$|During {{this same}} period, Oklahoma's Governors, legislature, and {{delegation}} to Congress {{continued to be}} dominated by the Democratic Party. However, there was political infighting over deficit spending in the late 1930s, leading to a successful bipartisan push <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 1941 <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> requiring legislators to pass a balanced budget.
