40|$|Economic {{benefits}} of management {{reform in the}} <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico <b>grouper</b> fishery: A semi-parametric analysis Quinn Weninger∗ Revised: December, 2007 This paper uses a semi-parametric empirical model to estimate the economic {{benefits of}} adopting a property rights-based management program in the <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico <b>grouper</b> fishery. The analysis predicts that a rights-based fleet will be comprised of fewer, more cost efficient boats than under the current controlled access management program. Results indicate that {{in the year of}} our data, 1993, the smaller, more productive fleet could harvest the allowable reef fish catch at a cost saving of $ 2. 92 -$ 7. 07 million, 12 - 30 % less than under controlled access management. Recent tightening of controlled access regulations suggest that the benefits from management reform could be even larger in the current day fishery...|$|R

40|$|Shifting {{environmental}} baselines are inter-generational {{changes in}} {{perception of the}} state of the environment. As one generation replaces another, people's perceptions of what is natural change even to the extent that they no longer believe historical anecdotes of past abundance or size of species. Although widely accepted, this phenomenon has yet to be quantitatively tested. Here we survey three generations of fishers from Mexico's Gulf of California (N= 108), where fish populations have declined steeply over the last 60 years, to investigate how far and fast their environmental baselines are shifting. Compared to young fishers, old fishers named five times as many species and four times as many fishing sites as once being abundant/productive but now depleted (Kruskal–Wallis tests, both p< 0. 001) with no evidence of a slowdown in rates of loss experienced by younger compared to older generations (Kruskal–Wallis test, n. s. in both cases). Old fishers caught up to 25 times as many <b>Gulf</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca jordani as young fishers on their best ever fishing day (regression r 2 = 0. 62, p< 0. 001). Despite times of plentiful large fish still being within living memory, few young fishers appreciated that large species had ever been common or nearshore sites productive. Such rapid shifts in perception of what is natural help explain why society is tolerant of the creeping loss of biodiversity. They imply a large educational hurdle in efforts to reset expectations and targets for conservation...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperTheory {{suggests}} that fishing effort would be allocated among various fishing grounds such that profit levels would be equal. Homogeneity among fishers {{as well as}} perfect information is assumed and profits are opportunistically increased by changing fishing locations. These assumptions have been shown empirically ins some single fisheries where fishers and areas are relatively homogeneous. However, complexity arises when dealing with multispecies and multi-ground fisheries. Biological, economic, and regulatory measures further add to the complexity and complicate determining response by fishers to various factors. This study provides a spatial analysis of the U. S. <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico <b>grouper</b> fishery and lays some grounds {{for future studies on}} fleet dynamics, location choice, and potential impacts to commercial <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico <b>grouper</b> fishermen behavior under varying economic and regulatory conditions. The study is timely in that red grouper, one of the primary species targeted by commercial fishermen, has recently been declared as overfished and alternative regulations are currently be evaluated to rebuild the stock...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of marine resources is often impeded {{by a lack}} of models to integrate ecological and economic information on exploited populations. We used available biological and economic data for an overexploited population of the leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea) to study if closing parts of the population to fishing would allow sustainable use and maximum economic benefits. Our results suggest that fishing should be closed in all spawning areas and in at least 50 % of the adjacent areas. High non-consumptive benefits would be achieved with large closures because the abundance of the leopard groupers, which is an important attribute for SCUBA divers, would increase. In a no-take reserve, the welfare gains of divers seemingly could compensate for losses incurred by fishers if parts of their fishing grounds are closed. An adaptive management scheme could provide a way to incorporate newly available information into management decisions for the no-take reserve.

40|$|The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council {{determined}} that previous {{management of the}} grouper and tilefish fisheries in the northern Gulf of Mexico were not meeting management goals, and developed a catch shares program using individual fishing quotas (IFQs) beginning in January 2010 in order to more effectively manage these fisheries. An IFQ is a management method in which individual fishers and corporations are allocated the right to harvest a percentage of a fishery's total allowable catch, thus specifying {{how much of a}} particular species each fisher can harvest. This study makes use of a mail out survey to document the perceptions of fishers, seafood wholesalers, fisheries managers, and academics with an interest in the (northern) <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico <b>grouper</b> and tilefish IFQ program. While fishers, seafood dealers, fisheries managers, and academics all acknowledge that the IFQ program will create some problems, commercial fishers and dealers were far more skeptical of the alleged benefits of IFQs. Moreover, larger commercial operators were more inclined to agree with managers and academics that the IFQ program will produce several benefits for their operations and the fisheries. Some smaller operators believe that they will be driven to ignore the new rules or be forced out of business. In the future, the Gulf Council might do two things: put a bit more effort into making fishers aware of the potential benefits of IFQs, and develop alternatives with more flexibility perhaps working more closely with communities of fishers, who prize their independent way of life above all else.
