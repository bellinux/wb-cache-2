40|$|To {{investigate}} anaerobic secondary <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing</b> by microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) under {{low light}} intensity (14 μmol/m 2 /s), bubbling column reactors were operated in batches of 8 d with initial ammonium nitrogen 10 - 50 mg/L, initial phosphate phosphorus 2 - 10 mg/L and microalgal seed 40 mg/L. Maximum microalgal biomass and minimum generation time were 370. 9 mg/L and 2. 5 d, respectively. Nitrogen removal (maximum 99. 6 %) was mainly attributed to microalgal growth rate, while phosphorus removal (maximum 49. 8 %) {{was related to}} microalgal growth rate, cell phosphorus content (maximum 1. 5 %) and initial nutrients ratio. Dissolved microalgal organics release in terms of chemical oxygen demand (maximum 63. 2 mg/L) and hexane extractable material (i. e., oil and grease, maximum 8. 5 mg/L) was firstly reported and mainly affected by nitrogen deficiency and deteriorated effluent quality.

40|$|Although {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) {{have been}} developed as a key treatment technology for wastewater reuse and recycling during the past 20 years, application of this technology is still limited due to high membrane costs as well as high energy consumption. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a low-cost MBR by using used non-woven modularized membranes. A bench-scale MBR system was developed with the membrane module. It was found that a dual-media structured module can achieve excellent permeate quality (turbidity < 1. 5 NTU and SS < 3 mg/L) with a permeate flux of 1. 5 m 3 /m 2 day, under a daily backwash condition. The maximal operation MLSS level was identified as not greater than 5, 000 mg/L under the above operation conditions. When the F/M ratio was 0. 18 g COD/g MLSS/day and the sludge age was 45 days, the system can remove 90 % COD and 88 % ammonia. The permeate of the non-woven MBR technology developed in this study satisfies the wastewater reuse requirement for urban uses. In addition to the MBR application, the developed non-woven membrane module is also applicable in secondary <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing.</b> This study showed that the effluent SS and turbidity of an activated sludge process can be reduced from 25 to 2. 3 mg/L and 10 to 2. 1 NTU, respectively, when the MLSS in the aeration tank was 3, 000 mg/L. In this application, no aeration for membrane fouling prevention was provided and the backwash frequency was reduced from daily to a monthly basis. These enabled effluent reuse with the developed low-cost membrane to become much more cost-effective compared to conventional <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing</b> technologies.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of gamma irradiation on the disinfection of the water and wastewater from Isfahan wastewater treatment plants. Materials and Methods : Using a 60 CO gamma radiation machine with emission rate of 405. 38 CGy/min, water and wastewater samples were irradiated at doses of 20 - 160 Gy and 80 - 240 Gy, respectively. Microbial cultures were performed on the samples to assess the pre- and post-irradiation coliforms content. Results : The results of microbial tests showed that approximately 100 % of the total and fecal coliforms in water samples were inactive at 160 Gy dose of gamma radiation. At a dose of 240 Gy, gamma-ray efficiency for inactivation of the total coliforms in the effluent was different, considering the sample quality. The efficiency for secondary <b>effluent,</b> <b>polished,</b> and filtered samples was 56, 83, and 64 %, respectively. In this case, reduction of fecal coliforms was 46, 58, and 81 %, respectively. The effective reduction of the coliforms in the effluent samples (80 - 50 %) was also observed at doses of 120 - 240 Gy. According to the dose-response curves, as the radiation dose increases, the inactivation of the coliforms increases linearly. Conclusion: At gamma doses used in this study, the coliforms were removed completely. But for wastewater samples, although the removal efficiencies were above 80 %, the environmental standards related to microbial parameters were not satisfied. Therefore, it is necessary to use higher doses of gamma radiation...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, estrogenic {{contaminants}} and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) received {{more and more}} attention due to their adverse effects as endocrine disruptors. There {{is a need to}} examine fate of these contaminants during wastewater treatment and <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing</b> process, as well as during the land application of biosolids as soil amendments, within the context of potable water reuse and sludge application, which have all been widely practiced. Two major research goals guided this research. The first goal was to develop experimental protocols measuring estrogenic activity (including nonylphenol) and PBDEs in environmental samples, especially in organic rich solid samples such as sludges, sediments and soils which are impacted by wastewater and/or application of biosolids. The second objective was to evaluate fate of estrogenic activity and PBDEs during conventional wastewater treatment, <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing,</b> and sludge handling processes including digestion, dewatering, composting, and land application of biosolids by using the protocols developed. The protocol developed to measure estrogenic activity or PBDEs in the solids includes extraction, cleanup, and determination steps. Each step is critical for the successful determination; however cleanup step was the most difficult. In this study, a C 18 resin was used as the media to remove the bulk organic interferences in the measurement of estrogenic activity and nonylphenol. In comparison, Florisil was used in the cleanup step for PBDE analysis. In the development of each protocol, mobile phase was carefully selected and optimum cleanup strategy was determined, recovery of analytes during cleanup operation was measured. During the development of method measuring the estrogenic activity, effects of extraction variables such as solvent, pressure, and time were investigated. The performance of each protocol was examined by spike and recovery experiments. Experiments indicated that estrogenic activity and nonylphenol were largely removed during traditional wastewater treatment, soil aquifer treatment, and surface transport along a wastewater dependent stream. Examination of estrogenic activity and nonylphenol in sludge, sediments in contact with wastewater and mass balance analysis of these estrogenic contaminants in traditional wastewater treatment plants and infiltration basins indicated that both adsorption and biodegradation play important roles. In comparison, estrogenic activity and nonylphenol were persistent during anaerobic sludge digestion. More experiments are warranted to understand fate of PBDEs during sludge digestion process, although limited data show possible degradation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSewage from {{scattered}} villages {{is often}} treated in septic tanks whose removal efficiency of biodegradable components amounts to about 35 %. Viewed {{from the standpoint}} of water protection such a performance provides an insufficient prevention of water pollution. It is worth aspiring to more extensive sewage treatment, i. e. oxidation of organic matter and nitrogen compounds. This particularly applies to rural regions if scattered villages are situated in ecologically sensitive regions such as watersheds of small brooks. Here, it is resonable to emply natural methods of treating sewage such as constructed wetlands and lagoons up to a size of 1, 000 population equivalents. Constructed wetlands and lagoons provide an excellent field of cooperation between biologist and engineer, because the complexity of the microbial communities and the influence of the physico-chemical and geological conditions upon the microorganisms are not yet well understood.

40|$|Seventy-three {{commonly}} administered pharmaceuticals from twelve different therapeutic {{classes were}} investigated at a municipal {{wastewater treatment plant}} in northern Italy featuring a conventional activated sludge system (full-scale) and a polishing horizontal subsurface flow bed (pilot plant). Removal of these micro-pollutants by the two systems was assessed in order to evaluate their respective contributions. Mean concentrations and standard deviations were calculated and found to differ for the compounds detected, ranging from few ng/L to over 1165 ng/L in the secondary effluent and from 11 to 533 in the <b>polished</b> <b>effluent.</b> Eighteen compounds were consistently below the detection limit and the remaining 55 compounds were found at a minimum of one sampling point. Average removal efficiencies of both treatment steps and in treatment train as a whole are evaluated and discussed, highlighting the difficulties in predicting the fate of pharmaceuticals in both an activated sludge system and a horizontal subsurface flow bed. Comparison between the observed average removal efficiencies and those reported in the literature was also carried out for the pharmaceuticals of interest, and the discrepancies that emerged are discussed. The investigated constructed wetland did show efficacy in removing some of these compounds, and it contributed to the overall removal efficiency of each therapeutic class. Indeed, evaluation of the specific mass loadings of each class of PhC detected in the raw wastewaters, secondary and <b>polished</b> <b>effluent</b> evidences that the investigated constructed wetland is able to further reduce the load of micropollutants, which could become a necessity, especially where the receiving water body is an effluent-dominant river and mitigation measures of the discharge impact are required to protect and safeguard the aquatic environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{chemicals}} used in modern printing processes are either toxic or difficult to decompose, {{which results in}} the production of complicated and refractory printing wastewater. In this study, an electrocatalytic technology with different catalytic electrodes was employed to treat a real printing wastewater, and the production rates of hydroxyl radicals were determined. The results indicate that under a voltage gradient of 11 Vcm− 1, the production concentration of hydroxyl radicals by various electrodes followed a decreasing order of TiO 2 >DSA (dimensional sustainable anode with IrO 2) >graphite, with the values of 8. 21 × 10 − 3, 5. 24 × 10 − 3, and 0. 86 × 10 − 3 M, respectively. A lower wastewater conductivity could lead to a greater electric voltage thus contributing to a higher removal efficiency of TOC and chroma. At a current density of 50 mAcm− 2 and using one pair of electrodes (IrO 2 +stainless steel), the TOC and chroma removal efficiencies reached 71 % and 53 % after 60 min treatment. Under the same operation conditions but using two pairs of electrodes, the removal efficiencies of TOC and chroma were increased to 75 % and 82 %, respectively. The removal efficiencies of TOC and chroma could be further raised to 90 % and 92 % if the electrocatalytic <b>effluent</b> was <b>polished</b> by powder activated carbon absorption...|$|R

40|$|Water {{reclamation}} and reuse {{is being}} actively promoted in Australia. In Queensland, surface-flow constructed wetlands with {{a diversity of}} macrophyte types offer the greatest potential for <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing.</b> Constructed wetlands in subtropical climates in coastal regions and arid climates in inland western regions are conducive to high macrophyte growth rates and nutrient removal, in particular nitrogen, producing an effluent suitable for irrigation, restoration of wetlands and/or release into natural waterways. Faecal-coliform removal is also high, producing effluent with < 1000 cfu/ 100 mL and as low as 100 cfu/ 100 mL, acceptable for agricultural irrigation. Constructed wetlands can be designed to maximise the removal of both nutrients and pathogens by enhancing macrophyte diversity and natural disinfection processes by incorporating lagoons, shallow-water wetlands and subsurface-flow wetlands into the treatment train. Surface-flow wetlands can also be designed to minimise mosquito breeding by increasing macro-invertebrate predators, thereby alleviating community concerns about potential health risks.

Anaerobic digestion (AD) however, still requires optimisation of conversion efficiency from biomass to methane. Augmenting methane energy production with simultaneous BioH 2 and bioelectrochemical stage(s) would increase process efficiencies while meeting post treatment effluent quality. Pre-treatment of feedstock increase bacterial accessibility to biomass, thus increasing the conversion yield to target product, but an alternative is separating the acidogenic/hydrolytic processes of AD from methanogenesis.

40|$|Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug, {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly detected pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. In this work, biologically produced manganese oxides (BioMnOx) were investigated to remove diclofenac. At neutral pH, the diclofenac oxidation with BioMnOx was 10 -fold faster than with chemically produced MnO 2. The main advantage of BioMnOx over chemical MnO 2 is the ability of the bacteria to reoxidize the formed Mn 2 +, which inhibits the oxidation of diclofenac. Diclofenac- 2, 5 -iminoquinone was identified as a major transformation product accounting for 5 - 10 % of the transformed diclofenac. Except for 5 -hydroxydiclofenac, which was identified as an intermediate, no other oxidation products were detected. Diclofenac oxidation was proportional to the amount of BioMnOx dosed, and the pseudo first order rate constant k was 6 -fold higher when pH was decreased from 6. 8 to 6. 2. The Mn 2 + levels remained below the drinking water limit (0. 05 mg L- 1), thus indicating the efficient in situ microbiological regeneration of the oxidant.

Average influent unfiltered chemical oxygen demand (CODT), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium–N (NH 4 +–N), ortho-phosphorus (PO 4 3 −–P), and SS concentrations of 1, 991  ±  296, 163  ±  40, 42.3  ±  16.9, 27.2  ±  6.9, and 84  ±  30  mg L− 1 were recorded. The single-layer SF decreased the influent concentration of CODT, TN, NH 4 +–N, PO 4 –P, and SS by 39, 36, 34, 58, and 52 %, respectively. Influent concentrations of CODT, TNT, NH 4 –N, PO 4 –P, and SS were decreased by 56, 57, 41, 74, and 62 % in the stratified SF. The single-layer SF and the stratified SF were capable of reducing the influent concentration of total coliforms by 96 and 95 %, respectively. Both types of SFs produced final water quality in excess of the standards for re-use in the washing of milking parlours.|$|R
40|$|The surging {{demand for}} plasma proteins, mainly {{driven by the}} growing market and the {{development}} of new therapeutic indications, is promoting manufacturers to improve the throughput of plasma proteins. Due to the inherent convective mass transfer, membrane chromatography has been proved to be an efficient approach for extracting a small amount of target proteins from large-volume feed. In this study, ai-antitrypsin (AAT) was extracted from human plasma fraction IV by a two-step membrane chromatography. An anion-exchange membrane chromatography (AEMC) was used to capture the plasma proteins in bind/elute mode, and the obtained <b>effluent</b> was further <b>polished</b> by a hydrophobic interaction membrane chromatography (HIMC) in flow-through mode. Under optimal conditions, the recovery and purity of MT achieved 87. 0 % and 0. 58 MT/protein (g/g) by AEMC, respectively. After the precise polishing by HIMC, the purity of AAT was 1. 22 MT/protein (g/g). The comparison results showed that membrane chromatography outperformed column chromatography in both steps because of its high throughput. This two-step membrane chromatography could obtain an MT recovery of 83. 3 % and an activity recovery of 91. 4 %. The outcome of this work not only offers an alternative process for protein purification from plasma, but also provides guidelines for manufacturing product from a large-volume feed with multi-components by membrane chromatography.

40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{conducted}} {{a demonstration of}} cometabolic technology for bioremediation of groundwater contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) and other chlorinated solvents. The technology demonstration was located at a seep from the K- 1070 -C/D Classified Burial Ground at the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site. The technology demonstration was designed to evaluate the performance of {{two different types of}} cometabolic processes. In both cases, the TCE is cometabolized in the sense that utilization of a different primary substrate is necessary to obtain the simultaneous cometabolism of TCE. Trichloroethylene alone is unable to support growth and maintenance of the microorganisms. Methanotrophic (methane-utilizing) technology was demonstrated first; aromatic-utilizing microorganisms were demonstrated later. The demonstration was based on scaleup of laboratory and bench-scale prototype equipment that was used to establish the technical feasibility of the processes. This report documents the operation of the methanotrophic bioreactor system to treat the seep water at the demonstration site. The initial objectives were to demonstrate stable operation of the bioreactors and associated equipment, including the pretreatment and <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing</b> steps; and evaluate the biodegradation of TCE and other organics in the seep water for the three operating modes [...] air oxidation pretreatment, steam-stripping pretreatment, and no pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMembrane {{filtration}} using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) {{or reverse}} osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient <b>effluent</b> <b>polishing</b> step at municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) {{for the removal of}} selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP 3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP 3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (> 60 %) removed BP 3, UV- 329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (< 20 %) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30 – 50 % of COD, 80 – 95 % of TP, up to 30 % of TN and NH 4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The pilot-scale {{experiment}} in {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) with {{a capacity of}} 433 L was carried out for this study with real life situations, it was decided that the complete research work must be done under as realistic conditions as possible, i. e. with real municipal wastewater, chemical free and with local commercially available products such as carriers for biofilm reactor. The reactor was start-up in 30 / 9 / 2013 up to date, Effluent from clarifier of STP used as influence of MBBR for polishing. MBBR is using continues down flow to <b>polish</b> <b>effluent</b> municipal wastewater from a faculty of new building engineering community in UKM to get the water free from main pollutant parameters, for reuse in the irrigation or discharge to the river. Laboratory experiments will conduct with different hydraulic retention time (HRT), filling ratio of plastic (Enviro Multi Media) in the MBBR about 5 %. Aerobic reactors used the majority of the decaying organic material. An average removal rate of 41. 75 %, 32. 85 %, 24. 80 % and 35. 77 % of initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) were achieved under a HRT of 24 hr, 12 hr, 6 hr and 2 hr, respectively. The model simulated results showed good agreements with experimental results.

40|$|<b>Effluent</b> {{treatment}} and <b>polishing</b> using moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs) are advanced technique in biological treatment operations become increasing widely and popular use {{all over the}} world to treat various types of effluents with very different operating status. It is a combination of two separate processes suspended and attached growth systems for the treatment in order to minimize the concentrations of the contaminated parameters at the required level for reuse or final destination. The MBBR has been proved to be effective in great removing biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) with nutrients (N and P) from the effluent stream simultaneously. It provides additional capacity of wastewater treatment technology with high treatment efficiency; low capital, operational, maintenance and replacement cost; single reliable and robust operation procedure. This process can be used for new sewage treatment works or for modifying (upgrading) existing wastewater treatment plants as it is efficient, compact and easy to operate. The efficiency of MBBR depends on the filling percent of biofilm carriers to be provided inside the tank, surface area of the biocarrier, diffused aeration supply and the organic loading. The aim of this paper is reviewing the sewage {{treatment and}} polishing using moving bed bioreactor MBB technology as an alternative and successful method. It presents the advantages of the MBBR compared to conventional waste water treatment. The review also includes many relevant researches carried out at the laboratory andpilot scales plants that could improve these systems by enhancing performance and reducing costs...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleWashing-down parlours and {{standing}} areas, following milking on dairy farms, produces dairy soiled water (DSW) that contains variable concentrations of nutrients. Aerobic woodchip filters can remove organic matter, nutrients and suspended solids (SS) in DSW, but the effluent exiting the filters {{may have to}} be further treated before it is suitable for re-use for washing yard areas. The performance of a single-layer sand filter (SF) and a stratified SF, loaded at a 20 L m- 2 d- 1, to <b>polish</b> <b>effluent</b> from a woodchip filter was investigated over 82 days. Average influent unfiltered chemical oxygen demand (CODT), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium-N (NH 4 -N), ortho-phosphorus (PO 4 -P) and SS concentrations of 1991 Â± 296, 163 Â± 40, 42. 3 Â± 16. 9, 27. 2 Â± 6. 9 and 84 Â± 30 mg L- 1 were recorded. The single-layer SF decreased the influent concentration of CODT, TN, NH 4 -N, PO 4 -P and SS by 39, 36, 34, 58 and 52 %, respectively. Influent concentrations of CODT, TNT, NH 4 -N, PO 4 -P and SS were decreased by 56, 57, 41, 74 and 62 % in the stratified SF. The single-layer SF and the stratified SF were capable of reducing the influent concentration of total coliforms by 96 and 95 %, respectively. Although a limited amount of biomass accumulated in the upper-most layers of both SFs, organic and particulate matter deposition within both filters affected rates of nitrification. Â  Both types of SFs produced final water quality in excess of the standards for re-use in the washing of milking parlours. Teagas...|$|R
