5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} welfare-based {{framework}} proposed by Katsoulacos and Ulph (2009) to examine {{a number of questions}} related to enforcement structures for competition policy. Does the presence of <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews,</b> offering an independent judgement on Competition Authority decisions and checking procedural correctness, make effects-based decision approaches more attractive than Per Se? Under what conditions will <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> and internal error correction mechanisms improve welfare? What are the implications of internal error correction mechanisms for decision procedures? In the presence of such mechanisms should decisions be reached unanimously or through a majority rule? We demonstrate that <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> do not in general make effects-based decision approaches more attractive than Per Se. However, by reducing false-convictions costs and increasing false-acquittals costs of effects-based procedures they tend to make these more attractive than Per Se when the former effect outweighs the latter. Further, <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> and internal error-correction mechanisms subject to unanimity reduce deterrence. Mor...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> {{available}} under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> is {{an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a total ouster or {{finality}} clause {{which seeks}} to preclude <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> entirely, a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith, {{in which case the}} decision impugned may be subject to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed.|$|E

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he {{meant that the}} common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> {{has been}} {{attempted}} by the Parliament of Singapore {{to protect the}} exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> as the Court did not explain this.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{subsequently}} {{passed the}} Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Section8B(1) of the amended ISA provides {{that the law}} pertaining to the <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided. In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990), the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in Singapore, thus prompting {{a return to the}} subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> function.|$|E
