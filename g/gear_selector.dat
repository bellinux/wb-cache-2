25|$|The Australian U13 Bluebirds were {{available}} in three different models, LX—the base model but very well equipped, Ti—the luxury model, and the SSS—the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display—digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, fog lights, ski-port, woodgrain styling, and <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the KA24DE (112kW, 210Nm of torque).|$|E
25|$|Rambler's {{emphasis}} on economy over performance {{can be observed}} through the example of automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to low gear (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 final drive ratio reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy.|$|E

50|$|The car had {{seating for}} five, with an {{adjustable}} {{front bench seat}} with three individual backs, the outer two of which folded {{for access to the}} two armchairs in the back. The backs of the rear armchairs could be folded for extra luggage space. The rear seats were centred such that their occupants could look between the heads of the front passengers for an unobstructed forward view. The <b>gear</b> <b>selectors</b> were extended almost to the rim of the steering wheel for fingertip control, while the speedometer could be switched from miles to kilometres.|$|R
25|$|For each {{keyboard}} digit, {{a sliding}} <b>selector</b> <b>gear,</b> {{much like that}} in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|R

2500|$|For the 1940 model, Oldsmobile was {{the first}} auto {{manufacturer}} to offer a fully automatic transmission, called the [...] "Hydramatic", which features four forward speeds. It has a gas pedal and a brake—no clutch pedal. The <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> is on the steering column.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{standard}} straight-six engine, the Javelin cruised at [...] when {{equipped with an}} automatic transmission, while those with the small [...] V8 had {{a top speed of}} [...] A three-speed [...] "Shift-Command" [...] automatic transmission was optional with a center console-mounted <b>gear</b> <b>selector.</b> Forward settings included [...] "1", [...] "2", and a [...] "D" [...] mode that was fully automatic, and the driver could choose to shift manually through all three gears.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need {{not be the case}} that all of the free-rotating <b>gears</b> with <b>selectors</b> are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the mainshaft, which is the configuration in the 1998 Honda Civic. This means that when the car is stopped and idling in neutral with the clutch engaged and the input shaft spinning, the third, fourth and fifth gear pairs do not rotate.|$|R
50|$|When {{a driver}} {{started to move}} the <b>gear</b> shift knob/gear <b>selector</b> lever, a {{computer-controlled}} actuator operated the clutch. With the car in gear but stationary, the clutch was released only when throttle was applied. If neither brake nor gas pedal was depressed, a warning tone sounded and a message flashed on the on-board display, and if no action was taken after 7 seconds, the engine was shut off.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even speed <b>selector</b> <b>gears.</b> When changing gear, the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.|$|R
2500|$|When the {{floor-mounted}} <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> lever is {{in position}} D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with {{emphasis placed on}} gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy. That means that shifts will change up and down {{very early in the}} rev-range. As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth gear will be engaged around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "sporty" [...] driving style, the adaptive shift pattern will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth gear engages.|$|E
2500|$|Driving trailers, {{also known}} as [...] "control cars" [...] and {{numbered}} in the 61xx series, retained an operative cab and were marshalled {{at the end of}} the train remote from the locomotive. The cab retained most of the original (diesel-mechanical) railcar controls, which were modified to control the (diesel-electric) locomotive; for instance, the <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> became the eight-notch power control. The guard's compartment contained a boiler for train heating and a diesel generator set to supply lights and boiler auxiliaries; because the generator blocked one of the compartment's doors, the guard normally travelled in the corresponding compartment of the connector car.|$|E
2500|$|Stretched in all dimensions, the Premier {{provided}} more interior room {{than any of}} its contemporaries. The interior was an all-new design by AMC's in-house staff {{under the direction of}} Richard A. Teague. It also included features that were considered unique at the time. The instrument panel featured [...] "a heavy dose of electronics", with all driver controls housed within a fingertip distance from the steering wheel. It used an unusual dash mounted <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> with a thin metal lever {{at the end of which}} was a grip handle; instead if the <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> shifting downward in the traditional fashion, the lever dropped into the dash pod in which it was mounted. The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column another control contained the light and windshield wiper controls. The turn signal control was also electronic returning to its centered position immediately after a driver signaled a turn, and a gong indicated its cancellation after completing a turn. The optional cruise control was built into the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other features included intermittent wipers, as well as automatic variable-speed that adjusted wiper speed to the amount of water that hit the windshield; with less moisture, the slower they would move, but increasing their action if a passing truck splashed the windshield with a large amount of water. Standard on all Premiers was an electronically tuned stereo sound system.|$|E
5000|$|Range {{transmissions}} use an [...] "H" [...] pattern {{through a}} narrow range of gears, then a [...] "range" [...] control shifts the [...] "H" [...] pattern {{between high and low}} ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through fourth gears are accessed when low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth <b>gears,</b> the range <b>selector</b> is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through fourth gear positions. In high range, the first gear position becomes fifth, the second gear position becomes sixth, and so on.|$|R
50|$|However, two {{different}} basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds {{corresponding to the}} digit being added or subtracted; a 1 moves the accumulator the slowest, and a 9, the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for 1 is closest to the pivot, of course.For each keyboard digit, a sliding <b>selector</b> <b>gear,</b> much {{like that in the}} Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|The M-3x {{has three}} forward and one reverse <b>gears.</b> The <b>selector</b> lever varies {{depending}} on years and car models the transmission is used in. All models follow a quadrant which has six stations. Early models have two drive positions marked with a [...] "2" [...] and a [...] "1" [...] (P-R-N-D2-D1-L; Park, Reverse, Neutral, D2, D1 and Lock). These models start off in Second gear when in the D2 position. This is useful for economy in relatively flat terrain and for starting on slippery surfaces (wet mud, snow, ice, etc.). When placed in the D1 position the transmission shifts through all three forward gears. In [...] "Lock" [...] the transmission can be locked to prevent upward gear changes and will provide maximum engine braking in 1st gear and moderate engine braking in 2nd gear. By selecting L from stationary, or before an upward gear change into 2nd gear, the transmission will become locked in 1st gear. By selecting L from D2 or D1 while in 2nd gear, the transmission will become locked in 2nd gear or from D2 or D1 when cruising below 55 m.p.h (88 k.p.h.) will effect an immediate downward change and lock in 2nd gear. In both these instances, the transmission will automatically change down into 1st gear when the car speed drops below 5 m.p.h. (8 k.p.h.). Should 1st gear be required earlier, reduce the car speed to below 30 m.p.h. (48 k.p.h.) and effect a [...] "kick-down" [...] gear change. Many people assume they have a two speed transmission because they expect the first Drive position (D2) to shift through all three gears as all automatic transmissions have done since 1968. Some vehicles had the same system without the D1 and D2, instead just having D, and only 5 stations on the quadrant.|$|R
2500|$|... 1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. Each {{of these}} {{featured}} a special badge with an identification number mounted {{next to the}} <b>gear</b> <b>selector,</b> and were finished with a white exterior, wheels, and interior. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer {{to that of the}} base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained {{at the top of the}} rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965 the [...] V8 {{returned}} {{as the standard}} engine, and the [...] "Gran Sport" [...] version made its debut, powered by the Super Wildcat V8 and outfitted with a more aggressive 3.42 axle ratio and stiffer, heavy-duty suspension. The Super Turbine 400 transmission retained its variable pitch torque converter, but was fitted with a three-speed <b>gear</b> <b>selector.</b> The stock dual exhaust pipes were increased from [...] to [...] inside diameter and had fewer turns to reduce backpressure. [...] Externally, the headlamps were hidden behind clamshell doors in the leading edges of each fender, as {{had been in the}} original design. The non-functional side scoops between the doors and rear wheel arches were removed, and the taillights moved from the body into the rear bumper. A vinyl roof became available as an option, initially offered only in black, and the tilt steering wheel optional in previous years was now standard equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The second-generation Marlin did {{not have}} its own catalog, but was {{described}} within the large Ambassador sales brochure. The Ambassador's standard features and options also came on the Marlin. The interiors continued to offer premium materials and fittings, including wood-grain trim, and {{were the same as}} on the Ambassador 990 and DPL two-door hardtop models (with the exception of the [...] "Custom" [...] package that had two matching pillows) that [...] "rival more expensive cars for luxury and quality, yet are durable enough to take years of normal wear." [...] Many Marlins were ordered with the reclining buckets seats that not only featured a center armrest between them (with a center cushion for a third occupant or a floor console with <b>gear</b> <b>selector),</b> but also a foldaway center armrest for the rear seat. The interior design was new and featured a safety-oriented dashboard with the instruments and controls grouped in front of the driver, {{while the rest of the}} dash was pushed forward and away from the passengers. Protruding knobs and controls were eliminated from any area that the passenger or driver could strike them. The steering wheel was smaller than used before and the column was now designed to collapse under impact. A new lane change feature was made standard for the turn signal.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992 {{models were}} similar to 1991s - {{the only way to}} tell the {{difference}} is the rear back glass (the rear glass does not have any trim to which two black buttons serve as the back glass strut mounting points) and front grille (chrome shell with argent silver inserts). The interior was a carryover from 1991 {{with the exception of the}} center console and steering wheel (X-bar style similar to the one used in the GMT400 trucks). Also, the [...] "S-15" [...] name was dropped from the Jimmy. The S10 Blazer also introduced an upscale Tahoe trim package, the Tahoe LT, which was rebadged as the LT in 1995 whilst the Tahoe package was renamed as the LS. The Tahoe LT had its own exterior décor with faded lower body lines on the lower rockers along with Tahoe LT badges - this also included an overhead console and keyless remote door locks). 1992 was the first model year where the S10 Blazer and Jimmy offered an NP233 electronic transfer case for as a drive train option. This deleted the Manual <b>gear</b> range <b>selector</b> with a 3 position switch located to the left of the gauge cluster in the same location that the rear defrost button would be located on non-electronic transfer-case and 2WD model Blazers and Jimmies (when optioned with the electronic transfer case the defrost button assembly is positioned below the headlight switch). The electronic transfer-case added luxury however there was no neutral position with the electronic transfer case, so the owner's manual stated that the drive shaft had to be removed when the vehicle was being towed. The fuel lines, which were routed on the driver side frame rail to the TBI fuel injectors, were redesigned where the fuel inlets entered the rear of the engine (same as the GMT400). This was phased in because of the L35 option which used a similar fuel line setup. The serpentine accessory drive for the 4.3L motor was modified where the air pump was eliminated and further lightened.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{inspired}} by, {{and positioned}} directly against, the Corvette, Ford billed the Thunderbird {{as a personal}} car, putting {{a greater emphasis on}} the car's comfort and convenience features rather than its inherent sportiness. The Thunderbird sold exceptionally well in its first year. In fact, the Thunderbird outsold the Corvette by more than 23-to-one for 1955 with 16,155 Thunderbirds sold against 700 Corvettes. With the Thunderbird considered a success, few changes were made to the car for 1956. The most notable change was moving the spare tire to a continental-style rear bumper in order to make more storage room in the trunk and a new 12 volt electrical system. The addition of the weight at the rear caused steering issues. Among the few other changes were new paint colors, the addition of circular porthole windows as standard in the fiberglass roof to improve rearward visibility, and a [...] Y-block V8 making [...] when mated to a 3-speed manual transmission or [...] when mated to a Ford-O-Matic 2-speed automatic transmission; this transmission featured a [...] "low gear", which was accessible only via the <b>gear</b> <b>selector.</b> When in [...] "Drive", it was a 2-speed automatic transmission (similar to Chevrolet's Powerglide).(Low gear could also be accessed with wide open throttle.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 the Oldsmobile 98 again had {{a longer}} {{wheelbase}} than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, {{front and rear}} floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer. Upholstery choices were covert and pattern cloth, leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather.

The Hydramatic automatic transmission <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E
