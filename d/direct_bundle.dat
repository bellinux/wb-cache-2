40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{method for}} automatically segmenting white matter bundles in diffusion-weighted MRI is tractography {{in conjunction with}} streamline cluster selection.

40|$|Bundling, {{the process}} of {{transporting}} goods belonging to different flows in a common vehicle (like train, barge or truck) or other unit during part of their journey, is a core business of the transport sector. Operators periodically evaluate their service networks and adjust their bundling operations. The adjustments respond to changing cost structures, changing competition and changing situations in terms of demand and performance requirements. One can distinguish <b>direct</b> <b>bundling</b> from different types of complex bundling, such as hub-and-spoke or line bundling. Complex bundling networks have intermediate exchange nodes and longer routes, but less vehicle routes. The latter means that required network volumes could be lower, service frequencies higher or vehicle loads larger. In this sense, complex bundling allows smaller flows {{to participate in the}} advantages of large-scale operations and therefore is an important option to successfully develop intermodal transport. The additional impedance of complex bundling networks has been and still is an incentive for intermodal rail freight operators to switch from complex to <b>direct</b> <b>bundling.</b> However, the flow sizes of many rail relations are too small for <b>direct</b> <b>bundling.</b> If nevertheless <b>direct</b> <b>bundling</b> is applied, trainloads or service frequencies decline and/or small flows will shift to the road sector...|$|R

40|$|The {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP) histochemical technique {{was used to}} examine the peripheral distribution and afferent projections of the trigeminal nerve in the goldfish, Carassius auratus. Sensory fibers of the trigeminal nerve distribute over the head via four branches. The ophthalmic branch distributes fibers to the region above the eye and naris. The maxillary and mandibular branches innervate the regions of the upper and lower lip, respectively. A fourth branch of the trigeminal nerve was demonstrated to be present in the hyomandibular trunk. Upon entering the medulla the trigeminal afferent fibers divide into a rostromedially <b>directed</b> <b>bundle</b> and a caudally <b>directed</b> <b>bundle.</b> The rostromedially <b>directed</b> <b>bundle</b> terminates in the sensory trigeminal nucleus (STN) located within the rostral medulla. The majority of fibers turn caudally, forming the descending trigeminal tract. Fibers of the descending trigeminal tract terminate within three medullary nuclei: the nucleus of the descending trigeminal tract (NDTV), the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Spv), and the medial funicular nucleus (MFn). All projections, except for those to the MFn, are ipsilateral. Contralateral projections were observed {{at the level of the}} MFn following the labeling of the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular branches. All branches of the trigeminal nerve project to all four of the trigeminal medullary nuclei. Projections to the STN and MFn were found to be topographically organized such that the afferents of the ophthalmic branch project onto the ventral portion of these nuclei, while the afferents of the maxillo- and hyomandibular branches project to the dorsal portion of these nuclei. Cells of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were retrogradely labeled following HRP application to the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve. In addition to demonstrating the ascending mesencephalic trigeminal root fibers, HRP application to the above-mentioned branches also revealed descending mesencephalic trigeminal fibers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An apparatus for the {{detection of}} material layer(s) (2) on a technical surface (1), comprises a lamp (3) which <b>directs</b> a <b>bundled</b> light beam (6) at the material on the surface. Detector(s) (4) register the fluorescent radiation (9) generated by the material through the illumination. The bundled light beam forms a point or linear pattern on the surface forming an enclosed angle with it of 0 deg. at most alpha at most 90 deg.. The detector forms a position resolution camera system with a camera viewing direction (8) forming an enclosed angle with the surface of 0 deg. at most beta at most 90 deg.. alpha and beta are unequal. The surface can be moved in relation to the bundled light beam. USE - The apparatus is {{for the detection}} of fluorescence generated from layer(s) of material on a technical surface which is classified according to its purity or the type or degree of contamination. It is used to give a qualitative or quantitative measurement of organic residue or soiling on a non-fluorescent technical surface, is useful as a quality check of finished and/or semi-finished products, and is also useful for registering the presence of insulation residue on an electrical contact surface area cleared of insulation.

This paper studies the geometry of the space of Kähler metrics of a compact Kähler manifold, using techniques and tools from the author’s previous work [Ann. of Math. (2) 169 (2009), no. 2, 531 – 560; MR 2480611]. In particular, the author shows that L 2 - ∂ techniques {{can be used in}} the context of Kähler geometry to prove striking new theorems. Some results about positivity of <b>direct</b> image <b>bundles</b> on trivial holomorphic fibrations over a one-dimensional base proved in [op. cit. ] are re-proved here and then used. The main application of these results is to the problem of approximating geodesics in the space of Kähler metrics on a polarized manifold using geodesics in the finite-dimensional spaces of Bergman metrics. The setup is similar to the one considered by D. H. Phong and J. Sturm [Invent. Math. 166 (2006), no. 1, 125 – 149; MR 2242635 (2007 h: 32036) ], although it is not exactly the same. In this context, the author shows that the finite-dimensional Bergman geodesics converge uniformly to a weak geodesic in the space of Kähler metrics, with a definite bound on the rate of convergence. Very recently, the author has extended his techniques to get the same result in the same setting as that of Phong and Sturm, thus improving their results [see “Probability measures related to geodesics in the space of Kähler metrics”, preprint, arxiv. org/abs/ 0907. 1806]...|$|R
