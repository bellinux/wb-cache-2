40|$|Ascending {{into the}} {{executive}} level {{of an organization}} {{can be considered a}} crowning achievement in one’s profession. It is usually a position in which those most qualified could ultimately arrive. Yet, some organizations, particularly within the U. S. federal government, claim that coveted executive positions are remaining vacant or are not being filled as readily as has traditionally occurred. Even with programs available for a person to become more qualified for advancement, the positions remain unfilled. The level at which employees traditionally qualify for executive positions is the level at which fewer seem to be applying for those positions. In other words, it appears that potential executive candidates are refusing to advance into executive vacancies, which {{is often referred to as}} the progression paradox. An organization unable to promote <b>employee</b> <b>advancement</b> into executive vacancies could potentially inhibit its own progression. The ideas of position qualification and position refusal are two concepts that have not been studied collectively nor received the level of scrutiny that is perhaps needed to answer the fundamental question: Why are gaps in executive-level positions not being filled as expected? Therefore, the researcher utilized grounded-theory analysis to develop a theory into whether adequately defined capabilities freely and clearly enable <b>employee</b> <b>advancement</b> into executive leadership levels. This study delved into the literature and reviewed several inquiries made into the personal perspectives of employees at various levels throughout a Department of Defense agency regarding constructs that could affect ascension into executive leadership ranks. The researcher then built on the findings from these inquiries to create a model of alignment with an organization’s core purpose. Essentially, this research offers an increased understanding into the mask of ambiguity that inhibits progression and identifies the elements needed to assist qualified employees who are refusing to advance into executive vacancies...|$|E
30|$|Studies using online job {{advertisements}} {{differ from}} those relying on printed job adverts typically {{in the number of}} ads they analysed and, relatedly, in the techniques they are able to employ. A leading private internet recruitment site – Monster.com – {{has been used as a}} source of online job vacancy data in various studies. Capiluppi and Baravalle (2010) developed a ‘web spider’ to download vacancies from the Monster.com website and then analysed the skills required of IT personnel in the UK using content analysis. They found a mismatch between requirements of UK industry and offer of educational and training institutions. Backhaus (2004) analysed job advertisements from Monster.com from the perspective of employers. Using content analysis she studied corporate descriptions in job adverts to understand aspects of company branding and marketing in human resources, pioneering this type of research. She finds that firms focus more on presenting company characteristics than <b>employee</b> <b>advancement</b> and that differences exist across firms in different industries in their recruitment tactics.|$|E

These centres comprise {{of a number of}} instruments which {{are used to}} establish competencies needed to perform effectively. The validity of this measure is yet to be fully ascertained as previous studies have shown that although assessment centres have predictive validity, they lack construct validity. The research study therefore set out to establish whether assessment centres used within financial institutions have predictive validity but lack construct validity. For purposes of this study, two sets of data each comprising of responses from 120 and 91 employees were used. This data was retrieved from a financial institution within the Western Cape. Contrary to previous studies, there was low predictive validity within this study. Some of the factors that could have contributed to the low correlation between performance and assessment ratings include a rather small sample that was used, having different criterion being measured in the evaluations than in the assessment centres, range restriction, complexity of assessing behaviour, and having a number of dimensions from which to derive an Overall Assessment Rating (OAR). However, similar to previous studies, this study also found low construct validity amongst the ratings. In addition, a further analysis indicated that both performance and personality measures are valid methods in predicting performance...|$|E

Primarily, the study aims to {{determine the influence of}} training and of emotional intelligence (EI) on the <b>employee’s</b> <b>advancement</b> up the career ladder. Second, the study aims to clarify the relationships between EI and different demographic variables within a Lebanese organizational context. Design – Literature review and quantitative research methodology consisting of an esurvey completed by 131 employees via snowball sampling. The survey gathered information about the employees’ demographics, their perceptions of available training opportunities, their emotional intelligence levels, and their structural career plateauing levels. The primary data obtained were analyzed via SPSS through descriptive (frequencies and means) and inferential statistics (independent sample t-tests, correlation analyses, and regression analysis). Six hypotheses were examined. Findings – Training was negatively correlated to structural career plateauing. EI was not correlated to structural career plateauing. Men and women had comparable EI levels. Age, work experience and work position were not correlated to EI. Married employees had significantly higher EI levels than single employees. Originality – The study provides invaluable insights regarding EI in Lebanon, a research field that still has a lot to uncover. It is a worthy addition to the literature on structural career plateauing and on EI in an organizational context. N/A 12 M 1 hard copy: x, 87 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aims: Career {{advancement}} {{can lead}} to productivity and success of educational canters and universities. Academic employees have {{a significant role in}} the community education and social development. Success in universities depends on academic <b>employee's</b> career <b>advancement</b> and quality of workplace. Quality of work life (QWL) views the organizational environment in accordance with employees’ needs (health and safety, economic and family, social, esteem, actualization, knowledge and aesthetic). This study investigated the relationship between QWL and career <b>advancement</b> among academic <b>employees</b> in Hamadan, Iran. MethodsThe structured questionnaires were based on information of 307 randomly selected academics in two Hamadan public universities in year 2013. The data collection was based on a self-administered questionnaire including background characteristics, seven dimensions of quality of work life and four dimensions of career advancement. Data was analyzed with structural equation modelling (AMOS) method. ResultsThe mean age of respondents was 39. 67 (7. 4) years. Most of them had Ph. D (70 %) and 30 % had M. Sc. educational level. Majority of respondents perceived moderate level of QWL (73 %) and perceived high level of career advancement (62. 2 %). The results of the patch analysis showed that quality of work life and career advancement was significantly and positively related (ß=. 28, P=. 039). ConclusionsIt can be concluded that there was a positive and significant relationship between quality of work life and career advancement. The results of the study supported this idea that higher quality of work life lead to higher career advancement.

(Leadership in Performance and Change) This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the factors affecting retention of employees in a global markets division of an investment bank comprising 500 employees. The research is quantitative in nature. Five factors are discussed and used as basis to see which factors contribute the most to retention of employees. These factors are remuneration, the job, {{the profile of the}} organisation, organisational processes and leadership style. Sub-factors relating to these factors were identified and discussed by way of a literature review. A questionnaire was compiled based on the five factors and the sub-factors in relation to the retention of employees.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. This dissertation covers two distinct but related topics in Labor Economics: promotion within firms and inequality in education. The first chapter develops a new model that explains why many firms do not favor their own <b>employees</b> for <b>advancement.</b> In equilibrium, some, but not all firms commit to promote internally. These "promotion" firms attract higher quality employees to entry-level jobs, which in turn makes the firm more likely to get skilled workers in upper level jobs. Non-promotion firms benefit by paying lower wages. This divergence in strategies reflects the scarcity of high-quality workers. The model generates several testable predictions regarding the differences in wages and the return to tenure between promotion and non-promotion firms. I confirm these predictions empirically using a matched employer-employee data set from the UK. Chapter two analyzes how the way we measure achievement affects estimates of the black-white test gap among young children. Although both economists and psychometricians typically treat test scores as interval scales, they are reported using ordinal scales. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey to examine the effect of order-preserving scale transformations on the evolution of the black-white reading test score gap from kindergarten entry through third grade. Plausible transformations reverse the growth of the gap in the CNLSY and greatly reduce it in the ECLS-K during the early school years. All growth from entry through first grade and a nontrivial proportion from first to third grade probably reflects scaling decisions. To address the measurement problems demonstrated in chapter two, in chapter three we relate test scores to adult outcomes. Using data from the CNLSY, we perform order-preserving scale transformations on reading and math test scores to maximize their ability to predict completed education. We find that the black-white achievement gap grows {{during the early years of}} education when measured in terms of test scores' economic value. Classical measurement error is insufficient to explain the growth in the gap...|$|R

GTS has been mandated to deliver global cash management, trade and custody services and account services to large corporates in the jurisdictions where FirstRand operates. Technology advances in centralising operating structures, {{have made it}} possible for GTS to centralise back office operations to a few locations within the country as witnessed by Global banks like Citigroup. The research problem therefore was to evaluate and identify the strengths as well as shortfalls of the current decentralised operating model versus a proposed approach towards a centralised operating model within the GTS {{business unit}}; focusing on investigating whether outsourcing IT operations and technology would create efficiencies, attract skilled <b>employees</b> and technological <b>advancement</b> to the division. Primary objective of the research was to evaluate the current decentralised operating model. Secondary objective was to evaluate the gains associated with implementing a central operating model against the gains currently derived from the decentralised operating model. The findings derived from the study suggest that: (i) There is a misalignment between the business strategy and IT strategy within the current operating model resulting in IT playing a supporting role and not an enabling role in the business strategy formulation and implementation. (ii) The bank does not engage in an on-going activity to evaluate processes, procedures and technology making it difficult to streamline and automate processes resulting in a lot of manual processing.

40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{education}} in the United States currently face a growing budget crisis as public funding steadily diminishes while costs skyrocket (Rosenstone, 2004). Increasingly, institutions are turning to fundraising to offset lagging revenues (Carnesale, 2000), because tuition increases are becoming untenable (Spencer, 2002). While critical to financing higher education, the fundraising field itself faces significant challenges. Fundraisers most commonly cite staffing and leadership dilemmas within their own development offices as most problematic (Association of Fundraising Professionals, 2007). ^ Fundraising has become a highly professionalized and mobile field. Yet, attracting and retaining top talent are issues that plague all nonprofits (Herbst, 2005), particularly at leadership levels (Baldwin, 2007; Bell et al., 2006; Stannard-Friel, 2007). Coupled with these challenges is the possibility of a glass ceiling in fundraising – a term symbolizing instances in which women and minorities are prevented from attaining top leadership positions in organizations solely because of gender or race (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2004). Women comprise the majority of all <b>advancement</b> <b>employees</b> (Taylor, 2005), yet are generally undercompensated as compared to their male colleagues and also underrepresented in nonprofit leadership ranks (Gibelman, 2000; Sampson 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 2006). This raises the question of why, {{in the midst of a}} staffing crisis, greater numbers of women are not promoted to fill the current overabundance of vacant positions. ^ The literature offers many potential theories to explain female undercompensation and underrepresentation in advancement leadership; however, these theories vary widely from intentional gender bias (Sampson 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 2006) to personal choices made by women themselves (Joslyn, 2003). This mixed methodology research study employed a questionnaire and follow-up focus group interviews with female advancement professionals to discover if women in higher education advancement perceive that they are affected by a true glass ceiling, or whether other factors, such as opting-out, may instead be responsible for female undercompensation and underrepresentation in their field. By understanding the motivations and aspirations of women in higher education advancement today, effective solutions can be implemented to inform advancement leadership, to enhance the available talent pipeline, and to provide opportunities for professional development leading to staff success and loyalty. ...|$|R

The major cause of this ugly practice is the increase of economic crimes due to uncontrolled economy which affects money supply, causes inflation and affects other macroeconomic indices adversely. This research therefore reviews the challenges facing commercial banks in combating ML in Tanzania and the ways to curb/mitigate them. To explore these themes, primary and secondary sources of data were used. The questionnaires raised were distributed upon a sample size drawn from the population of some selected banks ie. NBC Ltd. Findings showed that money laundering is in increasing in commercial banks in Tanzania despite the efforts done by the Government to curb it. It is concluded that ML is a critical problem to the banking operations, and that, politicians {{play a key role in}} making the efforts towards effectively fighting of these practices unachievable dream. Political will are strong needed if the fights against ML is to be achieved. This is because ML practices have a lot of negative consequences to the economy. It is clear therefore that ML practices are dangerous and well-coordinated efforts towards fighting these practices are needed.

40|$|Supervisor attributes, such as race or gender, {{are thought}} to play an {{important}} role in <b>employee</b> hiring, career <b>advancement</b> and turnover even in the absence of discrimination. For example, supervisors may be better able to infer the true ability of a worker if they have a common attribute (Cornell and Welch 1996) or it could be that mentoring is an important determinant of employees' career trajectories and is more effective if the workers and supervisors are of the same type (Athey, Avery and Zemsky 2000). Embedded in this idea are important policy implications for alleviating the gender wage gap and other adverse career outcomes for females. In our paper we introduce a type-based mentoring model of worker productivity and turnover in which human capital production is contingent on the worker's gender and the supervisor's type. We allow for a flexible definition of "type" based on the supervisor's attitude toward working with females. Using a longitudinal data set in which workers with a high level of managerial responsibility are observed at multiple establishments over time, we construct a measure of revealed supervisor female-friendliness above and beyond the institution-specific culture by comparing changes in the gender composition of workers at lower levels of the firm. We adjust the measure to account for its potential endogeneity with respect to the outcomes that we study and use it to test empirically the predictions of a type-based mentoring model against a model of pure taste-based discrimination. We add to the literature by proposing the idea that it may be necessary to be more flexible when defining "type" in the mentoring relationship. We argue that, in addition to demographics, supervisors can be characterized by a more complexly defined inherent attitude toward working with and mentoring females, which can vary within observable supervisor characteristics, and that the existing literature has left unexplored areas by limiting its focus on leaders' observable characteristics. Implementing our definition of female-friendliness empirically requires us to use a novel data set with information on both supervisors and lower-level workers, in which high-level managerial employees are followed across establishments. We link the theoretical idea of type-based mentoring to observed career outcomes and test whether females are more likely to benefit in terms of career progression when matched with a supervisor with a more favorable attitude toward mentoring women. While our study focuses on a very specific labor market setting, described in Section 3, our findings offer strong support for the importance of type-based mentoring in the labor market and in addition should motivate researchers to use broader definitions of "type" that include harder to infer attitudes in addition to directly observable supervisor and worker attributes such as gender. gender; labor marke...|$|R
