40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore the {{characteristics}} of self-improvement books as a genre. Although self-improvement books are a widely read genre, particularly in the Western world, none to my knowledge has examined the linguistic features of this genre in detail. The thesis draws on the three main schools of genre theory: English for Specific Purposes, Systemic Functional Linguistics, and the New Rhetoric, and begins by investigating the sections (e. g., acknowledgement, introduction chapter) in self-improvement books and the typicality of the sections. Focusing on three sections: <b>introduction</b> <b>chapters,</b> body chapters, and about the author sections, the thesis examines how authors structure the sections by analysing the moves and steps. This study also examines the stories in self-improvement books by analysing {{the purpose of the}} stories and their structure. Stories were chosen because they seemed to be a feature of self-improvement books based on my observation and as suggested by interview data. To analyse self-improvement books at a register level, the thesis examines the most unambiguous aspects of engagement: personal pronouns focusing on you, imperative clauses, and questions. It also examines the lexicogrammatical features of self-improvement book titles and compares them to the titles of historical biographies, showing that imperative clauses and ing-clause are found only in self-improvement book titles. Drawing on interview data and literature on the American Dream, American individualism, Neoliberalism, and New Age beliefs, the thesis explains how the linguistic characteristics of the genre of self-improvement books reflect these ideologies. The dataset for the study is 40 self-improvement books, {{selected on the basis of}} a set of criteria that I developed. Subsets were selected from the main dataset for specific analyses. The text analysis part of the study is supplemented by interview data from specialist informants, who come from three categories: readers of the genre, non-readers of the genre, and authors of the genre. Move analysis identifies obligatory rhetorical moves and indicates that the main purposes of <b>introduction</b> <b>chapters</b> and about the author sections are persuading readers to read the book, and establishing credibility, respectively. Authors always persuade readers to read their books by listing reasons to read them. To demonstrate authors’ credibility, they refer to their areas of expertise. Unlike the <b>introduction</b> <b>chapters</b> and about the author sections, the body chapters have more than one obligatory rhetorical move. The body chapters present the problem that readers potentially experience, present the authors’ message, recommend practical applications, and encourage readers to apply them. From a genre perspective, the purpose of all the stories in my analysis is to illustrate the authors’ message. Register analysis, and drawing on interview data, suggests that authors use the personal pronoun you, imperative clauses, and questions to engage readers. The abundance of the personal pronoun you suggests that self-improvement books are a reader-oriented genre. The analysis of the imperative clauses using Halliday’s process types suggests that the main way to improve our lives, the authors recommend, is to change how we think. Finally, my thesis shows that the social purpose of self-improvement books is to help potential readers improve their lives, and the approach of improving one’s life has an individualistic orientation...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that writing a thesis is a challenging task for both native and non-native English speaking students. Despite {{a considerable number of}} studies on this specific genre elsewhere, there is a scarcity of work in Vietnam to help TESOL students to write a thesis. Furthermore, the Introduction is considered one of two most difficult chapters to write. This paper, therefore, presents a study on the rhetorical structure of <b>Introduction</b> <b>chapters</b> of twelve M. A. theses from the three universities in the South of Vietnam. Employing the modified CARS’ model by Bunton (2002), the results showed that three moves and 15 steps were employed by this group of non-native English writers {{despite the fact that they}} had little or no formal instruction on how to write this genre. Additionally, a new step was also identified in this corpus. These findings reflect Vietnamese students’ ability to conform to the norms and to adapt the norms to suit cultural expectations. This paper proposes practical implications for teaching this particular group of novice writers in Vietnam as well as in settings with similar cultural values on how to compose the Introduction section...|$|E

Chapter six focuses on the Malacca Straits region's maritime state-level diplomatic and trade exchanges with China, against the backdrop of changes in China's view and administration of maritime trade. Chapter seven examines the general trends that occurred in the trade in Malacca Straits region products to China. Chapter eight details the developments in the trade of key categories of Chinese products to the Malacca Straits region, and examines the changing patterns of the Chinese products trade at the regional and sub-regional levels.

WordNet supports both of these functions and thus deserves careful study by the digital library community.

40|$|The aim of {{this first}} part of two <b>introduction</b> <b>chapters</b> is to discuss {{features}} of critical studies of educational policy within the broader field of policy studies and in relation to sociological, political and philosophical research on education. The point of departure is the so-called “policy orientation” in social research, {{and the emergence of}} policy analysis and its concern within the welfare state. The sphere and genre of critical educational policy studies {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s was mainly rooted in sociological, historical, and political research on education, that is, the research tradition interested in the power, politics and (social) regulation in and around schools. Echoing the term “policy orientation”, we want to introduce the notion critical education policy orientation to describe the distinctive scope of critical education policy studies. In this chapter we will not present either detailed definitions of and illuminating linkages between the main concepts in research traditions nor exhaustive overviews and final accounts of perspectives, theories and methods. The aim instead is to offer some general overviews of approaches and discussions for the purpose of bringing some matters of concern in the diversity of studies critically oriented towards educational policy to the foreground...|$|E
40|$|The {{lecture notes}} {{in this book}} {{are based on the}} TCC (Taught Course Centre for graduates) course given by the author in Trinity Terms of 2009 2011 at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. It {{contains}} more or less an elementary introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier Stokes equations as well as the modern regularity theory for them. The latter is developed by means of the classical PDE's theory in the style that is quite typical for St Petersburg's mathematical school of the Navier Stokes equations. The global unique solvability (well-posedness) of initial boundary value problems for the Navier Stokes equations is in fact one of the seven Millennium problems stated by the Clay Mathematical Institute in 2000. It has not been solved yet. However, a deep connection between regularity and well-posedness is known and can be used to attack the above challenging problem. This type of approach is not very well presented in the modern books on the mathematical theory of the Navier Stokes equations.
