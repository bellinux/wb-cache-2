500|$|Ram Charan {{decided not}} to debut in Bollywood with Magadheeras Hindi remake, as he {{believed}} the film might not be recreated well.

Since the year 2000, when we began Plan Colombia, the United States has provided more than $3 billion in vital aid. We'll continue providing aid. We've helped Colombia to strengthen its democracy, to combat drug production, to create a more transparent and effective judicial system, to increase the size and professionalism of its military and police forces, to protect human rights, and to reduce corruption. Mr. President, you and your government have not let us down.

2500|$|In the Plame affair, Scooter Libby, convicted {{chief of}} staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, told special {{prosecutor}} Patrick Fitzgerald that Russert told him of the identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame (who is married to former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson). Russert testified previously, and again in United States v. I. Lewis Libby, that he would neither testify whether he spoke with Libby nor would he describe the conversation. Russert did say, however, that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was not leaked to him. Russert testified again in the trial on February 7, 2007. According to the Washington Post, Russert testified that [...] "when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record," [...] saying: [...] "when I talk to senior government officials on the phone, it's my own policy our conversations are confidential.

2500|$|The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, {{follows the}} {{traditional}} Tibetan Buddhist assertion that inappropriate sexual behaviour includes {{lesbian and gay}} sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one's own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation. In a 1994 interview, he stated: [...] "If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'." [...] However, in his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he states, [...] "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper {{is the use of}} organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was noted}} that Mayor Koch held steadfast in {{his support of}} Ward. [...] Although Koch said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the {{videotape}} of the police response, {{as he had done}} in the past he refused to utter a negative word about Ward. [...] "The day I think that a commissioner, including a police commissioner, isn't as good as he should be to run whatever he's running, that's the day <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> him to submit his resignation," [...] said Koch. [...] "I think Ben Ward will go down {{as one of the greatest}} police commissioners this city has ever had. Bob McGuire is the other, and I appointed both of them." [...] However, Koch's support eroded as evidence mounted that municipal disorganization and a lack of police leadership that night likely sparked the riots. [...] "The film that I saw causes me to believe that there may have been an overreaction. I was not happy with what I saw on film. [...] Those films were disturbing to me, and I think they disturbed Ben Ward as well." ...|$|E
