5|$|The Original E-Series Clubsport was {{released}} in September 2006. The Clubsport had LED taillights and vertical front fender <b>grilles</b> only found on HSV E-Series models. Cloth trim was standard on Clubsport models with leather being an option.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh {{chose the}} guest {{house in which}} the protagonist stays after noticing it {{during his visit to}} a {{neighbouring}} hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for , and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer <b>grilles</b> with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} SSG commandos from ventilation <b>grilles</b> in the basement. During the firefight, Abdul Rashid Ghazi {{was shot in the}} leg and was asked to surrender. However, militants in the room fired back at the SSG, and Ghazi was killed in the crossfire. Other reports say that Ghazi came out of a bunker to surrender, only to be shot by his own forces. The fighting continued until all the personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|E
50|$|Clearly, in {{the case}} of {{communication}} by <b>grille</b> cipher, both sender and recipient must possess an identical copy of the <b>grille.</b> The loss of a <b>grille</b> leads to the probable loss of all secret correspondence encrypted with that <b>grille.</b> Either the messages cannot be read (i.e., decrypted) or someone else (with the lost <b>grille)</b> may be reading them.|$|R
50|$|Externally, the BMW 'kidney' <b>grille</b> {{indicated}} which {{engine was}} present under the hood: all 6-cylinder models have a narrow <b>grille,</b> and a wider <b>grille</b> was {{standard for the}} V8 and V12 models. The narrow <b>grille</b> was available as an option on the 8- and 12-cylinder E32 models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, {{as part of}} the {{introduction}} of the Mercury Mountaineer SUV, Mercury reintroduced the chrome vertical [...] "waterfall" [...] <b>grille.</b> In place of the radiator-style <b>grille</b> of Lincoln, several <b>grille</b> shapes were initially used, before the division adapted a rectangular <b>grille</b> opening in the mid-2000s.|$|R
5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from {{pipes and}} can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as <b>grilles,</b> cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with <b>grilles</b> to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey west range {{contains}} the main entrance, which enters the courtyard via an arched passage. Above the outside gate are spaces where armorial panels were once displayed. The windows on this front, {{larger than the}} original ones in the tower house, had iron <b>grilles,</b> and small gun holes beneath them. Beside the entrance was a kitchen, and above, a larger hall and drawing room. Only {{the western part of}} the three-storey north range was completed, although the Lindsays planned to complete the courtyard. This range had another kitchen, as well as private chambers within the round tower at the north-west corner. It was entered via a stair turret in the courtyard, fragments of which remain, including parts of an intricately carved door surround. Only the foundations of the east and south buildings remain, which probably contained a bakehouse and stables.|$|E
50|$|The OEM <b>grille</b> {{must first}} be removed and then the {{replacement}} billet <b>grille</b> must be mounted {{in place of the}} OEM <b>grille.</b> Drilling and sometimes cutting is required for this method. Installation instructions are always provided by the <b>grille</b> manufacturer, but unless you are a handyman you will need to take this job to a professional garage.|$|R
25|$|The front <b>grille</b> of {{a vehicle}} is used to direct air {{directly}} into the engine compartment. In a streamlined design the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the <b>grille</b> {{of a vehicle}} redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a <b>grille</b> block is often used. A <b>grille</b> block covers up a portion, or {{the entirety of the}} front <b>grille</b> of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or vehicles with low drag coefficients there will be a very small <b>grille</b> already built into the design, therefore a <b>grille</b> block is unneeded. The <b>grille</b> in most production vehicles is built generally to have as much air flowing into the engine compartment in order to keep it from overheating. But most commonly there is too much airflow into the engine compartment, preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, so a <b>grille</b> block is used to increase engine performance and reduce the vehicle's drag.|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{levels were}} base, Standard, and Super Deluxe. The base version has no front <b>grille,</b> the Standard has a black <b>grille,</b> while the Super Deluxe {{features}} chrome trim on the <b>grille</b> {{as well as}} chromed hubcaps.|$|R
5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron <b>grilles</b> and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker <b>grilles</b> behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker <b>grilles.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 1982 {{model year}} {{was marked by}} a slight but {{important}} cosmetic change: 1982-86 models had the [...] "FORD" [...] letters above the <b>grille</b> removed, and a Ford oval placed {{in the center of}} the <b>grille,</b> with fewer vertical bars in the <b>grille</b> itself. This made the 1982 the first model year to feature the Blue Oval on the front, a trademark of all Ford pickups since, with the exception of the 2010-present F-150 SVT Raptor. The frame was strengthened and the trucks became heavier for 1982; this frame would underpin the F-Series until the 1997 redesign. <b>Grille</b> options included a full chrome <b>grille,</b> a black <b>grille</b> or the standard flat grey plastic <b>grille.</b> The headlight bezels also came in several color options, ranging from light grey, grey, dark grey, and black; with the latter two being the most common.|$|R
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing <b>grilles</b> on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and <b>grilles</b> and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is well detailed and executed with dark stained timber joinery throughout, {{except for the}} contrasting honey-coloured boards that line the raked ceiling. Finely detailed trusses, supported on concrete corbels, incorporate semi-circular laminated arches of three vertical layers, bolted and strapped together at intervals. Within the semi-circular apse, the ceiling boards are tapered to a narrow point to form a conical peak. Decorative timber <b>grilles</b> along {{the apex of the}} nave and chancel ceiling combined with metal <b>grilles</b> in the chancel window sills are elements of the original ventilation system.|$|E
25|$|The styling {{was mostly}} {{unchanged}} for the 1971 models, save for minor revisions to trim and the <b>grilles.</b> The <b>grilles</b> on the 1971 Torinos now were divided by a vertical {{division in the}} centre of the grille for all models except the Cobra. The Cobra continued to use the same grille as used in 1970. A revised emblem was located on the vertical divider on the grille for all Torinos except the Cobra. The Torino 500, Brougham, Squire wagon and GT models had the Hideaway headlamp option available, which included a unique grille with a less prominent divider bar.|$|E
