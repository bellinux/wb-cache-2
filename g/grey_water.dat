25|$|For {{additional}} {{treatment of}} bilge, <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> and engine water, the Benjamin Franklin is fitted {{with an additional}} decanting tank. This decanting tank is able to separate water from undesirable liquids, by letting all of the liquids settle. The waste products in the liquids are then removed and the remaining liquid is sent for further filtering.|$|E
25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal <b>grey</b> <b>water.</b> Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the design was that it would also be a sustainable building. This commitment to the environment is an increasingly significant part of North Shore City Council's approach to urban development, especially through the Resource Management Act and the Treaty of Waitangi. It aims to lead by example with best practices. The library design incorporated several notable features, including the maximisation of natural light, the use of recyclable material, including reuse of <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> and a natural ventilation and cooling system to limit energy costs.|$|E
40|$|Efficient and {{economic}} {{reuse of waste}} {{is one of the}} pillars of modern environmental engineering. In the field of domestic sewage management, source separation of yellow (urine), brown (faecal matter) and <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> aims to recover the organic substances concentrated in brown water, the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) in the urine and to ensure an easier treatment and recycling of <b>grey</b> <b>waters.</b> With the objective of emphasizing the potential of recovery of resources from sewage management, a lab-scale research study was carried out at the University of Padova in order to evaluate the performances of oleaginous plants (suitable for biodiesel production) in the phytotreatment of source separated yellow and <b>grey</b> <b>waters.</b> The plant species used were Brassica napus (rapeseed), Glycine max (soybean) and Helianthus annuus (sunflower). Phytotreatment tests were carried out using 20 L pots. Different testing runs were performed at an increasing nitrogen concentration in the feedstock. The results proved that oleaginous species can conveniently be used for the phytotreatment of <b>grey</b> and yellow <b>waters</b> from source separation of domestic sewage, displaying high removal efficiencies of nutrients and organic substances (nitrogen > 80...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAir source {{heat pumps}} {{driven by a}} gas engine is a known technology. In this paper, we {{describe}} a Heat Pump driven by a gas engine that uses <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> as the cold source producing domestic hot water and heat for the hydronic system. <b>Grey</b> <b>waters</b> are coming exclusively from kitchen’s and bathrooms’ wastewater and their average temperature is about 30 °C. This temperature is constant all along the year. The recovered lukewarm water is stored at atmospheric pressure in a tank. The domestic hot water and the heating water are produced instantaneously by the heat pump and stored in a tank, and hot water is delivered at 58 °C. The paper presents the architecture resulting from a heat integration and exergy analysis study. It allows the heat recovery from the <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> for the generation of domestic hot water while heat recovery from the engine is used for heating the building. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the ratio between the heat recovered from the <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> and the heat recovered from the engine when the thermal efficiency of the engine varies. Simulations show also {{how to handle the}} engine operation during the heating period and in summer conditions for the climatic conditions of France. The seasonal energy efficiency of the system is calculated based on simulations; they predict a seasonal energy efficiency of 2. 1 for generating hot water at 58 °C...|$|R

2500|$|The earlier block {{books were}} printed {{on only one}} side of the paper (anopistographic), using a brown or <b>grey,</b> <b>water</b> based ink. [...] It is {{believed}} they were printed by rubbing pressure, rather than a printing press. The nature of the ink and/or the printing process did not permit printing {{on both sides of the}} paper - damage would result from rubbing the surface of the first side to be printed in order to print the second. [...] When bound together, the one sided sheets produced two pages of images and text, followed by two blank pages. The blank pages were ordinarily pasted together, so as to produce a book without blanks - the Chinese had reached the same solution to the problem. [...] In the 1470s, an oil based ink was introduced permitting printing on both sides of the paper (opistographic) using a regular printing press.|$|E

60|$|And when I {{turned again}} to my companions, with I know not what old folly in my eyes, I know not what unanswerable cry in my heart, Reverie alone {{was at my}} side.

60|$|That {{woman had}} taken them, used their light and colour, and then flung them back! She wrapped them {{again in the}} paper, tied the string, and went towards the river.

60|$|The words, or {{the tone}} {{in which he}} spoke, curiously {{transformed}} the picture. It was as if I now beheld it, anew, through his vision: the <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> stretching eastward to melt into the grey sky, the massed, black trees on the hillside, powdered with white, the snow in rounded, fantastic patches on the huge boulders {{at the foot of}} the cliff. Krebs did not seem like a stranger, but like one whom I had known always,--one who stood in a peculiar relationship between me and something greater I could not define.

60|$|I took a {{fork and}} {{scattered}} the manure along the hollows, and thus we worked, with a wide field between us, yet very near {{in the sense of}} intimacy. I watched him through the wheeling peewits, as the low clouds went stealthily overhead. Beneath us, the spires of the poplars in the spinney were warm gold, as if the blood shone through. Further gleamed the <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> and below it the red roofs. Nethermere was half hidden and far away. There was nothing in this grey, lonely world but the peewits swinging and crying, and George swinging silently at his work. The movement of active life held all my attention, and when I looked up, it was to see the motion of his limbs and his head, {{the rise and fall of}} his rhythmic body, and the rise and fall of the slow waving peewits. After a while, when the cart was empty, he took {{a fork and}} came towards me, working at my task.|$|E
6000|$|At last, as Macnab said, [...] "She went!" [...] but {{who shall}} {{describe}} how she went? It {{seemed as if}} the mighty cake had been suddenly struck from below and shattered. Then the turmoil that ensued was grand and terrible beyond conception. It was but an insignificant portion of God's waters at which we gazed, but how overwhelming it seemed to us! Mass rose upon mass of ice, the cold <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> bursting through and over all, hurling morsels as large as the side of a house violently on each other, till a mighty pile was raised which next moment fell with a crash into the boiling foam. Then, in one direction there was a rush which seemed about to carry all before it, but instead of being piled upwards, some of the masses were driven below, were thrust deep into the mud, and a jam took place. In a few minutes the ice burst upwards again, and the masses were swept on to join the battalions that were already on their way towards the distant lake amid noise and crash and devastation. It seemed as if ice and snow and water had combined to revive the picture if not the reality of ancient chaos! ...|$|E
60|$|These thin <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> swarmed with fish, but all, it seemed, nearly blind, with {{scarcely}} visible eyes {{above their}} snouts. Some {{of the bigger}} fish, with clapping jaws, cast themselves in range or hunger against the rafts. And the Mulgars, seeing their teeth, took good heed to couch themselves close {{in the midst of}} their rafts. The longer they stayed, the thicker grew the concourse of fish drawn together by the noise and smell of the travellers, until the cavern echoed with their restless fins and a kind of supping whisper, as if the fish had speech. So the Mulgars pushed off again, laying about them with their poles to scare the bolder monsters off as they gilded softly into the sluggish current, until the channel narrowed again, and their speed freshened.|$|R

60|$|How impatiently I came home! Thoughts of England I had not {{dared to}} think for three long years might now do what they would in me. I dreamt of the Surrey Hills and the great woods of Burnmore Park, of the {{changing}} skies and stirring soft winds of our grey green Motherland. There was fog in the Irish Sea, and we lost {{the better part of}} a day hooting our way towards Liverpool while I fretted about the ship with all my luggage packed, staring at the <b>grey</b> <b>waters</b> that weltered under the mist. It was the longest day in my life. My heart was full of desire, my eyes ached for the little fields and golden October skies of England, England that was waiting to welcome me back from my exile with such open arms. I was coming home,--home.|$|R
60|$|All {{this was}} on the ninth of September, a weary day to all of us, though in the evening word came that we were to march early next morning and attack Paris in another quarter, {{crossing}} the river by a bridge of boats which the Duc d'Alencon had let build to that end. After two wakeful nights I was well weary, and early laid me down to sleep, rising at dawn with high hopes. And so through the grey light we marched silently to the place appointed, but bridge there was none; for the King, having heard of the Maid's intent, had caused men to work all night long, destroying that which the gentle Duke had builded. Had the King but heard the shouts and curses of our company when they found nought but the bare piles standing, the <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> flowing, and the boats and planks vanished, he might have taken shame to himself of his lack of faith. Therefore I say it boldly, {{it was because of}} men's unbelief that the Maid at Paris wrought no great works, save that she put her body in such hazard of war as never did woman, nay, nor man, since the making of the world.|$|E
60|$|On drawing {{near the}} battling line of {{breakers}} which marked {{the meeting of}} sea and land they could perceive within the nearly invisible horizon an equilateral triangle of lights. It was formed of three stars, a red on the one side, a green on the other, and a white on the summit. This, composed of mast-head and side lamps, {{was all that was}} visible of the Spruce, which now faced end-on about half-a-mile distant, and was still nearing the pier. The girls went further, and stood on the foreshore, listening to the din. Seaward appeared nothing distinct save a black horizontal band embodying itself out of the <b>grey</b> <b>water,</b> strengthening its blackness, and enlarging till it looked like a nearing wall. It was the concave face of a coming wave. On its summit a white edging arose with the aspect of a lace frill; it broadened, and fell over the front with a terrible concussion. Then all before them was a sheet of whiteness, which spread with amazing rapidity, till they found themselves standing in the midst of it, as in a field of snow. Both felt an insidious chill encircling their ankles, and they rapidly ran up the beach.|$|E
60|$|During {{the four}} {{following}} days they were buffeted by a furious wind, but the temperature had risen, {{and the snow}} was melting fast, and splashing knee-deep through slush and water they made progress. While he stumbled along with the pack-straps galling his shoulders, Wyllard was conscious of little beyond the unceasing pain in his joints and the leaden heaviness of his limbs; but the recollection of that march haunted him like a horrible nightmare long afterwards, when each sensation and incident emerged from the haze of numbing misery. He remembered that he stormed at and almost fought with Charly, who lagged behind now {{and then in a}} fit of languid dejection, and that once he fell heavily, and was sensible of a certain half-conscious regret that he was still capable of going on when the Indian dragged him to his feet again. They rarely spoke to one another, and noticed nothing beyond the strip of white waste, through which uncovered brown patches commenced to break, immediately in front of them, except when they crossed some low elevation and looked down upon the stretch of dull <b>grey</b> <b>water</b> not far away on one hand. The breeze, at least, had swept the ice away, and that was reassuring, because it meant that Dampier would be at the inlet when they reached it, though now and then a horrible fear that their strength would fail them or their provisions run out first crept in.|$|E
