2500|$|The [...] "Duck Hook" [...] C-123Bs were {{updated with}} RDR-10 weather radar and ARN-131 <b>homing</b> <b>receiver</b> in 1966 {{in order to}} perform {{missions}} over the Ho Chi Minh trail. All C-123Bs were converted to C-123Ks in 1968, with two wing-mounted turbjets, plus an ECM upgrade with APR-25 radar warning receiver and ALE-1 chaff dispenser. Project [...] "Duck Hook" [...] designation was ultimately changed to [...] "Heavy Hook". The Det. 12 of 1131 Special Activities Squadron unit at Nha Trang received an outstanding unit award from the USAF, for flying 4,000 classified combat and combat support missions from June 1966 to May 1968.|$|E
5000|$|... (NATO {{reporting}} name 'Hormone-C') Search {{and rescue}} and transport version with no weapons bay, radome as Ka-25BSh. Normal equipment included seats for 12, rescue winch, provision for stretchers and auxiliary tanks. Optional equipment included a <b>homing</b> <b>receiver,</b> Electronic Surveillance Measures, searchlight and loudspeaker. Ka-25PS helicopters were usually painted red and white.|$|E
50|$|Western Electric {{developed}} the AN/ARR-2, an all-in-one <b>homing</b> <b>receiver</b> that replaced the broadcast band receiver and external homing adapter and had other enhancements as well. The R-4A/ARR-2 {{uses the same}} dynamotor as the AN/ARC-5 sets, fits in the same racks, and can be controlled by special AN/ARC-5 control boxes. The AN/ARR-2 replaced the earlier R-24/ARC-5 and R-1/ARR-1 combo in AN/ARC-5 installations.|$|E
50|$|The F-4E, {{the most}} {{advanced}} Phantom variant with extensive ground-attack capabilities and an internal gun, {{became the basis for}} the F-4G Wild Weasel V (also known as the Advanced Wild Weasel). This modification consisted of removing the gun and replacing it with the APR-38(t) Radar <b>Homing</b> and Warning <b>Receiver</b> (later upgraded to the APR-47), and a cockpit upgrade for the back seat to manage the electronic combat environment. A total of 134 F-4G models were converted from F-4Es with the first one flying in 1975. Squadron service began in 1978.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of these}} characteristics, AN/ARC-5 close {{equivalents}} {{to the control}} boxes of the ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N are rare or never existed. The most common AN/ARC-5 receiver remote control box is the C-38/ARC-5, which allows control only of audio volume of the VHF and MF/HF receivers. No power, mode, or frequency controls are present. The C-38 also has controls for the R-4A <b>homing</b> <b>receiver.</b> A common AN/ARC-5 transmitter control box C-30A/ARC-5 has controls for selecting the MF/HF transmitter or the VHF transmitter, and a switch to select the channel for both the VHF transmitter and receiver. Mode controls are normally set for voice and covered.|$|E
50|$|AN/ARC-5 set {{composition}} and control differed markedly {{from the earlier}} systems. Three-unit receiver racks were still predominant, but the receiver line-up was quite different. One receiver would usually be a R-4A <b>homing</b> <b>receiver,</b> another the VHF R-28, and the last an MF/HF communication receiver. The transmitter rack would hold a VHF T-23 and an MF/HF transmitter corresponding to the MF/HF receiver. Frequency-stabilized versions of the AN/ARC-5 communications receivers usually have a yellow circle-S stamped on the front panel. Such receivers were not remotely tuned by the pilot, but were instead lock-tuned to the associated transmitter's frequency before take-off. AN/ARC-5 navigation receivers are not so stabilized, and if installed in the rack a control that allows remote tuning is required.|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, ATK {{delivered}} the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. The AGM-88E program is on schedule and on budget, with Full Operational Capability (FOC) planned for September 2014. The AGM-88E {{was designed to}} improve the effectiveness of legacy HARM variants against fixed and relocatable radar and communications sites, particularly those that would shut down to throw off anti-radiation missiles, by attaching a new seeker to the existing Mach 2-capable rocket motor and warhead section, adding a passive anti-radiation <b>homing</b> <b>receiver,</b> satellite and inertial navigation system, a millimeter wave radar for terminal guidance, {{and the ability to}} beam up images of the target via a satellite link just seconds before impact.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere are Various torpedo {{transmission}} waveform. Classical {{theory of}} detection and parametric estimation indicates: the optimum <b>homing</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is related to}} not only sea channel but also the homing transmission waveform. Based {{on the relationship between}} the torpedo transmission waveform and ODN the paper illuminates that the transmission waveform have a great impact on the anti-reverberation effect of ODN, and the narrower pulse spectrum, the better anti-reverberation effect. At last the paper verifies the conclusion by analysing and comparing the rectanglar envelope pulse, trapezoidal envelope pulse and cosine envelope pulse...|$|E
