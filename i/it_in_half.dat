5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E

5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from Chernobyl, and that the creature was created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and fold <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> to the right. Fold <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the legs}} are equal, so are their squares. So {{in order for}} the Pythagorean theorem to work for this special right triangle, the square of the {{hypotenuse}} has to be an even number (and if we cut <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> once then we have the area of the square of the leg).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{facing the}} Palast Hotel across the {{entrance}} to Leipziger Platz (the Potsdam Gate), was the 400-room Hotel Fürstenhof, by Richard Bielenberg (1871–1929) and Josef Moser (1872–1963), erected in 1906/07, also {{on the site of}} an earlier building. With its 200-metre-long main facade along Stresemannstraße, the Fürstenhof was less opulent than some of the other hotels mentioned, despite its size, but was still popular with business people. The new U-Bahn station was being built {{at the same time as}} the hotel and actually ran through the hotel's basement, cutting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> thus making the construction of both into something of a technical challenge, but unlike the Wertheim department store (and contrary to several sources), the hotel did not enjoy a separate entrance directly from the station.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternate}} timeline {{referred to as}} Flashpoint, Artemis is the personal bodyguard for Hippolyta's sister Penthesileia. Penthesileia is upset by the upcoming wedding between Wonder Woman and Aquaman. She conspires with Aquaman's brother Ocean Master to stop it from happening. Penthesileia orders Artemis to disguise herself in Garth's armor in order to murder Wonder Woman on the wedding day. Hippolyta however stops the assassination from happening by blocking the attack. This ultimately kills Hippolyta in the process. Artemis is caught by Garth wearing his armor. She quickly defeats him and uses his unconscious body to frame him for the murder. Aquaman and the Atlanteans then visit Themyscira to negotiate for peace, while Artemis has bombs dropped on Themyscira. Later, Artemis joins the Amazons in conquering the United Kingdom, renaming it New Themyscira. During this same period, Artemis attempts to kill the resistance movement member Lois Lane. Although, Lois is rescued by Resistance member Britannia using the smoke grenades to escape, Britannia is seriously wounded by Artemis. Later, when Artemis and the Furies battle the Resistance, Artemis follows Lois and Britannia in Westminster's lair. She hits Britannia {{in the back with}} an arrow. When Lois prevents her attack, Artemis grabs her and attempts to kill her, but Britannia is able to reach her armour and kills Artemis by flying through her body, tearing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and saving Lois.|$|E

25|$|Ron {{is given}} his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, {{which is made}} out of ash and has a unicorn hair {{sticking}} out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> at the start of Chamber of Secrets, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He also shows signs of exceptional tactical ability, as evidenced by his skill at Wizard's Chess (which is played exactly like normal chess but with living pieces). Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in Order of the Phoenix, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in Half-Blood Prince he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In Deathly Hallows, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.|$|E
25|$|Back in the Enchanted Forest, the {{characters}} attempt {{to work together}} to restore their realm. Regina struggles {{to come to terms with}} the loss of Henry, removing her heart and producing a sleeping curse for herself; though Mary Margaret and Robin Hood persuade her to move forward. Hood and Regina strike a strong friendship, unaware that they are each other's true love. She later takes back her castle, finding Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader) inside, who reveals to Regina that she is her older half-sister as she is the daughter of Cora. She explains her back story of how Cora abandoned her, sending her to Oz, and how she seeks to take everything that she never had away from Regina. Neal and Belle travel to Rumplestiltskin's castle and are located to the Dark One's Vault by a candle-man named Lumiere. Neal unlocks the vault, resurrecting Rumplestiltskin but killing himself. Before he dies, Rumplestiltskin takes his body and merges it with his own. Hook departs the group to return to his pirate life, but struggles with the loss of the Jolly Roger. He is later informed by Ariel that the ship was stolen by fellow pirate Blackbeard (Charles Mesure). Following a duel, Hook seemingly kills Blackbeard and reclaims the Jolly Roger, while Ariel later discovers that her missing love Prince Eric had been kidnapped and taken to Hangman's Island. She later manages to find him and the two live happily together. In the Enchanted Forest, Zelena gets closer to Snow's unborn baby and informs her that she will get it. Eager to find a way stop Zelena, Snow and David seek help from Glinda the Good Witch, who informs them that light magic can defeat Zelena. Understanding this to be a reference to Emma, David sacrifices his heart to Snow, who reluctantly crushes it to create a new curse. Zelena appears and adds a memory spell to the curse that removes everyone's memories of the past year in the Enchanted Forest. Shortly afterwards, Snow instructs Regina to take her heart, split <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and give half to Snow and half to David, and David awakens before the curse is fully enacted. Unbeknownst to Zelena, who gives Rumplestiltskin a memory potion to keep his memories intact, Neal temporarily removes himself from his father's body and sends the potion to Hook so that he can bring Emma back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|Specimen AMNH NJ-90Z {{is a small}} {{wedge-shaped}} {{fragment of}} pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study, splitting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> Though the researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on the sample, this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of {{some parts of the}} specimen for structural and molecular study. [...] Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs and sputter coated with a gold/palladium alloy. [...] The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained, and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen. [...] Another sample of the specimen was mounted in spurr's resin (an embedding medium used in electron microscopy) and sectioned with a diamond knife; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). [...] The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis. [...] A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing. [...] A small sample of the fossil was extracted at the AMNH and sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for DNA amplification. [...] None of the three selected extracts showed any results after the amplification was attempted. [...] It is possible that the fractures and flowlines which split AMNH NJ-90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom.|$|E
