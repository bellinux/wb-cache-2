This study {{is an attempt to}} search into macroeconomic factors that are correlated with ASE <b>index</b> <b>track.</b> The major conclusions of the study imply that, macroeconomic variables do collectively own a high degree of positive and significant correlation with ASE index. But, by employing single regression, we found that inflation rate and rediscount rate are positively correlated with the index, while money supply.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the work {{undertaken}} at the Queensland University of Technology to develop an integrated computer based tool for the prediction of track behaviour under changing traffic conditions. The track degradation model described here {{takes into account the}} degradation effects due to the interactions between track components. The model uses mechanistic relationships and embraces all the major factors which may influence service life of track components. The model was applied to a typical Australian railway track and the results are summarised here. The results showed that increasing axle load and train speed accelerates track degradation in general and rail wear in particular. Sub-grade stiffness and ballast depth are found {{to be the most important}} parameters for track roughness. Timber sleeper failure is sensitive to both traffic parameters and environmental factors, such as the decay index and track drainage condition. Increases in axle loads may not lead to higher sleeper damage failure rate at fixed traffic loads. Decay <b>index,</b> <b>track</b> drainage condition and average age of sleepers, all have a noticeable effect on sleeper failure...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, we present the first Mixed Integer Quadratic Program- ming (MIQP) {{formulation}} for the constrained <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem with the UCITS rules compliance. This allows us to obtain exact solutions for small- and medium-size problems based on real-world datasets. Second, we compare these solutions with the ones provided by the state-of-art heuristic Differential Evolution and Combinatorial Search for <b>Index</b> <b>Tracking</b> (DECS-IT), obtaining information about the heuristic performance and its reliability for the solution of large-size problems that cannot be solved with the exact approach. Empirical results show that DECS-IT is indeed appropriate to tackle the <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem in such cases. Furthermore, we propose a method that combines the good characteristics of the exact and of the heuristic approaches...|$|R

40|$|In the {{practical}} business environment, portfolio managers often face business-driven requirements that {{limit the number}} of constituents in their tracking portfolio. A natural <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> model is thus to minimize a tracking error measure while enforcing an upper bound on the number of assets in the portfolio. In this paper we consider such a cardinality-constrained <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> model. In particular, we propose an efficient nonmonotone projected gradient (NPG) method for solving this problem. At each iteration, this method usually solves several projected gradient subproblems. We show that each subproblem has a closed-form solution, which can be computed in linear time. Under some suitable assumptions, we establish that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the NPG method is a local minimizer of the cardinality-constrained <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. We also conduct empirical tests to compare our method with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm and the hybrid half thresholding algorithm L 1 / 2 for <b>index</b> <b>tracking.</b> The computational results demonstrate that our approach generally produces sparse portfolios with smaller out-of-sample tracking error and higher consistency between in-sample and out-of-sample tracking errors. Moreover, our method outperforms the other two approaches in terms of speed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the threshold accepting heuristic for the <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. The <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem consists in minimizing the tracking error between a portfolio and a benchmark. The objective is to replicate the performance of a given index upon the condition that the number of stocks allowed in the portfolio is smaller than the number of stocks in the benchmark index. Transaction costs are incurred each time that the portfolio is rebalanced. We find the composition of a portfolio that tracks {{the performance of the}} benchmark during a given period in the past and compare it with the performance of the portfolio in a subsequent period. We report computational results in the cases where the benchmarks are market <b>indices</b> <b>tracked</b> by a small number of assets. We find that the threshold accepting heuristic is an e#cient optimization technique for this problem.

40|$|The <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> {{problem is}} the problem of {{determining}} a portfolio of assets whose performance replicates, as closely as possible, that of a financial market index chosen as benchmark. In the enhanced <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem the portfolio is expected to outperform the benchmark with minimal additional risk. In this paper, we study the bi-objective enhanced <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem where two competing objectives, i. e., the expected excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark and the tracking error, are taken into consideration. A bi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem is proposed. Computational results on a set of benchmark instances are given, along with a detailed out-of-sample analysis of the performance of the optimal portfolios selected by the proposed model. Then, a heuristic procedure is designed to build an approximation of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. We test the proposed procedure on a reference set of Pareto optimal solutions. Computational results show that the procedure is significantly faster than the exact computation and provides an extremely accurate approximation...|$|R

The tracking portfolio should be cheap to maintain and update, i. e., invest in a smaller number of constituents than the index, have low turnover and low transaction costs, and should avoid large positions in few assets, as required by the European Union Directive UCITS (Under-taking for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) rules.

40|$|Abstract. Fundamental {{properties}} of conditional value-at-risk, {{as a measure}} of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk, are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in applications because of the prevalence of models based on scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several case studies, are illustrated further with an example of <b>index</b> <b>tracking.</b> Key Words: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios, hedging, <b>index</b> <b>tracking,</b> portfolio optimization, risk managemen...|$|R
