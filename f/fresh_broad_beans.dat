40|$|Abstract. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds, {{with a high}} {{nutritional}} value at green maturity stage, are used for direct human consumption and in food processing. However <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> green seeds had as a very shortly time to use because the green seeds very quickly lost the white-green fresh colour. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the content of biologically active substances in <b>fresh</b> <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds immediately after the harvest and seeds from pods stored for a week under low temperature conditions. Experimental material consisted of <b>fresh,</b> green <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds of Bachus, Basta, R- 366 / 1, Bolero, Jankiel Biaáy, and Windsor Biaáy cultivars. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds were sown in the second decade of April at 60 × 10 cm spacing, 100 seeds per plot of 6. 0 m 2 area. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> pods were harvested once at the stage of technological maturity of seeds in the second and third decade of July. Marketable seed samples of 500 g were collected for laboratory tests. At the same time, immediately after the harvest, samples of 2 kg marketable <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> pods of each culti-var were collected and storage within 7 days at 1 – 4 °C. The contents of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll (a + b), flavonoids (QE), free phenolic acids sum (CAE), and dry matter were determined in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds directly after the harvest as well as in the seeds from the pods stored for 7 days. In the results of the investigation indicate that green faba bean seeds from the storage pods had a good white-green colour and marketable quality, how-ever the seeds had the significantly lowest content of L-ascorbic acid and chlorophyll (a + b). The content of selected biologically active substances in the seeds after storage in the pods indicates a significant difference in dependence on cultivar...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba L. [unranked] major (Harz) Beck) {{is usually}} {{consumed}} dry. In Chile, however, <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> is grown as a vegetable crop with indeterminate genotypes. The new 'Alarga', 'Retaca' and 'Verde Bonita' <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> genotypes, {{which have a}} determinate growth habit, were evaluated in six irrigated environments in central Chile at three locations (Rancagua, Talca, and Talagante) and on two planting dates (F 1 and F 2; 1 -mo apart). The aim was to characterize their yield and select the best-yielding genotypes in terms of pod yield (PY) and fresh grain yield (GY). The best location(s) to produce fresh pods and fresh grain were also identified and described. Fresh grain yield and components were measured and the genotype x environment interaction (GxE) was analyzed. Pod yield differed among genotypes; 'Verde Bonita' and 'Retaca' had the highest PY (15 500 kg ha- 1, 8 % higher than 'Alarga'). There was a GxE interaction for GY and 'Retaca' had its highest yield in Talca on the two planting dates and in Rancagua when planted late (F 2). Mean GY of 'Retaca' was 3900 kg ha- 1 with {{the highest number of}} grains per 1 m² (NG). The best GY was related to a higher seasonal photothermal quotient (ranging from 1. 15 to 1. 82 MJ m- 2 d- 1 °C- 1, r = 0. 90, P d" 0. 001). The lowest GY was in Talagante on F 1. Genotypes differed in yield composition; 'Retaca' had many small pods giving many seeds per unit area and 'Verde Bonita' had large pods yielding fewer grains per unit area. The 'Retaca' genotype is preferred by the frozen <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> industry, whereas 'Verde Bonita' is preferred by the <b>fresh</b> <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> market...|$|R

The role of aphid infestation level and duration, systemic production of volatiles by "insect-free" parts of the plant, and the specificity of aphid-induced volatiles on the flight behavior of the foraging female parasitoids were investigated. The upper insect-free part of a three-leaved <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plant, which was basally infested by a population of 40 A. pisum, released synomones detectable by A. ervi females after at least 48 - 72 hr of infestation, resulting in both significant increases iii oriented flights and landings on the source compared with uninfested control plants.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-host {{resistance}} (NHR) confers {{plant species}} immunity against {{the majority of}} microbial pathogens and represents the most robust and durable form of plant resistance in nature. As {{one of the main}} genera of rust fungi with economic and biological importance, Puccinia infects almost all cereals but is unable to cause diseases on legumes. Little is known about the mechanism of this kind of effective defense in legumes to these non-host pathogens. Results In this study, the basis of NHR in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba L.) against the wheat stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), was characterized. No visible symptoms were observed on <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> leaves inoculated with Pst. Microscopic observations showed that successful location of stomata and haustoria formation were significantly reduced in Pst infection of <b>broad</b> <b>bean.</b> Attempted infection induced the formation of papillae, cell wall thickening, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and accumulation of phenolic compounds in plant cell walls. The few Pst haustoria that did form in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> cells were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and those cells elicited cell death. Furthermore, a total of seven defense-related genes were identified and found to be up-regulated during the Pst infection. Conclusions The results indicate that NHR in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> against Pst results from a continuum of layered defenses, including basic incompatibility, structural and chemical strengthening of cell wall, posthaustorial hypersensitive response and induction of several defense-related genes, demonstrating the multi-layered feature of NHR. This work also provides useful information for further determination of resistance mechanisms in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> to rust fungi, especially the adapted important <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> rust pathogen, Uromyces viciae-fabae, because of strong similarity and association between NHR of plants to unadapted pathogens and basal resistance of plants to adapted pathogens. </p...|$|R
