40|$|The initial {{reports in}} this issue of two new studies of {{childhood}} brain cancer and 60 -Hz magnetic fields (1, 2) illustrate a few general observations on evolving research in this area. Epidemiologic assessment of magnetic field exposures is still primitive. Magnetic field exposures come from many different sources. We should not be proud that we still study them one by one. Appliance-specific relative risks (one for blow dryers, one for curling irons, etc.) are the most glaring example. Time-activity data and magnetic flux density measurements are needed to quantify <b>exposures</b> from individual <b>appliances.</b> At a minimum, this information could be used to stabilize ensembles of appliance-specific relative risk estimates (3 - 6). Ideally, <b>appliance</b> <b>exposures</b> would be consolidated and combined with measures of exposure from power lines and other sources. Developing a program of combined-source magnetic field exposure assessment tailored for use in epidemiologic studies would be a challenging, but technically feasible, task. No methodological need is greater in this area of research. Responding to a private exhortation to work toward a multiappliance exposure measure, an epidemiologist once expressed to me a reluctance to "combine apples and oranges. " The simile was ironic. Combining fruits is exactly what is done in the more mature field of nutritional epidemiology to measure consumption of fructose and other nutrients...|$|R

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to electric and magnetic fields has been amply investigated in the extremely-low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency (RF) ranges. However, research on typical {{emissions in the}} intermediate-frequency (IF) range remains limited. In this study, an extensive measurement survey {{was performed on the}} levels of electric and magnetic fields at intermediate frequencies typically emitted by a wide range of household appliances. The emissions contained either harmonic signals, with fundamental frequencies between 6 kHz and 100 kHz, or much more capricious spectra, dominated by 50 Hz harmonics emanating far in the IF domain. Use of appliances at close distance (20 cm) of certain appliances may result in a relatively high <b>exposure,</b> but no <b>appliance's</b> IF emissions exceeded the ICNIRP 2010 exposure summation rule (maximum electric-and magnetic-field exposure quotients were respectively 1. 00, for a compact fluorescent lamp, and 0. 13, for an induction cooker) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} Euclea natalensis gel on the reduction of erosive wear with or without abrasion, in enamel and dentin. During two five-day experimental crossover phases, volunteers (n = 10) wore palatal devices containing human enamel and dentin blocks (E = 8 and D = 8). The gel was applied in a thin layer {{in the experimental group}}, and was not applied in the control group. In the intraoral phase, volunteers used the palatal appliance for 12 h before the gel treatment, and were instructed to start the erosive challenges 6 h after the gel application. Erosion was performed with Coca-Cola® (for 5 min) 4 times/day. The appliance was then put back into the mouth and was brushed after 30 minutes. After intraoral <b>exposure,</b> the <b>appliances</b> were removed and the specimens were analyzed using profilometry (mean ± SD, &# 956;m). The Euclea natalensis gel caused less wear in enamel in the experimental group (EROS = 12. 86 ± 1. 75 µm; EROS + ABRAS = 12. 13 ± 2. 12 µm) than in the control group (EROS = 14. 12 ± 7. 66 µm; EROS + ABRAS = 16. 29 ± 10. 72 µm); however, the groups did not differ from each other significantly. A statistically significant value was found for erosion and eros + abrasion in dentin (p = 0. 001). Euclea natalensis {{may play a role in}} the prevention of dentin loss under mild erosive and abrasive conditions. A clinical trial is required to confirm these promising results in a clinical situation...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{assessment}} of human exposure to electric and magnetic fields {{has focused on}} the extremely-low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency (RF) ranges. However, research on the typically emitted fields in the intermediate-frequency (IF) range (300 Hz to 1 MHz) as well as potential effects of IF fields on the human body remains limited, although the range of household appliances with electrical components working in the IF range has grown significantly (e. g., induction cookers and compact fluorescent lighting). In this study, an extensive measurement survey was performed on the levels of electric and magnetic fields in the IF range typically present in residences as well as emitted by a wide range of household appliances under real-life circumstances. Using spot measurements, residential IF field levels were found to be generally low, while the use of certain appliances at close distance (20 cm) may result in a relatively high <b>exposure.</b> Overall, <b>appliance</b> emissions contained either harmonic signals, with fundamental frequencies between 6 kHz and 300 kHz, which were sometimes accompanied by regions in the IF spectrum of rather noisy, elevated field strengths, or much more capricious spectra, dominated by 50 Hz harmonics emanating far in the IF domain. The maximum peak field strengths recorded at 20 cm were 41. 5 V/m and 2. 7 A/m, both from induction cookers. Finally, none of the appliance emissions in the IF range exceeded the exposure summation rules recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 62233) standard at 20 cm and beyond (maximum exposure quotients EQ(E) 1. 0 and (E) Q(H) 0. 13) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Use of {{wireless}} devices have been increasing {{during the last}} three decades in the world. Health risks caused by <b>exposure</b> to these <b>appliances</b> has become a public concern. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of exposure to Wi-Fi on DNA breaks and oxidative stress parameters. Methods: 16 male mice divided in 2 groups; experimental (exposed) (n= 8) and the control groups (n= 8). While the control group was kept not exposed to the signals the experimental group was exposed to 2. 45 GHz Wi-Fi signal GHz, for 8 h/ 21 day; Single strand DNA breaks in lymphocytes were determined by using the Alkaline Comet Assay (before and after the exposure period). Oxidative stress parameters, including, catalase activity, PON 1 activity, and TAC were measured (before and after the exposure period). Results: In the exposed group, it was observed an increase in single-stranded DNA break; decrease in PON 1 enzyme activity also increase the catalase activity compared to before exposure to wi-fi,  but TAC was not significantly different. While in the control group, none of the indicators measured at the end of the study there was no significant difference compared to 21 days ago. Conclusion: The findings of the present study show that Wi-Fi exposure can increase oxidative stress and the strand DNA break...|$|R

Electromagnetic radiation with wavelength {{in the range}} 100 nm to 1 mm is known as optical radiation and includes ultraviolet radiation, the visible spectrum, and infrared radiation. The deleterious short- and long-term biological effects of ultraviolet radiation, including melanoma and other skin cancers, are well recognized. Infrared radiation may also have damaging biological effects. Methods. The objective of this review {{was to assess the}} literature over the last 15 years and to summarize correlations between exposure to optical radiation and the risk of melanoma and other cancers. Results. There is a clear correlation between exposure to UV radiation and the development of skin cancer. Most importantly, a strong association between artificial UV radiation exposure, for example, tanning devices, and the risk of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma has been clearly demonstrated. There is no clear evidence that exposure to IR and laser radiation may increase the risk of skin cancer, although negative health effects have been observed. Conclusions. Preventative strategies that involve provision of public information highlighting the risks associated with exposure to sunlight remain important. In addition, precautionary measures that discourage <b>exposure</b> to tanning <b>appliances</b> are required, as is legislation to prevent their use during childhood. 1...|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{stands out}} as {{the main cause of}} contact allergy in both {{children}} and adults, which has given rise to concern and the introduction of regulations by official bodies. Today´s youths are frequently exposed to body piercing and orthodontic treatment. Changes in youth lifestyle practices are also likely to influence nickel exposure and thus, the occurrence of nickel allergy. However, against patient and parental concern regarding nickel <b>exposure</b> to orthodontic <b>appliances,</b> often evoked by allergies following piercing, stand results from studies indicating that early orthodontic appliance treatment may reduce, rather than increase, prevalence of nickel allergy; a finding that has been suggested to result from tolerance induction by early exposure to nickel via the oral route. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate the association between nickel allergy and exposure to different orthodontic appliances and lifestyle, in particular piercing, as well as to study nickel release from orthodontic appliances into the oral cavity. Furthermore, one objective was to establish baseline prevalence data of nickel allergy in a Swedish adolescent population. Data was generated from a cross-sectional survey, in which about 6000 youths completed a questionnaire and almost 4500 of these were patch-tested for contact allergy. Information on <b>exposure</b> to orthodontic <b>appliances</b> was verified by dental records, whilst nickel content in saliva and dental biofilm was measured in a clinical study. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel allergy when orthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 8) and similar results were found for data verified from dental records, however statistical significance was lost when adjusting for background factors (OR 0. 6, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 1. 0). Exposure to full fixed appliances with NiTi-containing alloys, as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing’ appliance group prior to piercing correlated with a significantly reduced risk of nickel allergy and a trend towards a reduced risk with exposure duration. Nickel could also be found in significantly higher concentrations from dental plaque samples, but not saliva samples, in orthodontic patients who were well into treatment compared to patients who had not been exposed to orthodontic appliances. The effect was not found to be due to differences in estimated dietary nickel intake between the two groups. Significantly more girls than boys (13. 3 % versus 2. 5 %) were found to be patch-test positive to nickel. Positive nickel tests were also most prevalent in occupational programmes and least prevalent in natural science programmes, indicating differences in lifestyle and exposure to nickel. Dropout from testing was handled using a missing-value analysis. This internal validation showed that our results overestimated the occurrence of nickel allergy to a minor degree. More girls than boys reported piercing, vegetarian/vegan diet, and smoking practices, whereas an interesting shift in tattooing prevalence was observed with a larger proportion of girls reporting this practice compared to boys. Sex, number of piercings, smoking and orthodontic appliance treatment prior to piercing were found to influence weighted risk estimates of nickel allergy. To conclude, although orthodontic patients are exposed to nickel intraorally, we found no increased risk of sensitising adolescents to nickel by the use of oral orthodontic appliances. On the contrary, early orthodontic treatment preceding piercing reduced the risk of nickel allergy by a factor of 1. 5 - 2. 0. This reduced risk appears to be associated with estimated nickel release of the appliance and duration of treatment, in all supporting a hypothesised induction of immunological tolerance via oral administration of nickel. Our study also showed a strong association between lifestyle and nickel allergy. Although there have been changes in lifestyle over time, as indicated by the strong shift in tattooing practices, no large change in nickel allergy prevalence was found compared with previous Swedish data. Our data will serve as a baseline for future studies of the effect of nickel exposure regulations, such as the Nickel Directive, and for studies of lifestyle changes and their effects on nickel allergy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{that have}} {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} <b>exposure</b> to gas <b>appliances</b> emissions at home with respiratory health in children obtained heterogeneous and limited results. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the association between the use of gas cooking at home during pregnancy and respiratory problems in children during their first year of life. METHODS: In the years 2003 through 2008 pregnant women were enrolled in 4 Spanish areas and visited in different age-points following a common protocol. Outcomes studied (from a questionnaire) were any episode of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), wheezing, persistent cough, chestiness and otitis. The association between exposure to gas cooking at home and respiratory outcomes was assessed using logistic regression and adjusting by confounding variables. Some potential effect modifiers (i. e. smoking, fruit and vegetables consumption) were examined. RESULTS: Among the 2003 children included in the study, a total of 731 (36. 6 %) had a LRTI episode, 693 (34. 6 %) experienced wheezing, 302 (15. 5 %) a persistent cough, 939 (47. 4 %) chestiness and 620 (31. 2 %) had an episode of otitis during their first year of life. Gas cookers were present in 45. 5 % of homes. Exposure to gas cooking in homes was not associated with respiratory outcomes Odds Ratios (OR) were close to 1 and not statistically significant. However, a positive association was found for otitis among infants whose mothers reported low intakes of fruit and vegetables during pregnancy [OR (95 % CI) = 1. 38 (1. 01 - 1. 9) ] and also wheezing and chestiness were associated with gas cookers among those children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: In susceptible subjects (those whose mothers smoke and consumed below average fruit and vegetables) we found an association between exposure to gas cooking during pregnancy and risk of wheezing, chestiness and otitis during the first year of life. But more research is needed regarding not only gas cooking and respiratory health but also the possible effect modifier role of diet and tobacco...|$|R
