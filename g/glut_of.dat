5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them.

Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods.

40|$|AbstractIn adipose cells, insulin induces the {{translocation}} <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 by stimulating their exocytosis from a basal intracellular compartment to {{the plasma}} membrane. Increasing overexpression of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged GLUT 4 in rat adipose cells {{results in a}} roughly proportional increase in cell surface HA-GLUT 4 levels in the basal state, accompanied by a marked reduction of the fold HA-GLUT 4 translocation in response to insulin. Using biochemical methods and cotransfection experiments with differently epitope-tagged GLUT 4, we show that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 {{does not affect the}} intracellular sequestration <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 in the absence of insulin, but rather reduces the relative insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane. In contrast, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 does not interfere with the targeting <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 and vice versa. These results suggest that the mechanism involved in the intracellular sequestration <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 has a high capacity whereas the mechanism for GLUT 4 translocation is readily saturated by overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4, implicating an active translocation machinery in the exocytosis <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4...|$|R

40|$|Newly {{synthesized}} {{glucose transporter}} 4 (GLUT 4) enters into the insulin-responsive storage compartment {{in a process}} that is Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing Arf-binding protein (GGA) dependent, whereas insulin-stimulated translocation is regulated by Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS 160). In the present study, using a variety <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 /GLUT 1 chimeras, we have analyzed the specific motifs <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 that are important for GGA and AS 160 regulation <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 trafficking. Substitution of the amino terminus and the large intracellular loop <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 into GLUT 1 (chimera 1 - 441) fully recapitulated the basal state retention, insulin-stimulated translocation, and GGA and AS 160 sensitivity <b>of</b> wild-type <b>GLUT</b> 4 (GLUT 4 -WT). GLUT 4 point mutation (GLUT 4 -F 5 A) resulted in loss <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 intracellular retention in the basal state when coexpressed with both wild-type GGA and AS 160. Nevertheless, similar to GLUT 4 -WT, the insulin-stimulated plasma membrane localization <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 -F 5 A was significantly inhibited by coexpression of dominant-interfering GGA. In addition, coexpression with a dominant-interfering AS 160 (AS 160 - 4 P) abolished insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 -WT but not GLUT 4 -F 5 A translocation. GLUT 4 endocytosis and intracellular sequestration also required both the amino terminus and large cytoplasmic loop <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4. Furthermore, both the FQQI and the SLL motifs participate in the initial endocytosis from the plasma membrane; however, once internalized, unlike the FQQI motif, the SLL motif is not responsible for intracellular recycling <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 back to the specialized compartment. Together, we have demonstrated that the FQQI motif within the amino terminus <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 is essential for GLUT 4 endocytosis and AS 160 -dependent intracellular retention but not for the GGA-dependent sorting <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 into the insulin-responsive storage compartment...|$|R

Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> such productions from the major Hollywood studios.

40|$|Objective: In vivo {{differentiation}} of cardiac myocytes {{is associated with}} downregulation of the glucose transporter isoform GLUT 1 and upregulation <b>of</b> the isoform <b>GLUT</b> 4. Adult rat cardiomyocytes in primary culture undergo spontaneous dedifferentiation, followed by spreading and partial redifferentiation, which can be influenced by growth factors. We used this model to study the signaling mechanisms modifying the expression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 in cardiac myocytes. Results: Adult rat cardiomyocytes in primary culture exhibited spontaneous upregulation <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 and downregulation <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4, suggesting resumption of a fetal program <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> gene expression. Treatment with IGF- 1 and, to a minor extent, FGF- 2 resulted in restored expression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 protein and mRNA. Activation of p 38 MAPK mediated the increased expression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 in response to IGF- 1.

40|$|The GLUT 4 glucose {{transporter}} {{appears to be}} targeted to a unique insulin-sensitive intracellular membrane compartment in fat and muscle cells. Insulin stimulates glucose transport in these cell types by mediating the partial redistribution <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 from this intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. The structural basis for the unique targeting behavior <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 was investigated in the insulin-sensitive L 6 myoblast cell line. Analysis of immunogold-labeled cells of independent clonal lines by electron microscopy indicated that 51 - 53 % <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 was present in the plasma membrane in the basal state. Insulin did not significantly affect this distribution. In contrast, only 4. 2 - 6. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 was present in the plasma membrane of basal L 6 cells and insulin increased this percentage by 3. 7 - 6. 1 -fold. Under basal conditions and after insulin treatment, GLUT 4 was detected in tubulovesicular structures, often clustered near Golgi stacks, and in endosome-like vesicles. Analysis of 25 chimeric transporters consisting of reciprocal domains <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 and GLUT 4 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that only the final 25 amino acids of the COOH- terminal cytoplasmic tail <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 were both necessary and sufficient for the targeting pattern observed for GLUT 4.

Contrary to previous studies, the NH 2 terminus <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 did not affect the subcellular distribution of chimeras. Analysis of a chimera containing the COOH-terminal tail <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 by immunogold electron microscopy indicated that its subcellular distribution in basal cells was very similar to that <b>of</b> wild-type <b>GLUT</b> 4 and that its content in the plasma membrane increased 6. 8 - 10. 5 -fold in the presence of insulin.

In the basal state, domains (clusters) <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 molecules in PM are created by an exocytosis that retains GLUT 4 at the fusion site.

In the present study we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on the expression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 and GLUT 4 proteins in differentiated L 6 muscle cells and the signalling mechanism(s) via which dexamethasone may act. Dexamethasone (300 nM) treatment for 24 h elevated GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 proteins by 68 % and 94 %, respectively, above control levels. These increases were due to de novo synthesis as shown by metabolic labelling with [35 S]methionine.
