5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially <b>flatfishes,</b> though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the <b>flatfishes</b> Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E
5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, <b>flatfishes,</b> damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, <b>flatfishes,</b> and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{technique}} in APEC Air shipment of live and fresh fish and seafood guidelines {{is described as}} follows: [...] "A cut is made {{toward the front of}} the <b>flatfish</b> severing the major artery and the spinal cord. Placement of the cut is made to preserve the greatest amount of <b>flatfish</b> flesh. This paralyzes the <b>flatfish.</b> A second cut is made in the tail to hasten the removal of blood. <b>Flatfish</b> are then chilled slowly to maintain circulation and facilitate the bleeding process. After the <b>flatfish</b> have been bled, they are transferred to a salt/ice water slurry and chilled to 12°C." ...|$|R
40|$|Some major {{latitudinal}} {{trends in}} the physiology, population dynamics and ecology of <b>flatfish</b> are illustrated, and related to their ultimate cause: temperature-mediated difference of metabolic rate. The niche of tropical <b>flatfish</b> is then defined with some emphasis on Psettodes erumei in the Gulf of Thailand, and a hypothesis is derived to explain the generally low observed biomass-and hence recruitment of tropical <b>flatfish.</b> It is stated that <b>flatfish</b> are overadapted to feeding on zoobenthic in- and epifauna. In combination with a trend of decreasing importance of the benthic system towards the tropics, this suggests an increasing importance of food-limitation with decreasing latitude {{and as a consequence}} lower biomass values. Furthermore, the general increase of maintenance metabolism with temperature reduces in tropical systems the size of <b>flatfish</b> at which oxygen limits further growth. This aspect is responsible for the general trend of a smaller <b>flatfish</b> size with decreasing latitude. Finally, implications for future <b>flatfish</b> research are discussed...|$|R
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and <b>flatfishes,</b> the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, <b>flatfishes,</b> and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark. It also consumes crustaceans, in particular crabs but also hermit crabs and large shrimp, and cephalopods. Given the opportunity, this shark will scavenge. Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods, and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei. The netted dog whelk (Nassarius reticulatus) preys on the nursehound's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include <b>flatfishes,</b> with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristic}} of <b>flatfish,</b> {{other than their}} flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes {{are on the same}} side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of <b>flatfish,</b> the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed <b>flatfish),</b> and in others, they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed <b>flatfish).</b> Primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.|$|R
25|$|Juvenile geoducks are {{susceptible}} to attack from predators {{in their first year}} when they have not yet burrowed deeply into the substrate. Crabs, sea stars, predatory gastropods, and <b>flatfishes</b> have been observed to feed on them. Adult geoducks, which are already buried deep in the substrate, are out of reach of most predators except for sea otters and humans.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fish that}} exhibit biofluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and <b>flatfishes,</b> also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes {{function}} as long-pass filters, thus enabling {{the species that}} possess them to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fishes that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing biofluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it or a similar functional role. Biofluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage, and {{that many of these}} lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.|$|E
500|$|The banded houndshark is nocturnal and {{generally}} solitary, though several individuals may rest together, sometimes piled atop one another inside a cave. It feeds mainly on crustaceans (including shrimps, crabs, hermit crabs, and mantis shrimps), cephalopods (including octopus), and spoon worms; polychaete worms, tunicates, peanut worms, and small, bottom-living bony fishes (including <b>flatfishes,</b> conger eels, herring, jacks, drums, and grunts) are occasionally consumed. Shrimp and spoon worms are important prey for sharks up to [...] long; cephalopods predominate in the diets of larger sharks.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years German food control {{laboratories}} have established proof of {{a significant number of}} cases of incorrectly labelled <b>flatfish</b> on the German market. A <b>flatfish</b> offered as sole (Solea vulgaris) in Southern Germany served as an example for mislabelled <b>flatfish</b> and for the difficulties food control laboratories may encounter and to identify products of unknown origin. Morphometric and meristic examination, as well as isoelectric focusing of sarcoplasmic proteins, PCR-based DNA-analysis failed to identify the fish. By using these methods, it only could be excluded that the fish belonged to the species of Solea vulgaris or another described <b>flatfish</b> species. DNA sequencing of an amplicon gave a sequence identical to a sequence in GenBank, which, however, turned out to be incorrectly assigned to Solea vulgaris. More research about characterization and identification of tropical <b>flatfish</b> is recommended, because of the growing importance of these fishes for the European market...|$|R
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (<b>flatfish)</b> are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern <b>flatfish</b> is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed <b>flatfish)</b> and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed <b>flatfish).</b> The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|R
500|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray feeds mainly on bony fishes, including anchovies, herring, hake, mackerel, croakers, rockfishes, surfperches, kelp bass, and <b>flatfishes,</b> {{but will also}} take cephalopods and invertebrates given the opportunity. Its jaws are highly distensible, allowing it to swallow surprisingly large prey: one female [...] long has been observed ingesting a silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) nearly half her length. During the day, the Pacific {{electric ray}} is an ambush predator: when a fish approaches its head, the ray [...] "jumps" [...] forward from its resting place and folds down its disc to envelop it, while delivering strong shocks. Once the fish is subdued, the ray repositions itself to swallow it head-first. The entire process takes about two minutes.|$|E
500|$|The bignose shark feeds {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling bony fishes (including lizardfishes, croakers, <b>flatfishes,</b> and batfishes), {{cartilaginous}} fishes (including Squalus dogfishes, Holohalaelurus catsharks, Dasyatis stingrays, and chimaeras), and cephalopods. In turn, juveniles may potentially {{fall prey to}} larger sharks. Like other requiem sharks, this species is viviparous: when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups, with seven being typical, following a gestation period of approximately 10 months. A single litter may be sired by two or more males. Birthing {{has been reported to}} occur in August and September in the Mediterranean, and in September and October off Madagascar. The newborns measure [...] long. Males and females mature sexually at around [...] long, respectively. The average age of reproductively active individuals is 21 years.|$|E
500|$|The diet of the Atlantic torpedo {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fishes, including <b>flatfishes,</b> salmon, eels, and mullet, {{though it has}} also been known to take small catsharks and crustaceans. Captive rays have been observed lying still on the bottom and [...] "pouncing" [...] on fish that pass in front of them. At the moment of contact, the ray traps the prey against its body or the bottom by curling its pectoral fin disc around it, while delivering strong electric shocks. This strategy allows the sluggish ray to capture relatively fast-moving fish. Once subdued, the prey is maneuvered to the mouth with rippling motions of the disc and swallowed whole, head-first. The ray's highly distensible jaws allow surprisingly large prey to be ingested: an intact salmon weighing [...] has been found in the stomach of one individual, and another contained a summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) [...] long. This ray has been known to kill fish much larger than it can eat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{introduces}} a vision-based automatic system (VAMS) for non-contact measurement of morphometric characteristics of <b>flatfish,</b> such as total length (TL), body width (BW), height (H), and weight (W). The H and W are simply {{measured by a}} laser displacement and a load cell, respectively. The TL and BW are measured by a proposed morphological image processing algorithm. The proposed algorithm cans measurement, when the tail of <b>flatfish</b> is deformed, {{and when it is}} randomly oriented. In the experiment, the average and maximum measurement errors were recorded, and standard deviations and coefficients of variation (CVs) for the measurements were calculated. From those results, when <b>flatfish</b> the TL measurements had an average of 266. 844 mm, a standard deviation of 0. 351 mm, a CV of 0. 131 %, and a maximum error of 0. 87 mm with straightened <b>flatfish</b> (TLA: 267 mm, BWA: 141 mm), and when <b>flatfish</b> of different sizes were measured, the errors in the TL and BW measurements were both about 0. 2 %. Using a single conveyor, the VAMS can process up to 900 fishes per hour. Moreover, it can measure morphometric characteristics of <b>flatfish</b> with a TL of up to 500 mm...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{zones are}} {{essential}} nursery habitats for most juvenile <b>flatfish</b> species.
