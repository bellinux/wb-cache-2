5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and <b>eucaryotes.</b> This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E

40|$|Stromatolites are {{laminated}} organosedimentary structures {{formed by}} microbial communities, principally cyanobacteria although <b>eucaryote</b> phototrophs {{may also be}} involved in the construction of modern stromatolites. In this study, productivity and photophysiology of communities from stromatolites (laminated) and thrombolites (nonlaminated) were analysed using fluorescence imaging. Sub-samples of mats were excised at Highborne Cay, Bahamas, and cross-sectioned to simultaneously analyse surface, near-surface (1 – 2 mm), and deeper (2 – 10 mm) communities. Rapid light curve parameters and nonphotochemical downregulation showed distinct differences between phototroph communities, consistent with the reported quasi-succession of classic stromatolite mat types. Greater productivity was shown by cyanobacteria in Type 1 and Type 3 mats (first and final stage of the succession, Schizothrix gebeleinii and Solentia sp. respectively) and lower productivity within Type 2 mats (intermediate mat type). <b>Eucaryote</b> mat types, dominated by stalked (Striatella sp. and Licmophora sp.) and tube-dwelling (e. g. Nitzschia and Navicula spp.) diatoms, showed greater productivity than cyanobacteria communities, with the exception of Striatella (low productivity) and an unidentified coccoid cyanobacterium (high productivity). Findings indicate comparative variability between photosynthetically active procaryote and <b>eucaryote</b> sub-communities within stromatolites, with a pattern logically following the succession of ‘classic’ mat types, and lower than the productivity of <b>eucaryote</b> dominated ‘nonclassic’ mat types...|$|R

Exposure {{to a range of}} concentrations of thiram, cycloheximide, and neutral red (0. 4 to 210, 36 to 1, 777, 4 to 346 μM, respectively) was 98 to 100 % effective at inhibiting growth of a chrysomonad in culture. Exposure to colchicine and griseofulvin (50 to 1, 000 μM for both) yielded only 24 to 94 and 53 to 79 % inhibition, respectively. Exposures to thiram, neutral red, and griseofulvin were 90 to 100 % effective at inhibiting growth in culture of a ciliate, Cyclidium sp., and the responses to colchicine and cycloheximide were variable (64 to 100 and 0 to 100 % inhibition, respectively). Thiram and neutral red inhibited field populations of nanozooplankton more effectively than cycloheximide and colchicine. Direct effects of <b>eucaryote</b> inhibitors on growing cultures of bacterioplankton varied with parameters measured and duration of exposure. After 3 -day exposures, specific growth rates and “instantaneous” heterotrophic potential ([14 C]glucose uptake) were not consistently affected, but biosynthetic activity (RNA and DNA syntheses) was depressed. The degree of inhibition of isolates and field populations of phytoplankton depended upon type of inhibitor and phytoplankton species. In field experiments, it was possible to calculate rates of bacterioplankton production and grazing mortality for only 16 of 29 inhibitor experiments and for 4 of 10 size fractionation experiments. Bacterioplankton production and mortality estimates varied greatly with the <b>eucaryote</b> inhibitor used, and those derived from inhibition techniques were substantially different from those derived from fractionation techniques. The poor performances of both techniques are attributed to the following: (i) effects of inhibitors on phytoplankton, (ii) indirect effects of the inhibitors on bacterioplankton, and (iii) insufficient separation of grazers from prey by filtration techniques. Because of the inconsistent results obtained in this investigation, we strongly recommend exercising caution in the application of inhibitor techniques to ecological problems, especially in phototrophically dominated systems...|$|R
