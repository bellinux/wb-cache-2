In notion that it is kind of comics that those are several differences in reference of the each of person deixis altough it use the same personal pronoun. The study is qualitative analysis. The data of this study were analyzed by using two steps. First, analyzing the translation work and the reason why the translators did it. Second, writing them down and comparing the source text and the target text. Some of the personal deixis used in the bilingual comics Cinderella is first person deixis, second persond deixis, and third person deixis. Personal deixis used in bilingual comic are those dealing with the references of the <b>deictic</b> <b>word.</b> The deictic words is the personal pronouns. It dealing with the function of the word. It can be subjective case or objective case. It also can be possessive adjective and possessive pronoun. It also can be self pronoun or reflexive pronoun. And also single or plural form.

40|$|Conventional {{symbolic}} gestures like pointing {{appear at}} the end of children's first year. Gesture-word combinations can be observed in their second year as the transition towards two-word speech. But before gestures are combined with words, gaze and vocalizations complement them. These combinations might already carry pragmatic, social and semantic functions. In this paper, we explore the issue of (dis) continuity between gestures and words and pointing/vocalization/gaze combinations with the data taken from two longitudinal follow-ups of French speaking children aged 8 months to three, filmed at home with their parents once a month. Our analyses show that gaze alone, or prosody alone, do not seem to have a discriminating role in differentiating the traditional functions of pointing (proto-imperative versus proto-declarative). Prosody in gesture/vocal combinations seemed to be an earlier, more discriminating feature than gaze in indicating children's positioning to their interlocutor and their use of differentiated social-pragmatic functions. Our results show that no feature alone can help interpret “pointing events” but that fine-grained correlations between pointing gestures, prosody, gaze, nature and position of the target, position of the participants, interpretation of the adult could help distinguish between the different functions of “pointing events”. Our first analyses of the vocal and verbal contents in the data show that pointing gestures are accompanied by vocalizations from the start. Vocal and gestural modalities are therefore associated and complement each other from the very onset of pointing. We extract and categorize all pointing gestures, vocalizations and demonstratives in order to analyze their functions in context. Different “stages” could be drawn. 1) At first, the children vocalize as they point. In order to interpretate the “pointing events”, we need to take various parameters into account (gaze, prosody, nature of the object, position of the adult [...] .) and it is often quite difficult to understand the child's intention. 2) The children then use the demonstrative “ça” (“that”) combined with a pointing gesture at 1; 02 simply to localize the object with the gesture and refer to it with a pronoun simultaneously. There is no additional semantic information in the demonstrative, which directly refers to the present object. But the children are now using language as part of their act of reference. 3) Around 1; 05, the children replace the demonstrative “ça” with a noun and therefore name the object they are pointing. They combine a gesture to localize an object and a word with a referential value. 4) Around 1; 07, they start combining the spatial demonstrative “là” with a noun (“un cochon là” / “a pig there”). The demonstrative “là” is a spatial localizer, which simply reduplicates the pointing gesture and does not give any semantic information. It is therefore informationally redundant but seems to express the children's true appropriation of language : they have fully entered the verbal mode. At the end of our data, the children are making syntax and combine two words in addition to the pointing gesture, a lexical word and a <b>deictic</b> <b>word,</b> which enables them to anchor their production in the here and now. The pointing gesture seems to be the pivot of this developmental path. It enables the interlocutor to understand the children's communicative intent. At the end of the process, pointing simply helps disambiguate the reference of the target, which is clearly referred to and localized in the verbal mode...|$|E

Two experiments required participants to point at and/or name a close or distant target, with speech only, with gesture only, or with speech + gesture. Acoustic, articulatory, and manual data were recorded. We investigated the interaction between vocal and manual pointing, with respect to the distance to the target. There are two major findings. First, distance significantly affects both articulatory and manual pointing, since participants perform larger vocal and manual gestures to designate a more distant target. Second, modality influences both deictic speech and gesture, since pointing is more emphatic in unimodal use of either over bimodal use of both, to compensate for the loss of the other mode. These findings suggest that distance is encoded in both vocal and manual pointing. We also demonstrate that the correlates of distance encoding in the vocal modality can be related to the typology of <b>deictic</b> <b>words.</b> Finally, our data suggest a two-way interaction between speech and gesture, and support the hypothesis that these two modalities are cooperating within a single communication system...|$|R

40|$|ON THE ORIGIN OF SOME DEICTIC WORDS, INTENSIFYING WORDS AND ADVERBS Summary The {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the subject in question {{makes it possible to}} draw the following conclusions: 1. The <b>deictic</b> <b>words</b> ve, va, vei resp. ave, ava are not reiic forms of the mystic pronouns *vas resp. *avas. In Lithuanian dialects the words ve and vei are reduced from the imperative veiz(d) ėk or veiz(d) i of the verb veiz(d) ėti “to look”, in Latvian vei is reduced from the imperative *vei(z) di resp. ve from veries (cf. vērties “to look”). The variant va has originated from ve in unstressed posi­tion. The <b>deictic</b> <b>words</b> ava, ave derive from the interjection a expressing astonishment combined with the words va or ve. The final component -skat of the form anskat “over there” (resp. taskat “there”, šiskat “here”), which is used in East Prussian Lithuanian written records, is a survival of the reduced imperative skatyk of the former verb skatyti(s) “to look”, i. e. an(a) “over there” + skat “look”, cf. anavè ← ana “over there” + vè “look” Geistarai, etc. 2. The initial components ko, ka of the intensifying words kono, k апа are not particles origi­nally, they are genitives of the pronoun kas “who”. The final components -no and -na should be interpreted as an adaptation of the Slavonic nai, cf. Russ. наихудший, Pol. najliepszy to the Lithuanian forms k о and ka. The component ka is reduced from *k ā in unstressed position. 3. The components ko resp. to of the adverbs kõtik, konè, niẽko, nekõ as well as the conjunc­tion dėltõ are not particles originally, they are genitives of the pronouns kas and tas. </em...|$|R

30|$|Studies on {{formality}} are by {{no means}} rare, particularly for spoken and written languages. Early work, such as that of Joos (1961), presents five possible styles of spoken English ranked in order of their linguistic formality – from ‘intimate’ (most informal) to ‘frozen’ (most formal) – based upon certain contextual and linguistic characteristics. While studies would go on to evaluate and support these proposed styles (e.g., Broderick 1978), later studies have since superseded the notion of discrete levels of formality, demonstrating that formality is better schematised on a continuum ranging from ‘informal’ to ‘formal’ (Arndt and Janney 1987; Biber 1995; Rooy et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013). In these later studies, language is deemed more formal or more informal according to linguistic aspects, such as the frequency of <b>deictic</b> <b>words</b> (Heylighen and Dewaele 2002), and cognitive aspects including the amount of attention paid to speech (Labov 1984). A range of qualitative and quantitative methods have thereby been employed in research on formality.|$|R

Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children {{come into contact with}} spatial relations, they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as here or [...] "there" [...] for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as [...] "do" [...] and [...] "make" [...] for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.|$|R
40|$|It is {{predicted}} that by 2050 many countries could have around 30 or 40 % of their population aged over 65 years {{resulting in a}} huge social and economic impact, {{especially with regard to}} healthcare provision [1], [2]. This is likely to result in shortage of care workers [3], posing significant challenges to healthcare provision and additional pressure on informal carers [4]. To address these needs, promotion of wellbeing and independence for older people [5] is required, such as the long term care revolution [6]. Independence for older adults requires assistance with the ADL of which assistance with dressing is in the top 4 but has the lowest technological maturity and commercial development [7], possibly due to the inherent difficulties of close human-robot interaction in this area. The majority of older adults would prefer to stay at home {{for as long as possible}} and avoid the traumatic and costly procedure of moving to a care home [8]. General acceptance of this type of assistive technology must be specific to the user's need and expectations for a specific situation [9]. The expected interaction may use many modalities, of which speech may be preferred. However, one of the problematic issues is the semantic ambiguity of the vocabulary used, especially <b>deictic</b> <b>words</b> whose meaning is dependent on the context in which they are used. This paper investigates the occurrence of deictic speech in an assisted dressing task, the level of variability, and how any ambiguity could be resolved to ensure safe and reliable We construct decision tree models to evaluate accuracy of correct interpretation of ‘up’ when other, non-visual cues are used as inputs...|$|R
