The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12.

50|$|Although the {{outcomes}} (dependent variables) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> predicted <b>are</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> random variables, the explanatory variables themselves <b>are</b> usually not <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> random.

As a result, the model user {{is free to}} transform the explanatory variables in arbitrary ways, including creating multiple copies of a given explanatory variable, each transformed using a different function.

In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be the reason that they hate men.|$|E

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be {{the arrival of}} an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be {{the presence of}} a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
