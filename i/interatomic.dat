5|$|With their closed valence shells, {{the noble}} gases {{have the highest}} first {{ionization}} potentials in each of their periods, and feeble <b>interatomic</b> forces of attraction, with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points. That is why they are all gases under standard conditions, even those with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the <b>interatomic</b> forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to <b>interatomic</b> interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the {{autocorrelation}} function c(r) {{of the electron}} density (also known as the Patterson function) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this {{could be used to}} determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The {{autocorrelation function}} corresponds to the distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of N atoms in its unit cell may have N(N-1) peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the <b>interatomic</b> vectors, this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} <b>interatomic</b> contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E

25|$|By {{considering}} {{the arrangement of}} atoms relative to each other, their coordination numbers (or number of nearest neighbors), <b>interatomic</b> distances, types of bonding, etc., {{it is possible to}} form a general view of the structures and alternative ways of visualizing them.|$|E
25|$|Being {{the weakest}} {{of the weak}} {{chemical}} forces, with a strength between 0.4 and 4kJ/mol they may still support an integral structural load when multitudes of such interactions are present. Such a force results from a transient shift in electron density. Specifically, as the electrons are in orbit of the protons and neutrons within an atom the electron density may tend to shift more greatly on a side. Thus, this generates a transient charge to which a nearby atom can be either attracted or repelled. When the <b>interatomic</b> distance of two atoms is greater than 0.6 nm the force is {{not strong enough to}} be observed. In the same vein, when the <b>interatomic</b> distance is below 0.4 nm the force becomes repulsive.|$|E
25|$|CeN {{is unusual}} {{as it is}} a {{metallic}} conductor, contrasting with the other nitrides also with the other cerium pnictides. A simple description is Ce4+ N3− (e–) but the <b>interatomic</b> distances are a better match for the trivalent state rather than for the tetravalent state. A number of different explanations have been offered.|$|E
25|$|A classic {{molecular}} solid {{consists of}} small, non-polar covalent molecules, and is {{held together by}} London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic example is paraffin wax. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise <b>interatomic</b> binding energies {{on the order of}} 1/100 those of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular size and polarity (see intermediate forms).|$|E
25|$|Once the {{electronic}} and nuclear variables are separated (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the wave packet {{corresponding to the}} nuclear degrees of freedom is propagated via the time evolution operator (physics) associated to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (for the full molecular Hamiltonian). In the complementary energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the scattering theory formalism. The potential representing the <b>interatomic</b> interaction is given by the potential energy surfaces. In general, the potential energy surfaces are coupled via the vibronic coupling terms.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics simulation requires {{the definition of a}} potential function, or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a force field and in materials physics as an <b>interatomic</b> potential. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on molecular mechanics and embody a classical mechanics treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and conformational changes but usually cannot reproduce chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{computational}} {{cost of a}} water simulation {{increases with}} the number of interaction sites in the water model. The CPU time is approximately proportional to the number of <b>interatomic</b> distances that need to be computed. For the 3-site model, 9 distances are required for each pair of water molecules (every atom of one molecule against every atom of the other molecule, or 3 × 3). For the 4-site model, 10 distances are required (every charged site with every charged site, plus the O–O interaction, or 3 × 3 + 1). For the 5-site model, 17 distances are required (4 × 4 + 1). Finally, for the 6-site model, 26 distances are required (5 × 5 + 1).|$|E
25|$|Physics-based energy {{calculations}} aim {{to capture}} the <b>interatomic</b> interactions that are physically responsible for protein stability in solution, especially van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. These calculations are performed using a molecular mechanics force field; proteins are normally too large even for semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based calculations. The use of these methods {{is based on the}} energy landscape hypothesis of protein folding, which predicts that a protein's native state is also its energy minimum. Such methods usually employ implicit solvation, which provides a continuous approximation of a solvent bath for a single protein molecule without necessitating the explicit representation of individual solvent molecules. A force field specifically constructed for model assessment is known as the Effective Force Field (EFF) and is based on atomic parameters from CHARMM.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) is {{a computer}} simulation method for studying the physical movements of atoms and molecules, and is thus a type of N-body simulation. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving {{a view of the}} dynamic evolution of the system. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, where forces between the particles and their potential energies are calculated using <b>interatomic</b> potentials or molecular mechanics force fields. The method was originally developed within the field of theoretical physics in the late 1950s but is applied today mostly in chemical physics, materials science and the modelling of biomolecules.|$|E
25|$|Thallium is a soft, {{reactive}} metal (MH 1.0), {{so much so}} that it has no structural uses. It has a close-packed crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large <b>interatomic</b> distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its chalcogenides and trihalides. It {{is the only one of}} the Group 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl− thallide anion in the compound CsTl. Thallium forms Zintl phases, such as Na2Tl, Na2K21Tl19, CsTl and Sr5Tl3H.|$|E

They are all monatomic gases under standard conditions, including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements.

The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes. Radon has no stable isotopes; its longest-lived isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8days and decays to form helium and polonium, which ultimately decays to lead. Melting and boiling points generally increase going down the group.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band-gap}} {{energy of}} semiconductors tends to {{decrease with increasing}} temperature. When temperature increases, the amplitude of atomic vibrations increase, leading to larger <b>interatomic</b> spacing.

In strict thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field {{is said to be}} black-body radiation and is described by Planck's law. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field {{does not have to be}} a black-body field, but the rate of <b>interatomic</b> collisions must vastly exceed the rates of absorption and emission of quanta of light, so that the <b>interatomic</b> collisions entirely dominate the distribution of states of atomic excitation. Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm the tendency to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities.

In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, at altitudes over 100km, the rarity of intermolecular collisions is decisive.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{resonating}} {{valence bond}} theory, {{the factors that}} determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among <b>interatomic</b> positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability {{is associated with the}} simplest ratios or [...] "bond numbers": , , , , , etc. The choice of structure and the value of the axial ratio (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.|$|E

Pauling also considered {{the nature of the}} <b>interatomic</b> forces in metals, and concluded that about half of the five d-orbitals in the transition metals are involved in bonding, with the remaining nonbonding d-orbitals being responsible for the magnetic properties. He, therefore, was able to correlate the number of d-orbitals in bond formation with the bond length as well as many of the physical properties of the substance. He subsequently introduced the metallic orbital, an extra orbital necessary to permit uninhibited resonance of valence bonds among various electronic structures.|$|E
2500|$|Copper(I) iodide, {{like most}} [...] "binary" [...] (containing only two elements) metal halides, is an {{inorganic}} polymer. [...] It has a rich phase diagram, {{meaning that it}} exists in several crystalline forms.

[...] The ions are tetrahedrally coordinated when in the zinc blende or the wurtzite structure, with a Cu-I distance of 2.338 Å. [...] Copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride also transform from the zinc blende structure to the wurtzite structure at 405 and 435°C, respectively. Therefore, the longer the copper – halide bond length, the lower the temperature needs to be to change the structure from the zinc blende structure to the wurtzite structure. The <b>interatomic</b> distances in copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride are 2.173 and 2.051 Å, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is {{a collection}} of boson atoms that are all in the same quantum state.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to using helium atoms {{as compared with}} x-rays, neutrons, and electrons to probe a surface and study its structures and phonon dynamics. [...] As mentioned previously, the lightweight helium atoms at thermal energies do not penetrate into {{the bulk of the}} material being studied. [...] This means that in addition to being strictly surface-sensitive they are truly non-destructive to the sample. [...] Their de Broglie wavelength is also on the order of the <b>interatomic</b> spacing of materials, making them ideal probing particles. [...] Since they are neutral, helium atoms are insensitive to surface charges. [...] As a noble gas, the helium atoms are chemically inert. [...] When used at thermal energies, as is the usual scenario, the helium atomic beam is an inert probe (chemically, electrically, magnetically, and mechanically). [...] It is therefore capable of studying the surface structure and dynamics {{of a wide variety of}} materials, including those with reactive or metastable surfaces. [...] A helium atom beam can even probe surfaces in the presence of electromagnetic fields and during ultra-high vacuum surface processing without interfering with the ongoing process. [...] Because of this, helium atoms can be useful to make measurements of sputtering or annealing, and adsorbate layer depositions. [...] Finally, because the thermal helium atom has no rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom and no available electronic transitions, only the translational kinetic energy of the incident and scattered beam need be analyzed in order to extract information about the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Strictly speaking, ASA-based models {{should only}} be applied to {{describe}} solvation, i.e., energetics of transfer between liquid or uniform media. [...] It is possible to express van der Waals interaction energies in the solid state in the surface energy units. This was sometimes done for interpreting protein engineering and ligand binding energetics, which leads to “solvation” parameter for aliphatic carbon of ~40 cal/(Å2 mol), which is 2 times bigger than ~20 cal/(Å2 mol) obtained for transfer from water to liquid hydrocarbons, because the parameters derived by such fitting represent sum of the hydrophobic energy (i.e., 20 cal/Å2 mol) and energy of van der Waals attractions of aliphatic groups in the solid state, which corresponds to fusion enthalpy of alkanes. [...] Unfortunately, the simplified ASA-based model cannot capture the [...] "specific" [...] distance-dependent interactions between different types of atoms in the solid state which are responsible for clustering of atoms with similar polarities in protein structures and molecular crystals. [...] Parameters of such <b>interatomic</b> interactions, together with atomic solvation parameters for the protein interior, have been approximately derived from protein engineering data. [...] The implicit solvation model breaks down when solvent molecules associate strongly with binding cavities in a protein, so that the protein and the solvent molecules form a continuous solid body. [...] On the other hand, this model can be successfully applied for describing transfer from water to the fluid lipid bilayer.|$|E
2500|$|Limits of {{the method}} {{are related to the}} {{parameter}} sets used, and to the underlying molecular mechanics force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the potential energy, rather than the free energy of the protein , meaning that all entropic contributions to thermodynamic stability of protein structure are neglected, including the conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and hydrophobic effects (the main driving forces of protein folding). Another important factor are intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are not explicitly included in modern force fields, but described as Coulomb interactions of atomic point charges. This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially quantum mechanical and chemical nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the dielectric constant of vacuum, although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the macroscopic dielectric constant at short <b>interatomic</b> distances is questionable. Finally, van der Waals interactions in MD are usually described by Lennard-Jones potentials based on the Fritz London theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on dielectric properties of the environment. The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as Hamaker constant) shows that [...] "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum". The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.|$|E

[...] This experimentally established the feasibility of atom diffraction when the de Broglie wavelength, λ, of the impinging atoms is {{on the order of}} the <b>interatomic</b> spacing of the material. [...] At the time, the major limit to the experimental resolution of this method was due to the large velocity spread of the helium beam. [...] It wasn't until the development of high pressure nozzle sources capable of producing intense and strongly monochromatic beams in the 1970s that HAS gained popularity for probing surface structure. [...] Interest in studying the collision of rarefied gases with solid surfaces was helped by a connection with aeronautics and space problems of the time. [...] Plenty of studies showing the fine structures in the diffraction pattern of materials using helium atom scattering were published in the 1970s. [...] However, it wasn't until a third generation of nozzle beam sources was developed, around 1980, that studies of surface phonons could be made by helium atom scattering. [...] These nozzle beam sources were capable of producing helium atom beams with an energy resolution of less than 1meV, making it possible to explicitly resolve the very small energy changes resulting from the inelastic collision of a helium atom with the vibrational modes of a solid surface, so HAS could now be used to probe lattice dynamics. [...] The first measurement of such a surface phonon dispersion curve was reported in 1981 , leading to a renewed interest in helium atom scattering applications, particularly for the study of surface dynamics.|$|E

If this ether is a continuous substance, therefore, we have got back from the hypothesis of Dalton to that of Descartes.
