40|$|Gas {{turbines}} casings {{are susceptible}} to cracking {{at the edge of}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>pin</b> hole, which is the most likely position for crack initiation and propagation. This paper describes the improvement of transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of gas turbines casings through the application of additional holes. The crack position and direction was determined using non-destructive tests. A series of finite element patterns were developed and tested in ASTM-A 395 elastic perfectly-plastic ductile cast iron. The effect of arrangement of additional holes on transient thermal fatigue behavior of gas turbines casings containing hole edge cracks was investigated. ABAQUS finite element package and Zencrack fracture mechanics code were used for modeling. The effect of the reduction of transient thermal stress distribution around the <b>eccentric</b> <b>pin</b> hole on the transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of the gas turbines casings was discussed. The result shows that transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life could be extended by applying additional holes of larger diameter and decreased by increasing the vertical distance, angle, and distance between the <b>eccentric</b> <b>pin</b> hole and the additional holes. The results from the numerical predictions were compared with experimental data...|$|E
30|$|In the {{presence}} of a pin site infection, the risk of intramedullary infection is increased from 6 to 70  % in patients undergoing conversion from external to internal fixation (p =  0.003) [31]. These observations were based on the treatment of severe open tibia fractures with an intense post-injury inflammatory response and that the conversion from external to internal fixation was immediate without a hardware-free period to treat the pin infections. Furthermore, the half pins used in these patients were mostly 5  mm, self-drilling and not hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated pins—all of which make infection more probable. The conversion from external fixation to internal fixation has become common in limb lengthening and is highlighted by the lengthening and then nailing (LATN) technique [43]. In LATN, there is no contact between the components used for external and internal fixation. The pins and wires are placed peripherally in the proximal tibia and distal to the planned site of the tip of the nail (out {{of the way of the}} future IM nail) to prevent the nail from passing through a previous pin site to minimize contamination. Pre-drilling the bone, using 6 -mm HA-coated pins, and meticulous technique can make the conversion from external to internal fixation safe. In cases where <b>eccentric</b> <b>pin</b> placement was not used and conversion to internal fixation after prolonged external fixation is needed, we used a specific protocol; the external fixator was removed, the limb was casted, and internal fixation delayed for a minimum of 1  month [44]. With this method, deep infection occurred in 2.5  % of patients and resolved without sequelae after hardware removal and 6  weeks of intravenous antibiotics [44]. Recently, we have used an intramedullary nail that is coated with antibiotic infused bone cement [65].|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} model for heat generation for <b>eccentric</b> cylindrical <b>pin</b> in {{friction stir welding}} was developed that utilizes a new factor based on the tool pin eccentricity. The proposed analytical expression is a modification of previous {{analytical model}}s from the literature, which is verified and well matches with the model developed by previous researchers. Results of plunge force and peak temperature were used to validate the current proposed model. The cylindrical tool pin with eccentricities of 0, 0. 2, and 0. 8 mm were used to weld two types of aluminum alloys; a low deformation resistant AA 1050 -H 12, and a relatively high deformation resistant AA 5754 -H 24 alloy. The FSW was performed at constant tool rotation speed of 600 rpm and different welding speeds of 100, 300, and 500 mm/min. Experimental results implied that less temperature is generated using <b>eccentric</b> cylindrical <b>pin</b> than cylindrical pin without eccentricity under the given set of FSW process conditions. Furthermore, numerical simulation results show that increasing the pin eccentricity leads to decrease in peak temperature...|$|R
50|$|The final {{form of the}} gab {{valve gear}} was the 'closed' gab. Like the X-gab, this was a coupled pair of gabs, {{although}} in this case they faced inwards {{and there was a}} single pin between them. Once again, the gabs were driven by the <b>eccentrics</b> and the <b>pin</b> drove the valve spindle.|$|R
40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large drive ring actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three pin levers rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the drive ring, which drives the push rods and therefore the pin levers, which in turn rotate the <b>eccentric</b> <b>pins,</b> finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial translation (focus adjustment) of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push rods, <b>pin</b> levers and <b>eccentric</b> <b>pins.</b> If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the drive ring. Neither method provides for a direct measurement of the quantity desired (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (drive ring rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of manufacturing processes to assure product quality {{and reduce the}} amount of raw material and energy is the main objective of many recent researches. Some of them study cross wedge rolling (CWR) as a substitute to hot upsetting in the manufacture of stepped shafts, <b>pins,</b> <b>eccentric</b> shafts and many other mechanical parts. In this process a cylinder is deformed by two wedge tools assembled on plane plates that move tangentially one against the other. The main objective of this work is to study the thermomechanical behaviour of medium carbon steel during hot CWR by means of a numerical analysis. The numerical results will be compared to the microstructure of microalloyed steel samples which were submitted to CWR experimental tests. The results suggested that dynamic recrystallization was present during CWR and that microstructures in the austenitic region were very refined...|$|R
