When {{the age of the}} samples was determined by paleontologic and isotopic dating studies, this provided conclusive evidence for the seafloor spreading hypothesis, and, consequently, for plate tectonics.|$|E
50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from High Speed Steel material. These are most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> or annular cutters in market. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for smaller {{diameter}} i.e 40 mm. The biggest advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is its ability to}} re-sharpen. Unlike TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills,</b> HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> re-sharpened and used with good efficiency until the desirable length is remaining. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have longer service life, high heat resistance: the charecteristics of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that <b>drilling</b> with these <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be done without the use of excessive force.|$|R

50|$|The climatic {{history of}} the region is speculated to have a {{connection}} to human migrations {{at the end of}} the last ice age about 11,000 years ago. The desert returned to the area after monsoons diminished about 5,000 years ago. Investigation of a <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> revealed 10,940 layers in 16 m of sediments from the bottom of the Lake Yoa before reaching the ice-age desert floor, each layer corresponding to 1 year.|$|E

A geological timeline—created from a <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> sample—runs along the platform walls. The eastbound platform is marked by yellow roof girders, symbolizing the sunrise; the westbound platform has orange roof girders, symbolizing the sunset. The platforms were nicknamed Sunrise and Sunset, respectively, by TriMet.|$|E
50|$|Until 1983, no one {{suspected}} {{the existence of}} a large impact crater buried beneath {{the lower part of the}} Chesapeake Bay and its surrounding peninsulas. The first hint was a 20 cm-thick layer of ejecta that turned up in a <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> taken off Atlantic City, New Jersey, far to the north. The layer contained the fused glass beads called tektites and shocked quartz grains that are unmistakable signs of a bolide impact.|$|E
50|$|TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from Tungsten Carbide {{material}} on their tips. Tungsten carbide is a very hard material and supposed {{to be one of}} the hardest materials made by man. TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are more expensive then HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of tip breakage in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is more compared to HSS <b>Core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> because of its price and re-sharpening advantages.|$|R
50|$|A Standard TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> has {{tungsten}} carbide tips. These types of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are now available}} in vast range of diameter, for up to 150 mm. These are popularly used <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> on magnetic <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> machines. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are popularly used to drill materials like railway tracks, structural steel, stainless steel, cast iron, etc.|$|R

5000|$|A 1 mm thick ash layer {{found in}} a <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> {{off the coast of}} Israel (...) was dated at 8,365 ± 65 years ago in uncalibrated {{radiocarbon}} years. It appears to be linked to one of these three eruptions {{on the basis of its}} composition, most likely the [...] eruption, over 600 km away from the <b>drilling</b> <b>core.</b> A tephra layer named Tyam-1, found in [...] in Lebanon and dated at 8,600 ± 850 years before present, is probably equivalent to this ash layer. Likewise, a thin tephra layer in the Sodmein Cave of the Red Sea Mountains, 1300 km south of Erciyes, has been linked to the [...] eruption. Other tephras identified in the Levantine Sea and erupted between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago may also come from Erciyes. The eruptions that formed all these layers probably had profound effects on the affected Mediterranean cultures. Another tephra layer found in the Black Sea appears to come from either the [...] or the [...] eruptions. The tephra from these eruptions thus was probably spread northeastward, in contrast to the [...] eruption, which spread tephra southeastward and thus is not found in the Black Sea.|$|E
5000|$|Diagenesis {{could be}} a problem when {{analyzing}} detrital records especially when dealing with ancient sediments which are always lithified. Variation of clay minerals in detrital record may not reflect variation of provenance rock, but burial effect. For example, clay minerals become unstable at great depth, kaolinite and smectite become illte. If there is a downward increasing trend of illite components in a <b>drilling</b> <b>core,</b> we can not conclude that early detrital record indicate more illite-yield source rock but possibly as a result of burial and alternation of minerals ...|$|E

50|$|Later evidence, such as <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> data, {{indicates}} {{two distinct}} lake stages, one 185,000-128,000 {{years ago and}} another 35,000-10,000 years ago. This corresponds to oxygen isotope stage 6 and 2 respectively. Between 120,000 and 60,000 years ago there was no lake in Death Valley, and separate saline lakes existed between 60,000 and 35,000 years ago. Lake levels in Lake Manly appear to track {{the size of the}} Laurentide ice sheet but only very roughly so. Further, last glacial maximum highstands of Lake Manly appear to precede highstands of Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville, probably due to a northward shift of the jet stream.|$|E
50|$|Proof is the {{one thing}} {{currently}} wanting in any quest to label the anomalous round zone on the upper Diamantina an asteroid impact structure. However, the scientists involved see that as rather a straightforward matter of <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> samples in the zone and then analyzing them. Richard Blewett from Geoscience Australia quoted the needed depth for these samples as “about three kilometres”, whereas Geoscience Australia says in its own report, somewhat more conservatively, that the depth will have to be “many hundreds of metres”. Analysis of the core samples would involve, among other things, the detection of “shock textures” in the rock, caused by the great energy of an asteroid impact.|$|E
50|$|Joggins {{has been}} known for its fossils since the early 19th century. The fossils are found in the exposed Pennsylvanian coal seams in the cliffs that {{overlook}} the shore. The fossils consist mainly of ferns, prehistoric trees and early sea life. The daily high tide erodes the cliff, the stone fossils fall out of the coal and are left on the shore when the tide recedes. Fossils have also been found in the area deep shaft mines and in <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> samples hundreds of feet down. Joggins is one of the easiest places in the world to find early Pennsylvanian coal fossils. In 2008, the Joggins Fossil Cliffs were designated as a UNESCO natural heritage site.|$|E

[...] In 1919, {{while working as a}} consultant to the British entrepreneur Lord Cowdray, DeGolyer negotiated the sale of the El Aguila company to Royal Dutch Shell. In the same year, DeGolyer organized the formation of the Rycade Oil Company as well as the Amerada Petroleum Corporation for Lord Cowdray, rising to become general manager, president, and chairman from 1929 to 1932 DeGolyer left the firm in 1932, but remained with Rycade, which was established to explore salt dome oil deposits through 1941. As a geophysical consultant with Rycade, DeGolyer made the first torsion balance survey in the United States at the Spindletop oilfield. An oilfield found by DeGolyer on behalf of Rycade at Nash, Texas was the first oilfield anywhere to be discovered using geophysics. From 1925 DeGolyer established the Geophysical Research Corporation as a subsidiary of Amerada to develop reflection seismology techniques originated by J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott, leaving in 1932 to move to Dallas, Texas. DeGolyer provided financial support for the 1930 establishment of GRC's successor, Geophysical Service Incorporated. GSI went on to spin off Texas Instruments. [...] In 1936 with Lewis MacNaughton, DeGolyer established the petroleum exploration consulting firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Core Laboratories, Incorporated the same year to provide <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> and fluids analysis. DeGolyer was also associated with the Atlatl Royalty Company from 1932 to 1950 and the Felmont Corporation in 1934.

The apparent volume ratio of aphyric versus porphyritic lavas is approximately 1 : 1 in the <b>drilling</b> <b>core</b> samples of the Older Oshima Group (Fujii et al. 1996). During the post-caldera stage (the Younger Oshima Group), porphyritic lavas with accumulated plagioclase phenocrysts erupted at the early stage of each summit eruption and were followed by eruptions of aphyric lavas (Nakano and Yamamoto 1991). These observations suggest that plagioclase accumulated by floating in the basaltic melt during the dormant stage, {{which resulted in the}} formation of a porphyritic magma layer in {{the upper part of the}} magma chamber and its emission at the onset of each eruption (Aramaki and Fujii 1988).|$|E
