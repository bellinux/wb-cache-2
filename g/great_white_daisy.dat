50|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{simulation}} documents what happens as the sun's luminosity continues to increase, heating the surface of Daisyworld beyond a comfortable range for the daisies. This temperature increase causes <b>white</b> <b>daisies,</b> who are better able to stay cool because of their high albedo or ability to reflect sunlight, to gain a selective advantage over the black <b>daisies.</b> <b>White</b> <b>daisies</b> begin replacing black daisies, which has a cooling effect on Daisyworld. The result is that Daisyworld's surface temperature remains habitable - in fact almost constant - even as the luminosity of the sun continues to increase.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the model is to {{demonstrate}} that feedback mechanisms can evolve from the actions or activities of self-interested organisms, rather than through classic group selection mechanisms. Daisyworld examines the energy budget of a planet populated by {{two different types of}} plants, black <b>daisies</b> and <b>white</b> <b>daisies.</b> The colour of the daisies influences the albedo of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while <b>white</b> <b>daisies</b> reflect light and cool the planet. Competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a balance of populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.|$|R

50|$|In {{the third}} phase of the simulation, the sun's rays have grown so {{powerful}} that soon even the <b>white</b> <b>daisies</b> can no longer survive.

50|$|In {{this first}} phase of the {{simulation}} we see that black daisies have warmed Daisyworld so that it is habitable over a wider range of solar luminosity than would have been possible on a barren, gray planet.

50|$|Daisyworld, a {{computer}} simulation, is a hypothetical world orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. It {{is meant to}} mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system, and was introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson in a paper published in 1983 to illustrate the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis. In the original 1983 version, Daisyworld is seeded with two varieties of daisy as its only life forms: black <b>daisies</b> and <b>white</b> <b>daisies.</b> <b>White</b> petaled <b>daisies</b> reflect light, while black petaled daisies absorb light. The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun's rays grow more powerful. The surface temperature of Daisyworld remains almost constant over {{a broad range of}} solar output.|$|R

50|$|At {{this point}} in the {{simulation}} solar luminosity is programmed to decline, retracing its original path to its initial value. Even as it declines to levels that previously supported vast populations of daisies in the third phase, no daisies are able to grow because the surface of barren, gray Daisyworld is still far too hot. Eventually, the sun's rays decrease in power to a more comfortable level which allows <b>white</b> <b>daisies</b> to grow, who begin cooling the planet.|$|R

40|$|The daisyworld {{model of}} Watson and Lovelock {{demonstrated}} that a simple biological feedback system involving coupling {{between black and}} <b>white</b> <b>daisies</b> and their physical environment can stabilize planetary temperature {{over a wide range}} of solar luminosity. Here, we show that the addition of a diVerential equation for temperature to the original daisyworld model leads to periodic oscillations in temperature about a homeostatic mean. These oscillations, in which the model alternates between dominance by either black or <b>white</b> <b>daisies,</b> arise from the internal dynamics of the system rather than from external forcing. An important criterion for the oscilla-tions to occur is that solar luminosity be within the range in which both daisy species are viable. A second important criterion is that the ratio of the timescales for daisy population turnover and climate system thermal response be bounded. While internally driven oscillations are well known in predator–prey biological models and in coupled ocean energy balance– cryosphere models, the present study shows that such oscillations also can arise in a model of the biosphere coupled to its physical environment. The potential significance of this result to planet Earth and the science of geophysiology is discussed...|$|R
