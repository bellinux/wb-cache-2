5|$|Loitering weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s.

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|Biochrons for aetosaur genera <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> dating strata in the Chinle Group of {{the southwestern}} United States. Up to 13 genera of aetosaurs are {{known from the}} Chinle Group, with most {{occurring}} in multiple localities and over short time spans. In 1996, paleontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Andrew B. Heckert recognized five biochrons based {{on the presence of}} aetosaurs throughout the Chinle Group. The number of biochrons grew to 11 in a 2007 study by Heckert and Lucas along with Adrian P. Hunt and Justin A. Spielmann. These biochrons occurred from the Otischalkian LVF to the Apachean LVF and included genera such as Longosuchus, Tecovasuchus, and Typothorax.|$|E

It was also compatible with the newly released Game Boy Advance SP, an upgraded version of the GBA. Prior to 2017, the game's Japanese subtitle was translated as The Sword of Flame. In 2017, the subtitle was officially translated by Nintendo as The Blazing Blade. The game was later released on the Virtual Console for Wii U on May 14, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{loitering}} weapons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> additional roles {{beyond the}} initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use {{such as the}} AeroVironment Switchblade which is deployed at the platoon level and fits in a backpack. A documented use of loitering munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E
5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> covalently linking DNA {{to the surface of}} polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E

5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The {{intensity of the}} source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, {{hundreds of thousands of}} individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>for</b> housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E
