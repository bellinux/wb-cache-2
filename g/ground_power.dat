2500|$|After {{the tank}} was filled for ground testing, {{it could not}} be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by {{replacing}} the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of [...] When the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered.

2500|$|The C-5C is a {{specially}} modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5s (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified {{to have a}} larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were {{the removal of the}} rear passenger compartment floor, splitting the rear cargo door in the middle, and installing a new movable aft bulkhead further to the rear. [...] The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) Space Cargo Modified. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for <b>ground</b> <b>power,</b> which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California. Both 68-0213 and 68-0216 completed the Avionics Modernization Program by January 2007. 68-0213 is being upgraded in RERP to the C-5M (SCM) standard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{a ground}} fault occurs on an {{overhead}} transmission line in a <b>power</b> network with <b>grounded</b> neutral, the fault current returns to the grounded neutral through the tower structures, ground return paths and ground wires.

The effect of soil resistivity, ground resistance of towers and power line configuration, on the magnitude of return currents, has been examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{ground fault}} current {{distribution}} in an effectively <b>grounded</b> <b>power</b> network {{is affected by}} various factors, such as: tower footing impedances, spans lengths, configuration and parameters of overhead <b>ground</b> wires and <b>power</b> conductors, soil resistivity etc. In this paper, we comparatively analyze, using different models, the ground fault current distribution in a single circuit transmission line with one ground wire. A parametric comparative analysis was done in order to {{study the effects of}} the non-uniformity of the towers footing impedances, number of power lines spans, soil resistivity, grounding systems resistances of the terminal substations etc., on the ground fault current distribution.

There are also presented some useful quantitative results obtained through a dedicated developed MATLAB 7. 0 program.

50|$|A <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> unit (GPU) is {{a vehicle}} capable of {{supplying}} power to aircraft {{parked on the}} ground. <b>Ground</b> <b>power</b> units may also be built into the jetway, making it even easier to supply electrical power to aircraft. Many aircraft require 28 V of direct current and 115 V 400 Hz of alternating current. The electric energy is carried from a generator to a connection on the aircraft via 3 phase 4-wire insulated cable capable of handling 261 amps (90 kVA). These connectors are standard for all aircraft, as defined in ISO 6858.|$|E
