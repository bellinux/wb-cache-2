5000|$|Deep or {{confined}} wells are sunk {{through an}} <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum</b> into an aquifer that is sandwiched between two impermeable strata (aquitards or aquicludes). The majority of deep aquifers {{are classified as}} artesian because the hydraulic head in a confined well {{is higher than the}} level of the top of the aquifer. If the hydraulic head in a confined well is higher than the land surface it is a [...] "flowing" [...] artesian well (named after Artois in France).|$|E
5000|$|Anticlines, {{structural}} domes, fault {{zones and}} stratigraphic traps are very favorable locations {{for oil and}} natural gas drilling. About 80 percent of the world’s petroleum has been found in anticlinal traps. [...] The low density of petroleum causes oil to buoyantly migrate out of its source rock and upward toward the surface until it is trapped and stored in reservoir rock such as sandstone or porous limestone. The oil becomes trapped along with water and natural gas by a caprock that is made up of impermeable barrier such as an <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum</b> or fault zone. Examples of low-permeability seals that contain the hydrocarbons, oil and gas, in the ground include shale, limestone, sandstone, and even salt domes. The actual type of stratum does not matter as long as it has low permeability.|$|E
50|$|Two broad {{classes of}} well are shallow or {{unconfined}} wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum</b> into an aquifer beneath. A collector well {{can be constructed}} adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. Water may be pumped or hand drawn. Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. Another environmental problem {{is the potential for}} methane to seep into the water.|$|E
30|$|For {{the future}} mining activity, {{it has been}} studied and found {{that there is no}} {{possibility}} of sea water intrusion through upconing of saline water interface due to the presence of <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> in between lignite maximum depth from MSL and undisturbed fresh and saline water interface.|$|R
25|$|Within the mantle, carbon {{may exist}} as hydrocarbons—chiefly methane—and as {{elemental}} carbon, carbon dioxide, and carbonates. The abiotic {{hypothesis is that}} the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes, or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons, and that the source-hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the crust until they escape to the surface or are trapped by <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata,</b> forming petroleum reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Underground {{water is}} very {{important}} in Hungary, especially on the Great Plain. Stratum water is abundant because Hungary {{is in the middle of}} the Carpathian Basin. These water resources are between two <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> underlying the first impervious stratum beneath the underground water. They are predominantly of rainfall origin, mostly not from Hungary, but from the surrounding higher-lying parts of the Carpathian Basin. This water, when brought to the surface from great depths, is rich in various mineral solutions and may be very hot.|$|R
5000|$|Radegast is {{situated}} at {{the margin of the}} Köthen culture plain. Here it ascends from the Fuhne valley, so the difference in height is about 6 m on a short distance. The town {{is situated}} {{right in the middle of}} a former swampland. The upper level of this swamp has been quite fertile for a long time. The official Radegast Chronicle says, [...] "the lower level of the soil in this area is not bad, but its value is lowered because it is too damp." [...] The upper level to a depth of about 0.3 m is meadowland with a lush vegetation of grasses and swampland, which is very fertile and became very calcareous, too because of the stagnant water. This is followed by peat, which was cut for being used as peat coal in former times. The upper level is bordered by an <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum</b> of clay. At shallow depth large boulders can be found from ice age deposits. The quality of the soil became a lot better because of its agricultural use. It offers perfect conditions for cultivating sugar beets and wheat.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAiming at the {{cylinder}} grouting manner, {{according to the}} character of complex function, and based on the natural boundary element theory and Fourier series method, interaction problems of multiple holes grouting with arbitrary forms of hole-sitting are investigated for osmotic grouting. Considering the wall of the vertical shaft as <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum,</b> the seepage pressure solution of exterior vertical shaft is deduced. The serum pressure distribution and relationships between serum pressure and consolidating distance are obtained. The results show that the grouting pressure of the shaft wall will increase while the radius of hole-sitting is small, and accordingly, the shaft wall will suffer from bad influence; the stratum can not be consolidated well if the radius of hole-sitting is large; when the consolidating width keeps the same, there is an optimal consolidating distance and the relative consolidating distance will be 2 ∼ 4...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to previous studies {{according to which}} skin barrier disruptions result in increased penetration of irritants with aggravation of inflammatory disease [22], we could not detect any effects of AHAPS-SiO 2 -NP on the quality or degree of inflammation. Specifically, our results are at variance with previous studies using negatively charged SiO 2 -NP that had aggravated allergic reactions in the skin and airways including the same dose as used here [4 – 8]. Among possible explanations of this discrepancy {{is the fact that}} AHAPS-SiO 2 -NP do not penetrate beyond the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin, in normal and irritated skin, including the mice used here. The distribution and levels of penetration of AHAPS-SiO 2 -NP on the skin of ACD mice have been studied in detail in a previous report of our group [17]. In that study, no pathological changes were recorded in healthy mice following exposure to AHAPS-SiO 2 -NP [17]. Furthermore, NP had been injected intradermally in the majority of previous studies [5, 6]. Consequently, in these studies, the SiO 2 -NP reach viable epidermal layers and may directly interact with keratinocytes and immune cells. Thus, an injection poorly models the in vivo situation in human and murine ACD where NP are topically applied to the skin and have to overcome the relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>stratum</b> corneum [23] especially when the thickness is increased due to hyperkeratosis. External, topical application of NP was reported only in a single study so far [7] in which a mild aggravation of skin lesions was observed. However, in that study, the SiO 2 -NP were applied simultaneously with mite antigen over a 4 -week period with three applications per week. So far, the effects of topical SiO 2 -NP exposure to an already existing ACD have not been studied although ACD is a common skin disorder in Western European and North American people with a prevalence of about 20 % [9]. As reported by several studies, even higher values for IgE, mast cells, eosinophils, and CD 3 -positive cells could have been expected in inflamed mouse skin. It therefore seems likely that NP-induced aggravation of the ACD would still have been detectable in the background of our Ox-induced inflammation [5, 24 – 26]. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} surface functionalization improves the biocompatibility of SiO 2 -NP [10, 11]. Therefore, both the failure of penetrating beyond the stratum corneum and the improved biocompatibility due to functionalization may have prevented the aggravation of barrier defects and inflammatory response in our study. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that effects would have occurred if significantly higher doses would have been used. Still, the dose used here appears to reflect a realistic condition and offers optimal comparability with the previous studies on unfunctionalized and functionalized SiO 2 -NP [5, 8, 17].|$|E
50|$|The {{rock salt}} that {{is found in}} salt domes is mostly impermeable. As the salt moves up towards the surface, it can {{penetrate}} and/or bend strata of existing rock with it. As these strata are penetrated, they are generally bent slightly upwards {{at the point of}} contact with the dome, and can form pockets where petroleum and natural gas can collect between <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> of rock and the salt. The strata immediately above the dome that are not penetrated are pushed upward, creating a dome-like reservoir above the salt where petroleum can also gather. These oil pools can eventually be extracted, and indeed form a major source of the petroleum produced along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
40|$|Important {{controlling}} {{factors of}} mass movements are generally soil water and geometric-topographic terrain {{factors such as}} inclination, curvature type and degree, and the relative position of unstable slopes and embankments. In addition, various geologic parameters that have a direct or indirect connection to soil-mechanical properties of slide masses are also of importance. Some studies also emphasise tectonic parameters {{in the context of}} susceptibility to mass movements. This study considers the relevance of tectonic and structural parameters in bedrock formations for landslides in periglacial hillslope sediments on top of the bedrock. The research area is part of the southern Solling anticline, a saddle structure in the Middle Bunter Sandstone formation in northern Hesse and southern Lower Saxony (Germany). In this geologic formation, sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone are interbedded with <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata.</b> Uplift of the Solling anticline, in particular during the Quaternary, resulted in a partially intensive dissection of the Bunter Sandstone plateau into separate blocks with disrupted, tilted, and partially rotated layers. The structural conditions have an indirect impact upon landslides in the superposed hillslope sediments. Water flow along strata and joints above water <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> cause water infiltration and moistening of the periglacial hillslope sediments on top of the bedrock. Mass movements are frequently linked to sites of outcrop springs and occur after long periods of rainfall. A GIS-based analysis was used to statistically evaluate possible factors controlling landslides. Factors were weighted and included in an empiric-statistical model that allows spatial description of hazard potentials due to mass movements. In addition to morphologic parameters, the structural parameters of the bedrock are of utmost importance for the occurrence of landslides...|$|R
40|$|Since 1970, {{abnormally}} high methane emissions {{have been}} observed in eastern sections of the Federal No. 2 Mine operating in the Pittsburgh Coalbed in northern West Virginia. The nature and volume of these emissions indicate a source other than the coalbed. An investigation was undertaken to delineate probable methane sources. Gas well information and stratigraphic correlation of corehole data indicates that a sandstone directly above the main coalbed is an additional source of methane emissions. The sandstone body {{appears to be an}} ancient stream channel, infilled with fine-grained sand and organic matter. Coalification of the organic matter produced methane as a byproduct. Additional methane presumably migrated into the sandstone unit from the subjacent coalbeds. The methane became trapped in the porous clasticunit by the surrounding <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata.</b> Mine development near this unit creates a significant pressure gradient, triggering abnormal methane emissions into the mine along naturally occurring fractures. Pre-development methane drainage of the sandstone could be accomplished by completing vertical boreholes along its trend...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{geothermal}} {{development for}} the township of North Bonneville, Washington is being investigated because of {{the proximity of the}} town to hot springs in a geologic province of good geothermal potential. Surface expression of geothermal resources is provided by conduits through an impermeable reservoir cap and is therefore generally structurally controlled. Near North Bonneville the geologic formations that underlie potential drilling sites are the Eagle Creek formation and the Ohanpecosh Formation. The Lower Miocene Eagle Creek Formation is composed of poorly consolidated volcanic conglomerates, sandstones, tuffs, and includes a few minor interbedded lava flows. The Eocene-Oligiocene Ohanapecosh (Weigle) Formation in its nearest exposures to North Bonneville is composed of volcaniclastics and lava flows. The Ohanapecosh has been altered to zeolites and clays and is therefore well consolidated and impermeable. The lack of permeability provides the necessary reservoir cap for any geothermal system that may be present at depth. This formation, to the northeast, in the Wind River drainage is greater than 19, 000 ft. thick. Circulation of geothermal heated water from this thick sequence of <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> must be associated with penetrating fracture zones...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} existing airborne baseline geophysical data {{in relation to the}} hydrogeological characterization of protected groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems (wetlands) in Anglesey, Wales. The attenuation of the radiometric data identifies the main areas of water saturation in the very near surface. The radiometric data have the potential to identify additional areas where similar degrees of saturation exist. The data may therefore be used to help define extensions to existing site boundaries and to provide information in the assessment of new wetland areas. The radiometric data also show regional-scale transition from the Carboniferous Limestone in the east, important for water supply to the wetlands, to older more <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> to the west. The conductivity data appear capable of mapping the lateral extent of clay accumulations, concealed below peat cover which can act as a confining layer to the bedrock aquifer. At the regional scale the data reveal the extent of a former Holocene lake system and the hydrogeological control of a Carboniferous limestone–sandstone contact. The data therefore provide a non-invasive spatially continuous, characterization of the sites, improving the understanding of their dynamic water balances and, potentially, guiding further ground assessments and invasive investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} {{potential of}} the Viking Formation and coeval units is described {{on the basis of}} core descriptions, geophysical well logs, drill-stem-test data, and the earliest drilling records in three areas of detailed study in Saskatchewan and western Manitoba. Sandstone bodies in the different areas are compared to account for Viking depositional patterns. Potential, new exploration targets are identified. The Viking-Newcastle succession should be regarded as prospective for hydrocarbons. There are many promising structural and stratigraphic traps. Porous reservoirs combined with trapping mechanisms, such as updip pinch-outs of <b>strata,</b> enveloping by <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata,</b> diagenetic caps, drape folds, and facies architecture, make the study areas attractive for exploration drilling. Some of the exploration targets were viewed as prospective in the past as at Vera and Unity in western Saskatchewan.

5000|$|DNAPLs {{that are}} not viscous, such as {{chlorinated}} solvents, tend to sink into aquifer materials below the water table and become {{much more difficult to}} locate and remediate than non aqueous phase liquids that are lighter than water (LNAPLs) which tend to float at the water table when spilled into natural soils. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has focused considerable attention on the remediation of DNAPL which can be costly. Removal or in situ destruction of DNAPLs eliminates the potential exposure to the compounds in the environment and can be an effective method for remediation; however, at some DNAPL sites remediation of DNAPL may not be practicable, and containment may be the only viable remedial action. The USEPA has a program to address sites where DNAPL removal is not practicable for remediation projects under CERCLA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery ActDense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), have low solubility and are with viscosity markedly lower and density higher than water-asphalt, heavy oils, lubricants and also chlorinated solvents-penetrate the full depth of the aquifer and accumulate on its bottom.

40|$|Hermit, Monument, Salt, and Horn Creeks {{flow through}} four side canyons of the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. They lie {{just west of}} Grand Canyon Village {{on the south side}} of the canyon. Each of these creeks is fed by at least one spring. Comparisons of flow at each of these springs for a 14 month period, and {{precipitation}} on the south rim show a close correlation. The lag period between recharge at the rim and discharge at the springs is less than one month for Hermit Creek and between one and two months for the other three creeks. The relative lag times and water chemistry of the springs indicate the length of the flow path to each spring. These suggest a dual source within the area of study. Two large faults lie in or near the area of study. These are the Hermit Fault, which lies near Hermit Creek, and the Bright Angel Fault, which likes just east of Horn Creek. Both faults trend in a general northeast direction and are accompanied by a wide fracture zone. Ground water flow in the area of study is largely controlled by these faults which seem to act as hydrologic collector structures and allow the water to move downward from the rim through the <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> below. The flow at each spring is a combination of water from two ground water systems. These ground water systems are controlled by the major faults. The water flows through fractures to each spring. The result is a structurally-controlled, interconnected flow system dominating the entire area of study...|$|R

40|$|Systematic soil-gas {{surveys were}} carried out in Northamptonshire to {{investigate}} the distribution of radon and its controlling factors. This followed reports in 1988 of indoor radon levels in the county exceeding the Action Level of 200 Bq m- 3. Over 3300 observations were made using a soil-gas emanometer in traverses crossing all geological formations. Over each formation results {{were found to be}} log-normally distributed, falling within 95 % Confidence Limits. The results are compared with 1026 indoor measurements provided by local authorities. Direct comparisons cannot be made due to different controlling factors; the concentration of radon in soil-gas is determined by the permeability of the source rock and overlying soil and by climate and weather, particularly temperature and wind run. Indoor radon is also affected {{by the nature of the}} house construction, particularly the floor, and heating and ventilation. Both sets of observations show that radon occurrence is primarily controlled by the underlying geology; the relationship is presented as a Radon Hazard Map for Northamptonshire. The highest soil-gas radon levels occur over the Northampton Sand Formation where indoor levels reach 1600 Bq m- 3, clearly presenting an elevated health hazard. The Marlstone Rock Bed, Upper Lincolnshire Limestone and Glacial gravels are also an elevated hazard. Hazard groups are defined as elevated on permeable strata where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 11 Bq L- 1 or over; moderate where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on permeable strata, or 11 Bq L- 1 or over on impermeable strata; slight where soil- gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less on permeable strata, or 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on impermeable strata; and low on <b>impermeable</b> <b>strata</b> where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less.

Structural exposure of these deposits led to the oxidation of methane and hydrogen and enrichment by carbon dioxide. European deposits were not structurally exposed to the oxidation process, but were exposed during salt rock formation. They experienced influx of heavy hydrocarbons from the underlying strata. The history of the formation of gas regime at the Verkhnekamskoe potash deposit could be divided into three stages. First stage may be characterized by a syngenetic capture of deep gases and authigenic organic matter converted during diagenesis to methane, which percentage gradually increases with an increase of the thickness of <b>impermeable</b> salt <b>strata.</b> Then the deep gases invaded the salt formation during sedimentation of the upper carnallite layers and top salt rock.
