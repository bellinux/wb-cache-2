As {{a part of the}} development process, the NASA- 300 M, a 20 -kW Hall thruster, was modified to incorporate the magnetic shielding concept and named the NASA- 300 MS. This activity was undertaken to assess the viability of using the magnetic shielding concept on a high-power Hall thruster to greatly reduce discharge channel erosion.

By contrast, tiling microarrays (TMA) have a much higher probe density and provide unbiased genome-wide coverage.

40|$|Building discriminative {{representations}} for 3 D {{data has}} been an important task in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2 D images with great success for a variety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3 D (3 DCNNs) seems like a plausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of 3 D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, since most 3 D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do not increase proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting in wasted computation. In this work, we represent 3 D spaces as volumetric fields, and propose a novel design that employs field <b>probing</b> <b>filters</b> to efficiently extract features from them. Each field <b>probing</b> <b>filter</b> is a set of probing points [...] - sensors that perceive the space.

40|$|We {{identified}} three splicing patterns used to excise the small intron {{common to all}} three transcripts encoded by minute virus of mice. Sequence analysis of minute virus of mice-specific cDNAs indicated that two donor and two acceptor splice sites were used: in pattern 1, the most frequent, nucleotide 2280 was spliced to nucleotide 2377; in pattern 2, nucleotides 2317 and 2399 were joined. Oligonucleotide probes, each specific {{for one of the}} four possible splice junction sequences, were synthesized and hybridized to viral mRNAs immobilized on nitrocellulose <b>filters.</b> The <b>probes</b> specific for splice patterns 1 and 2 hybridized to all three viral mRNAs, as did a third oligomer specific for a splicing pattern in which nucleotides 2280 and 2399 were joined. The fourth potential splicing pattern, linking nucleotides 2317 and 2377, was not detected. The presence of three splicing patterns in the transcripts designated R 2 and R 3 would allow the translation of five distinct polypeptides from these two mRNAs...|$|R
