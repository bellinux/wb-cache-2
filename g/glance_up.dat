60|$|Dane nodded, and {{the girl}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and down the lane suspiciously.|$|R
60|$|Lucy threw another <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> the dale and {{her heart}} beat. An indistinct row of small dark objects moved along the path, with two tall figures behind.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} other. He cast an uneasy <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> {{and down the}} street. [...] "I will meet you again, signorini," [...] he added. [...] "Which is your hotel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, {{with his}} hand on the cab apron, and a sudden <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> at the windows of his flat, [...] "I ought to tell my cousin Jane--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Light air, west-sou'-west," [...] muttered the Captain as {{he stepped}} on deck, cast a <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> at the vane on the mast-head, and then swept his eye round the (imaginary) horizon.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Kingdom, with a {{resigned}} expression, {{tried to}} catch her niece's eye and caught the captain's instead. Miss Nugent happening to <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> saw her fascinated by the basilisk glare of {{the master of the}} house.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{carriage}} is at {{his door}} now," [...] said I. [...] "There he is stepping into it. I saw him <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> at our window as he did so. Suppose I try my luck upon the bicycle?" ...|$|E
