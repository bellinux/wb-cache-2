50|$|Lloyd was {{determined}} to publish a newspaper {{so he decided to}} pay the duty. Breaking even financially was the real challenge: revenues net of stamp duty failed {{to cover the cost of}} the illustrations (stamp duty was more than the 1d duty on news because of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> on <b>paper</b> - 1½d per pound in weight). After another seven issues, Lloyd dropped all pictures and changed the name to Lloyd’s Weekly London Newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the duty}} on news {{was the most}} invidious “tax on knowledge”, the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> on <b>paper</b> had a malign effect on {{newspaper}} economics. The Fourdrinier process produced paper on a continuous reel. The efficiency of [...] "web printing" [...] that this promised was thwarted by the Stamp Office’s insistence on stamping the paper in sheet form. Although this was good for print-room workers, the advantages for Fleet Street were delayed by 50 years.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Routing {{algorithm}} {{is a challenge}} for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), but current routing protocols for MANET consider the path with minimum number of hops as the optimal path to a given destination. This strategy does not balance the traffic load over a MANET, and may result in some disadvantages such as creating congested area, depleting power faster and enlarging time delay in the nodes with <b>heavy</b> <b>duties.</b> In this <b>paper</b> we proposed routing metric can reflect not only the load of the path, but also the load distribution along the path. Simulation results show effectiveness of the routing scheme on balancing the load over all nodes in the network. Index Terms—Ad hoc, Load balance, Thershold valu...|$|R
40|$|The work deals {{about the}} design of a {{pneumatic}} rotating servomotor intended for low speed, high torque operation. The servosystem is based on a pneumatic orbital motor working in the 0 - 80 rpm range with a maximum torque of 28 Nm, and hence it can be applied in <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> application. The <b>paper</b> analyses the kinematic layout of the motor, shows the results of characterisation tests and finally it discusses the layout and the components to implement closed loop velocity control. The effectiveness of control layout based on the use of pressure proportional and flow proportional valves is compared by experimental tests. The results show the capabilityof the servosystem to keep the set velocity and to react to external disturbanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a three-phase induction motor from a single-phase supply with a capacitor in circuit is well known. While detailed investigations {{on the performance of}} the induction motor under such operating conditions are well reported in the literature, no such work is reported for the synchronous motor. The fine-start permanent-magnet synchronous motor (LSPMSM) is actively being considered as an energy efficient alternative to the induction motor in general purpose, <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> applications. The <b>paper</b> presents an analytical and experimental evaluation on the performance of a three-phase LSPMSM fed from a single-phase supply. This analysis is carried out using symmetrical component theory. A capacitor is connected across two stator phases during starting and running. Estimation of the capacitor value to achieve the desired objectives, such as minimum unbalance, maximum power factor, maximum torque or maximum efficiency, is carried out. Load tests are conducted to validate the simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Mobile robots have {{received}} {{a great deal of}} research in recent years. A significant amount of research has been published in many aspects related to mobile robots. Most of the research is devoted to design and develop some control techniques for robot motion and path planning. A large number of researchers have used kinematic models to develop motion control strategy for mobile robots. Their argument and assumption that these models are valid if the robot has low speed, low acceleration and light load. However, dynamic modelling of mobile robots is very important as they are designed to travel at higher speed and perform <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> work. This <b>paper</b> presents and discusses a new approach to develop a dynamic model and control strategy for wheeled mobile robot which I modelled as a rigid body that roles on two wheels and a castor. The motion control strategy consists of two levels. The first level is dealing with the dynamic of the system and denoted as `Low' level controller. The second level is developed to take care of path planning and trajectory generation...|$|R

While on the hunt for his cousin, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> handcuffs himself to Roadblock. He drags Roadblock into his vehicle which leads them into a car chase until Major Bludd blows up the bridge. Due to Major Bludd firing his laser onto the car as it was sinking, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> loses the keys to his handcuffs. But manages to pull himself and Roadblock out of the river, however they end up in the swamp while evading alligators. Luckily, Roadblock was able to fight off the alligator by wrestling it much to the surprise of <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty.</b> Major Bludd then attacks them in a swamp boat as Roadblock saves <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> from a large snake. After a brief fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them. While Major Bludd prepares a trap for the others, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> work to get out of the handcuffs. At the same time, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> realizes that his cousin was telling the truth when Bludd confirms that he's freelancing with Cobra.

40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars, adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R
