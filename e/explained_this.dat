5|$|The {{subject matter}} of the third letter {{is similar to that of}} the second letter, and some {{scholars}} have <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game {{do not reflect the}} genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
25|$|Inalienable {{possession}} constructions {{often lack}} overt possessors. There is debate {{as to how}} to account for this cross-linguistic universal difference in form. Iconicity <b>explains</b> <b>this</b> in terms {{of the relationship between the}} conceptual distance between the possessor and possessee, while economy <b>explains</b> <b>this</b> through frequency of possession.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> {{by saying that the}} old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release in Japanese arcades, {{reception}} was mixed. Treasure staff <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> {{was due to}} players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, Ikaruga was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began to grow a cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics {{as well as the}} art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. Ikaruga was later ported to the Xbox 360 as well as Microsoft Windows. In retrospect, Ikaruga is often {{regarded as one of the}} best shoot 'em ups of all time and one of Treasure's greatest works.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Under new Ajax manager Henk ten Cate, Charisteas was the 5th striker behind Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ryan Babel, Markus Rosenberg, and Rydell Poepon.

25|$|A {{number of}} events {{reported}} low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales. Preliminary competition and locally less popular sports failed to attract capacity crowd as expected.

25|$|The U.S. modernist poets were {{concerned}} to create {{work in a}} distinctively American idiom. Williams, a doctor who worked in general practice in a working-class area of Rutherford, New Jersey, <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> approach by saying that he made his poems from 'the speech of Polish mothers'. In this, they were placing themselves in a tradition stretching back to Whitman.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien {{describes}} Gollum {{as either}} dark, bone-white or sallow; {{at one point}} the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a tailless black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien <b>explained</b> <b>this</b> by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo's miscue {{on their}} final drive was {{particularly}} noteworthy {{in that it}} came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual.
