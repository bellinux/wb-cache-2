5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine-style {{establishment}} {{may have}} existed {{as early as}} the 8th century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> existed by the early 13th century.|$|E
25|$|On 24 February 2012, {{the court}} {{heard from a}} {{forensic}} imagery expert, Jacqueline Butterwick, who had analysed footage on behalf of police. She told the court that the CCTV footage of a person on Thistle Street bore enough similarities to other CCTV images of Suzanne Pilley taken that day, {{for her to say}} that <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> was Ms Pilley. She was 20 metres from the entrance to her work.|$|E

25|$|A {{person does}} not have to have each of these, but if {{something}} has all five then <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> is a person whether it is biologically human or not, while if it has none or perhaps only one then it is not a person, again whether it is biologically human or not. The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{encodings}} {{have only}} a limited repertoire of characters, they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode {{is an attempt to}} create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> isn't UTF-8.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that as a {{consequence}} of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Alex Henderson stating, [...] "McPherson's Mood isn't {{the least bit}} {{innovative}} (by 1969 standards), but <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> solid and enjoyable".|$|R
5000|$|Their newest album Abundance was {{released}} January 20, 2009. [...] Wajeed stated: [...] "...our tastes have changed—times have changed. <b>It’s</b> <b>definitely</b> a different record, {{but there are}} still a lot of similarities." ...|$|R
25|$|The Satan's bolete {{is found}} in the entire {{temperate}} zone, but in Europe <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> occurs more in southern regions. It is only found in the south of England. It is rare in Scandinavia, occurring primarily on a few islands in the Baltic Sea where the conditions are perfect, with highly calcareous (chalky) soil. It has been recorded in the Black Sea and eastern Anatolia regions of Turkey. as well as the Bar'am Forest in the Upper Galilee in northern Israel. Also, it has been recorded from Iran. It has been recorded from coastal areas of California, with a possible record from the southeastern US, however these sightings are of the closely related species Rubroboletus eastwoodiae. It grows in hardwood forests, mainly under beech (Fagus). It appears in summer {{and the beginning of the}} autumn in the southernmost areas. It is rather rare in the north, as it grows only in hot and sunny periods. It fruits in autumn.|$|E
500|$|Aside from recording, Knowles {{occasionally}} paints as her hobby: [...] "I {{think that}} painting, for me, {{is such an}} affirmative expression in that sometimes you don't know what the outcome is gonna be and each stroke and each brush for me is an emotion and, in the end, it comes out as a piece {{which is the most}} amazing thing.... <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> provides a different outlet." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, James Valentine {{said the}} band was in the studio {{recording}} songs for the upcoming fifth studio album: [...] "The stuff we're working on now, <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> has gone maybe a little darker in its sound, maybe {{back a little bit}} more to what we kind of did on Songs About Jane, but at this point we do have all kinds of different songs and it is early".|$|E
50|$|It's very exciting. <b>It's</b> <b>definitely</b> {{going to}} be a {{reflection}} of what Lotus means to me. If you take that album cover and give it a little performance twist, I'll bring that album cover to life, so it's {{going to be}} really fun. I can't give too much away about the songs, but <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deep - rooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|R

5000|$|... a bit {{darker and}} maybe not so complex as 2007's [...] "Unia". Nevertheless, <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> not a back-to-the-roots album with fast power metal. All the {{trademark}} SONATA stuff is on there, solos, lots of singing andsome slower songs.|$|R
500|$|Chris Robinson {{granted that}} the {{experience}} of playing Led Zeppelin songs with Jimmy Page influenced Lions, but not on a song-by-song basis. [...] "Led Zeppelin's music is very dramatic and very dynamic. [...] That's something we've attempted to do with our style also. I think <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> affected how we make our music." [...] Funk and R were bigger influences than on past albums, and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] was influenced by Nick Drake.|$|E
500|$|GamesRadar criticized Guilty Gear Xs [...] "overblown aesthetics", {{giving it}} the game's worst score (three out of ten): [...] "While it's not {{completely}} hellish, <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> deserves purgatory." [...] According to Star Dingo of GamePro, [...] "Most backgrounds seem like pale, watercolor imitations of the originals (you can count the colors on two hands)". Justin of Game Informer and Kaiser Hwang of IGN criticized the game's sprites, which they considered small {{compared with those of}} [...]|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} a {{favorite}} of both creator Carter, who calls it his favorite episode of the first season and actress Gillian Anderson. Co-writer Morgan also praises it as a script he is proud of. Director Nutter says of the episode, [...] "I think it's the most accomplished piece of directing of actors I've been able to do ... I think this episode really made a difference in how the audience looks at Scully. I think it brought a lot of dimension to her character and for her person <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> had a lot of impact." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Sami {{absolutely}} nailed these characters... Very cleverly layered. Its a {{very good}} mix of comedy and tragedy. I'm disappointed its a 6 episode season and we're halfway through. <b>Its</b> <b>definitely</b> definitely worth watching." [...] - Sarah McMullan, National Radio ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the movie}} started filming, the media {{reported}} that Blonde Ambition was {{a remake of}} the 1980s film Working Girl. After Simpson learned about this rumor, she talked to Empire Online and stated, [...] "I don't know where that came from", [...] "it's a movie called Blonde Ambition co-starring Luke Wilson. <b>It's</b> <b>definitely</b> the theme of Working Girl - this small town girl that moves to New York City to rise up into this great career as a business woman pretty much. But <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> not a remake." [...] Simpson also said that this film {{is more of a}} knockabout comedy than the Melanie Griffith starrer, which was a drama genre movie.|$|R
5000|$|... "If you're a Dio Fan, you'll {{enjoy the}} videos as <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> a good {{span of the}} band's music through the years," [...] wrote Matt Beaman in the Black Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. [...] "If you're not, then you'll {{probably}} end up moaning about 'that bloody dragon'!" ...|$|R
500|$|Music {{magazine}} Spin included [...] "In the Dark" [...] {{at number}} 15 on its [...] "Favorite Pop Tracks of 2011" [...] list, naming it [...] "radio gold". The Hollywood Reporter music editor Shirley Halperin {{put it at}} number four on her [...] "Top 10 Singles of 2011" [...] list and called it [...] "irresistible". Halperin went on to comment: [...] "Spotlighting the sexiest sax solo this side of Duran Duran's 'Rio' and a sultry, almost Latin-flavored vibe, {{it may or may}} not be an ode to masturbation, but <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> satisfies in all the right places." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{shooting}} of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, [...] "I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days." [...] Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. [...] "It took about {{a year to get}} back to a place that felt semi-normal," [...] he said; [...] "I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd never do it again; <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> gave me some problems." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Isaac Rentz. When shooting the music video, Jeremy Davis stated [...] "I've realized you can't really consider it making a music video unless you get hurt, because every video, we end up in pain ... It's awesome to do our own stunts; {{we might as well}} be Jackie Chan." [...] Taylor York adds [...] "A lot of people would hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love, but what was so appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ... He had so many ideas, and <b>it</b> <b>definitely</b> jumped out at us." ...|$|E
5000|$|GamePro {{gave the}} arcade version a rave review, praising {{the ability to}} choose from {{multiple}} paths, the numerous secret items, the sharp graphics, and the Aerosmith soundtrack.

5000|$|... “I got {{a chance}} to really be {{involved}} in the studio writing tracks and lyrics, everything.

5000|$|In {{an issue}} of Vrij Nederland, Dutch critic and writer Arnon Grunberg called the book good, but the movie better, saying [...] "Gone Baby Gone {{might not be a}} perfect film, but <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> an {{important}} one, if only to raise the question: 'What is home?'" ...|$|R
500|$|The Bengals traded Walters {{and quarterback}} Wayne Clark to the Philadelphia Eagles in {{exchange}} for quarterback John Reaves and a 1976 second-round draft pick (which was used on guard Glenn Bujnoch) on July 3, 1975. Walters considered a meeting with head coach Dick Vermeil before the 1976 season as the critical moment in his playing career. Vermeil, {{who had just been}} hired by the Eagles, told Walters that if he did not start playing better he would be released. Walters said, [...] "It shook me up. <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> made a difference." [...] He started in every game from 1975 through 1982 at left tackle. Harvey Martin, a defensive end who played for the Dallas Cowboys and frequently played against Walters, called Walters the smartest offensive tackle in the league during his career.|$|E
500|$|For playing Aurora Lane in {{the science}} fiction film Passengers (2016), Lawrence was paid $20 million and {{received}} top-billing over co-star Chris Pratt. It features Pratt and her as two people who wake up 90 years too soon from an induced hibernation on a spaceship bound for a new planet. Critical reaction was negative, with a consensus that the film had a [...] "fatally flawed story", though the chemistry between Lawrence and Pratt was praised. Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian believed that [...] "Lawrence is no passenger. She's carrying this thing", but Kwame Opam of The Verge considered her character to be of minimal importance. Responding to the criticism of the film, Lawrence said, [...] "I thought the script was beautiful—it was this tainted, complicated love story. <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> wasn't a failure". By March 2017, Lawrence's films had grossed over $5.5 billion worldwide.|$|E
500|$|After the tour, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich, who, {{according}} to Yorke, [...] "gave us a walloping kick up the arse". In October 2006, recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. <b>It</b> <b>definitely</b> had an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes." [...] The sessions were productive, and the band recorded [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] and [...] "Bodysnatchers". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had [...] "started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think. Finally." ...|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the reviews}} for Golf Resort Tycoon {{stated that it}} was a mediocre game overall. GameSpot gave it a 6.2, stating [...] "Golf Resort Tycoon can be a nice {{diversion}} and a decent way to kill time in short spurts, but <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> not for everyone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... It {{really has}} to be {{experienced}} to be understood, but <b>it's</b> <b>definitely</b> not for everyone. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not {{at least a little}} crazy. But for me, skishing is to surfcasting, as a hurricane is to a windy day.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Gordhan reacted {{to the success of}} the single: [...] "I'm over the moon! It's amazing to know that there's a lot of love for this record. It's a special track and I'm grateful to everyone for supporting <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>definitely</b> made me 'smile'!" ...|$|R
