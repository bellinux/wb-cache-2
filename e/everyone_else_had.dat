5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of Manche Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, and the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch'ol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in Cobán.|$|E

Early {{in the morning of}} 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, surrendered with his staff at 06:00. Down in the Führerbunker, Chief of the Army General Staff General Hans Krebs and Hitler's Chief Adjutant Generalleutnant Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker; the clear mark of cyanide appeared on their faces.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 the Soviet forces {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire.

The last defenders {{in the area of}} the bunker complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23.

25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Stephen Travers {{was seriously}} wounded by a dum-dum bullet which had struck {{him when the}} gunmen had first begun shooting. He survived by pretending he was dead, as he lay beside the body of McCoy. Saxophone player Des McAlea was hit by the minibus's door when it was blown off in the explosion, but was not badly wounded. He lay hidden in thick undergrowth, undetected by the gunmen. He also survived. However, the flames from the burning hedge (which had been set on fire by the explosion) soon came dangerously close to where he lay; {{he was forced to}} leave his hiding spot. By this time the gunmen had left the scene, {{assuming}} <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> been killed. Travers later recalled hearing one of the departing gunmen tell his comrade who had kicked McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} not alive: [...] "Come on, those bastards are dead. I got them with dum-dums". McAlea made his way up the embankment to the main road where he hitched a lift to alert the RUC at their barracks in Newry.|$|E
500|$|At 17:40, West Bridges engine {{broke down}} {{once again and}} her crew was unable to repair it.

On West Bridge, Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. Noma sailed back to West Bridge, ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, [...] approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold {{in the front of the}} ship, while the second hit amidships near the engine room. West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. He and two crewmen remained behind until they felt sure that <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> departed.

500|$|The U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of {{its annual}} Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971. Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located [...] "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award) by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Grammy Award organization. Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were {{released}} in 1971, as many as had come out over the previous eight years. Best received by critics was Elvis Country, a concept record that focused on genre standards. The biggest seller was Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas, [...] "the truest statement of all", according to Greil Marcus. [...] "In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of 'Merry Christmas Baby,' a raunchy old Charles Brown blues." [...] According to Guralnick, [...] "the one real highlight" [...] {{of one of the}} 1971 sessions were the recording of [...] "I Will Be True," [...] "It's Still Here," [...] and [...] "I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen," [...] a trio of songs that Presley recorded in a rare solo set, sitting at the piano after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> gone home: [...] "Yearning, wistfulness, loneliness, need—all were communicated with a naked lack of adornment that Elvis was seeming to find increasingly difficult to display in the formal process of recording." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 19, {{the trek}} {{continued}} to Terijoki. Once the deportees had arrived, and after trudging through a heavy snowstorm, a parlay was conducted under white flags of truce between Berkman, guarded by the Finns, and the Russians, {{out on the}} ice of the frozen Systerbak River, which separated the Finnish and Bolshevist lines. Things being settled, the [...] "undesirables" [...] then crossed over into Russia at 2 pm, Berkman and Goldman waiting until <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> safely crossed.

The Daleks end up being the last of the Doctor's enemies to besiege Trenzalore as <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> either retreated or been destroyed. The Daleks nearly finish the Eleventh Doctor, now a frail old man with no regenerations left, once and for all on Trenzalore as history dictated. However, due to the pleas of Clara Oswald, the Time Lords intervene, granting the Doctor a new regeneration cycle.

But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> just been a jobber, leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes.

There was not a word to show that Mrs. Bolton had herself accepted the decision to which <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> come in the matter;--everything, rather, to show that she had not done so. But, as the squire said, it does not do to inquire too closely into all people's inner beliefs. 'If everybody were to say what he thinks about everybody, nobody would ever go to see anybody.' It was soon decided that Hester, with her baby, should go on an early day to Puritan Grange, and should stay there for a couple of nights. But there was a difficulty as to Caldigate himself. He was naturally enough anxious to send Hester without him, but she was as anxious to take him. 'It isn't for my own sake,' she said,--'because I shall like to have you there with me.
