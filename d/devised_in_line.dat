In the paper an attempt is made to identify policies; especially with regard to Agriculture sector, as it is the back bone of the livelihood of the people more than 85 percent in Ethiopia. Due to this reason, every development policy in the country is <b>devised</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with this sector so that technology transfer is possible from agriculture to industry. This is why the government of Ethiopia is following a policy known as ADLI, agricultural development lead industrialization. Sinc...|$|E
40|$|In a two-agent {{society with}} partially-honest agents, we extend Dutta and Sen (2009) 's results of Nash {{implementation}} to {{the domain of}} weak orders. We identify the class of Nash implementable social choice correspondences with a "gap" between necessary and sufficient conditions, both when exactly one agent is partially-honest and when both agents are partially-honest. We also show that, on the domain of linear orders, the "gap" between our conditions gets closed and they become equivalent to those devised by Dutta and Sen. New implementing mechanisms are <b>devised.</b> <b>In</b> <b>line</b> with earlier works, the classic condition of monotonicity is no longer required, whereas a weak version of the standard punishment condition is required even when both agents {{are known to be}} partially-honest. We derive simpler sufficient conditions that are satisfied {{in a wide range of}} applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{case study}} {{describes}} pollution of the Lincolnshire Limestone aquifer, pre-dominantly by the herbicide Mecoprop, {{to the north}} of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Key features of the case study are the occurrence of a series of former landfill sites located on the Lincolnshire Limestone aquifer outcrop, a nearby groundwater abstraction for public supply within the confined aquifer and the presence of a major geological fault and its associated control on groundwater movement. At the time of licensing, the fault was considered to hydraulically isolate the landfill sites from the abstraction. A multiphase investigation, begun in 1990, was conducted by the National Rivers Authority and involved close liaison with the Cambridgeshire County Council, landowners, site operators and the Anglian Water Company. Investigations have focused n id ntifying and proving the source of pollution and determining its severity and extent. Remedial strategies and the implications of future change in hydraulic conditions have alsobeen considered. A medium-term risk management strategy for the area has been <b>devised.</b> This is <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the UK Government's principles for contaminated land management. This paper describes the study of a pollutio...|$|R
