40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the age, sex, and cause specific prevalences of blindness and visual impairment in adults 30 {{years of age}} and older in Bangladesh. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 12 782 adults 30 {{years of age and}} older was selected based on multistage, cluster random sampling with probability proportional to size procedures. The breakdown of the cluster sites was proportional to the rural/urban distribution of the national population. The examination protocol consisted of an interview, visual acuity (VA) testing, autorefraction, and optic disc examination on all subjects. Corrected VA retesting, cataract grading, and a dilated fundal examination were performed on all visually impaired subjects. The definitions of blindness ( 3 / 60) were based on the presenting visual acuity in the better eye. The World Health Organization/Prevention of Blindness proforma and its classification sys-tem for identifying the main cause of <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and blindness for each examined subject was used. Results: In total, 11 624 eligible subjects were examined (90. 9 % response rate) across the 154 clus-ter sites.

The school added the [...] "and Visually Impaired" [...] to its name in 2007 and continues to use it today, despite [...] "students {{who are blind or}} have low vision" [...] being the currently accepted term. Students are able to attend the school from pre-school to high school, up to age 22. The current student population is estimated between 150 and 175 students; there are also an equal number of educators, maintenance, outreach, administrators and residential staff. The current superintendent of ISBVI, James Durst, does not actually hold valid Indiana licensure to be a superintendent [...] and is therefore officially the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the school instead. The Lions Clubs of Indiana support the institution as one of their state projects through monetary donations and volunteerism. ISBVI has a youth Lions Club called the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Leo Club. Their colors are green and white. Their mascot is the rocket. They play sports as swimming, cheerleading, forensics, wrestling, goalball, track and field.|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to explore how {{people who are blind}} or <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> prefer to get online news, the problems they face in doing so and how their online news-gathering experiences could be made better. It also investigates whether they believe they experience a gap in their knowledge of news {{as a result of their}} level of news access. Using semi-structured interviews and observation sessions with 14 mid-Missouri residents who are blind or <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> the researcher discovered that many do not regularly use traditional news websites, often because of accessibility or usability problems. Instead, they tend to get news through other online and offline platforms. Subjects overall said they do not think they experience a knowledge gap, although anecdotes and observations revealed some problems. The 14 interviews yielded a list of suggested improvements to online news delivery. These were supplemented with interviews with six professionals who offered more insight into those improvements. The population of people who are blind or <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> is not small, and the people interviewed for this study showed that they are generally an interested, engaged news audience. However, little research has been done on how to deliver news in ways that serve them best. This study seeks to begin to fill that gap...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present the}} {{findings}} from two Canada-wide studies involving post-secondary students who self-identified as either being totally blind (n = 29) or <b>having</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (n = 143). The first study examined the {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) used by students and how adequately these met their on and off campus needs, and the second study explored the accessibility of e-learning at the post-secondary level, including which e-learning tools participants find most and least accessible. The findings indicate that several e-learning tools, such as PDF documents and web-based content, pose a number of accessibility problems. Moreover, the results suggest that participants encounter problems when using ICTs at home and at school, such as ICTs not being adequately up-to-date. We present these findings and provide recommendations to address these concerns, such as the need to ensure that universal design and web-accessibility guidelines are considered when e-learning tools are implemented...|$|R
