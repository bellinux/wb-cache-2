He was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching {{a student in the}} Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E

Moving to the British Isles on business, he did however play {{for a number of}} clubs in Scotland and Ireland until after World War I, and played one final first class match for the Woodbrook Club against his old teammates in 1912.|$|E

Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.|$|E
25|$|Lucas {{was educated}} at Uppingham School and Clare College, Cambridge. Even as a seventeen-year-old, Lucas proved himself an {{exceptional}} batsman with an innings of 136 against MCC {{and in a}} review when Greville Stevens was picked as a schoolboy for the Gentlemen in 1919, was described as <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected himself. Lucas did play twice for Surrey and caused a sensation at Prince’s with an innings of 48 against Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley at their best.|$|E

25|$|His {{form was}} <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rewarded with his {{first-class}} debut {{at the end}} of the season. He played in a Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania. He opened the batting, scoring 40 runs in the first innings and 71 in the second. As South Australia won the match, they progressed to the final against Victoria, which Dalton also played in.

He chipped in 5 goals and 5 assists in 17 games during the playoffs before the Flyers lost in seven games to the New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
25|$|Wellard was a fast-bowling all-rounder who {{exemplified}} {{much of the}} happy-go-lucky cricket {{played by}} Somerset in the 1930s. Despite a first-class batting average of only 19.72, he was famous {{for the number of}} sixes he hit, with over 500 in his career, accounting for a quarter of his runs. He was for many years the holder of the record number of sixes in a single season, with 72 in 1935. But Wellard as a fast bowler was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> picked twice for England, against New Zealand in 1937 and against the Australians in 1938, and his 1,614 career wickets put him 63rd on the all-time bowling lists.|$|E

After an 0–4 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52–5 record over their next 57 games. They finished the regular season {{with a record of}} 67–15, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tied for 6th place all-time, first in the league and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season, and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team.|$|E
25|$|A {{roller coaster}} decade {{continued}} for the franchise as the 1987–88 season {{began with the}} team changing its name back to the Centennials. The hockey club also returned to their red, black, and white colour scheme. On the ice, the team's record improved by 15 wins and they finished {{with a record of}} 25–27–0. The point total of 50 was good enough for fourth in the Interior Division, just eight points behind the second place Kelowna Packers. Frank Biller, Al Rushton, and Cal McGowan led the team offensively. Biller posted 57 goals and 49 assists for 106 points, sixth overall in the BCJHL. Rushton chipped in with 87 points and McGowan ended up with 79 points, both <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amongst the top eight scorers in the Interior Division.

The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on 26 May. The next tour, in 1964, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6. In 1973 Rhodesia played a one-off match against Italy, winning 42 to 4. In 1970 Rhodesia played New Zealand {{for the last time}} on 27 July, losing 14 to 27. The final record against the All Blacks was an impressive Played 5, won 1 drawn 1 and lost 3. In 1974, the Lions were back at Salisbury where they defeated Rhodesia 42 to 6. The coming decades of the 1960s and 1970s saw a number of home-grown players considered <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected for South Africa. Rhodesia's rugby playing strength reached its peak in the early to mid-1970s seasons when the country possessed 49 clubs, putting together 102 teams.|$|E

According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising {{and if it was}} successful Bush was too young to handle it.
