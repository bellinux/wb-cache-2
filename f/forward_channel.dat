50|$|Even {{when the}} return and <b>forward</b> <b>channels</b> {{use the same}} medium, their {{differences}} often dictate the use of very different data modulation and coding techniques.

50|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> {{is divided}} into slots, each being 1.667 ms long. In {{addition}} to user traffic, overhead channels are interlaced into the stream. These include the Pilot which helps the mobile find and identify the channel, the Media Access Channel (MAC) which tells the mobiles when their data is scheduled, and the Control Channel, which contains other information that the network needs the mobiles to know.|$|E
50|$|In a data {{transmission}} circuit a backward channel is the channel that passes {{data in a}} direction opposite to that of its associated <b>forward</b> <b>channel.</b> The backward channel is usually used for transmission of request, supervisory, acknowledgement, or error-control signals. The direction of flow of these signals is opposite to that in which user information is being transferred. The backward-channel bandwidth is usually {{less than that of}} the primary channel, that is, the forward (user information) channel. For example, ADSL's upstream channel, considered a backward channel for some types of analysis, typically has a bandwidth less than one-fourth of the downstream channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{redundancy}} {{allows the}} receiver to detect {{a limited number of}} errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to correct these errors without retransmission. FEC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a reverse channel to request retransmission of data, but at the cost of a fixed, higher <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth. FEC is therefore applied in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting to multiple receivers in multicast. FEC information is usually added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data, and is widely used in modems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In a {{cellular}} network, {{if there are}} too many data users in a cell, data may suffer long delay, and system’s quality-of-service (QoS) will degrade. Some traditional schemes such as dynamic channel-allocation scheme (DCA) will assign more channels to hot (or overloaded) cells through a central control system (CC), and the throughput increase will be upper bounded by the number of new channels assigned to the cell. In mobile-assisted data forwarding (MADF), we add an ad-hoc overlay to the fixed cellular infrastructure and special channels–called <b>forwarding</b> <b>channels</b> – are used to connect mobile units in a hot cell and its surrounding cold cells without going through the hot cell’s base station. Thus, mobile units in a hot cell can forward data to other cold cells to achieve load balancing. Most of the forwardingchannel management work in MADF is done by mobile units themselves in order to relieve the load from the CC. The traffic increase in a certain cell will not be upper bounded by the number of <b>forwarding</b> <b>channels.</b> It can be more if the users in hot cell are significantly far away from one another, and these users can use the same <b>forwarding</b> <b>channels</b> to <b>forward</b> data to different cold neighboring cells without interference. We find that, in a system using MADF, under a certain delay requirement, the throughput in a certain cell or for the whole network can be greatly improved.

50|$|Other <b>forward</b> <b>channels,</b> {{selected}} by their Walsh code, carry {{data from the}} network to the mobiles. Data consists of network signaling and user traffic. Generally, {{data to be transmitted}} is divided into frames of bits. A frame of bits is passed through a convolutional encoder, adding forward error correction redundancy, generating a frame of symbols. These symbols are then spread with the Walsh and PN sequences and transmitted.|$|R
50|$|Return and <b>forward</b> <b>channels</b> are {{distinct}} from, {{and should not}} be confused with, uplinks and downlinks in satellite communication systems. For example, satellite internet access withconventional bent-pipe transponders require a total of two uplinks and two downlinks. One uplink and downlink pair are used for the forward link from the central ground hub through the satellite to the user terminal, and another uplink/downlink pair are used for the return link from the user terminal to the central hub.|$|R
5000|$|ReFLEX is a {{wireless}} protocol developed by Motorola, used for two-way paging, messaging, and low-bandwidth data. It {{is based on}} the FLEX one-way paging protocol, adding capabilities for multiple forward channels, multiple return channels, and roaming. It originally came in two variants, ReFLEX25 and ReFLEX50. ReFLEX50 was originally developed to support a messaging service launched by MTEL in the mid 1990s, while ReFLEX25 was developed several years later to provide an upgrade path for traditional one-way paging carriers. [...] The 50 and 25 signified 50 KHz and 25KHz channel spacing, although in reality both variants supported flexible channel configurations. The two variants were unified into a single protocol with version 2.7, which was released simply as ReFLEX 2.7. Devices compliant with ReFLEX 2.7 are backwards compatible with both ReFLEX25 and ReFLEX50 networks, with several new features to improve roaming, performance, and interoperability between different networks. ReFLEX systems support <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> speeds of 1600, 3200, and 6400 bits per second, and return channel speeds of 800, 1600, 6400, and 9600 bits per second.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a relay network {{with a single}} source-des-tination pair and multiple layers of relays between them. We as-sume that these layers sequentially relay the signal transmitted by the source to the destination. Unlike existing work, we also assume that the destination and all the forward layers present between the transmitting layer and the destination receive signals during every transmission phase. We optimally combine these signals, say of them, using a precoder at each relay layer for onward transmis-sion. We obtain this precoding matrix by minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) at the relays, and do not require channel-state-information (CSI) of the <b>forward</b> <b>channels</b> at the relays unlike existing systems that minimize MSE at the destination and require CSI of the <b>forward</b> <b>channels</b> at the relays. Our closed-form solution for this matrix is valid {{for any number of}} layers, whereas mini-mizing MSE at the destination does not have closed-form solution for. For, we enhance an existing scheme to obtain a sub-optimal closed-form precoder solution and use it for com-parison. We show using simulations that our scheme approaches the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of this scheme, when is in-creased, even with partial CSI.

40|$|We present simple coding strategies, {{which are}} {{variants}} of the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme, for communicating reliably over additive white noise channels {{in the presence}} of corrupted feedback. More specifically, we consider a framework comprising an additive white <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> and a backward link which is used for feedback. We consider two types of corruption mechanisms in the backward link. The first is quantization noise, i. e., the encoder receives the quantized values of the past outputs of the <b>forward</b> <b>channel.</b> The quantization is uniform, memoryless and time invariant (that is, symbol-by-symbol scalar quantization), with bounded quantization error. The second corruption mechanism is an arbitrarily distributed additive bounded noise in the backward link. Here we allow symbol-by-symbol encoding at the input to the backward channel. We propose simple explicit schemes that guarantee positive information rate, in bits per channel use, with positive error exponent. If the <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> is additive white Gaussian then our schemes achieve capacity, in the limit of diminishing amplitude of the noise components at the backward link, while guaranteeing that the probability of error converges to zero as a doubly exponential function of the block length. Furthermore, if the <b>forward</b> <b>channel</b> is additive white Gaussian and the backward link consists of an additive bounded noise channel, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained symbol-by-symbol encoding, then our schemes are also capacity-achieving in the limit of high SNR...|$|E

By this reason, CDMA communication has a possibility of being eavesdropped by someone. It is known that eavesdropping in CDMA system is impossible because the voice data spreads with the PN.
