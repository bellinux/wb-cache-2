Against this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> by Arrian that an ala was 512 strong. This would make an ala turma 32 men strong.|$|E
5|$|The play <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> on {{the idea}} that a man is valued by his {{position}} in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, an {{equation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> of an equality containing {{one or more}} variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. Variables are also called unknowns and {{the values of the}} unknowns which satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.|$|E
25|$|In United States {{business}} law, a forward-looking statement or {{safe harbor}} statement <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> that cannot sustain itself {{as merely a}} historical fact. A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, {{as they can be}} mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to United States Code 15 Section 78u-5, a forward-looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.|$|E

Among Bower's many interpolations is a passage that directly refers to Robin. It is inserted after Fordun's {{account of the}} defeat of Simon de Montfort and the punishment of his adherents. Robin is represented as a fighter for de Montfort's cause. This was in fact true of the historical outlaw of Sherwood Forest Roger Godberd, whose points of similarity to the Robin Hood of the ballads have often been noted.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a theorem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> {{that has}} been proved {{on the basis of}} {{previously}} established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> of {{the anatomical}} features of an organism (or group) that collectively {{distinguish it from}} all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Sereno et al. (1993), Eoraptor can be distinguished {{based on the fact}} that its premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are leaf-shaped, the external nares are slightly enlarged, and the premaxilla is observed to have a slender posterolateral process. Max Langer and Michael Benton (2006) noted that Eoraptor can be distinguished {{based on the fact that}} the proximal part of its fibula is extremely transversely compressed.|$|E
