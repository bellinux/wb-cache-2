5|$|Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time.... I don't go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get back to work.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fire {{hundreds}} of bullets. Most Muslim countries impose hanging for civilians arming themselves for conflict. There {{are not many}} {{countries in the world}} where a tourist, according to his visa, can go to stay with the army and shoot across the border at its enemy, legally.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> see the world. I {{used to think that}} World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
25|$|This is Richard's CD. My only {{knowledge}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the studio}} {{was how he}} seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E

No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f <b>I's</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; <b>I</b> hain' <b>got</b> no use f'r um, skasely." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{supported}} the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. [...] Although {{he belonged to}} a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, [...] "It was only after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Detroit that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know Negroes and began {{to be able to}} evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." [...] During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that [...] "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." [...] Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.|$|E
5000|$|In {{constant}} {{contact with the}} natives, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> the idea of living completely amongst them.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I?" [...] she says. [...] "It's a life interest. As long as <b>I</b> live I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have it, {{and as long}} as <b>I</b> live I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{remain the}} Marchioness of Appleford." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> go. With an ironical {{gesture of}} remonstrance, she signed {{to me to}} sit down again.|$|R
500|$|It's happened. At last. I've hit the Holy Grail of {{animation}} gigs. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be a character on ... tan-tara ... SpongeBob SquarePants. Oh Yeah!! We, the family, are thrilled. Nothing else need happen this year, well, this week anyway. My character {{in this special}} longform (I think a half hour special) show is called 'Lord Royal Highness'. Alrighteee!! ...|$|E
500|$|Fightstar {{have said}} that they are {{influenced}} by a variety of music (particularly film scores), citing Nirvana, Deftones, Radiohead, Silverchair, Pantera, Mono, Explosions in the Sky, Elliott Smith, The Cure and Jeff Buckley as inspirations. Abidi called Deftones the band with whom he would most like to perform: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play with (them), that'd be it, you could stick a fork in me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand, and I felt the bone flex. And when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the point where I {{felt like it was}} going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> 24 minutes <b>to</b> go.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> access <b>to</b> it {{with some}} difficulty; and, in looking for lines and flies, the long-lost {{manuscript}} presented itself.|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> {{all these}} matters, and took most things coolly, {{in the spirit}} of Seneca and the stoics.|$|R
500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be wild and crazy, and at the same time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E
500|$|It {{takes me}} back to being in my car as a teenager. It takes {{me back to}} when me and my husband first meet, and he tries to scoop me and he thinks I'm the hottest thing in the world. I kinda had this whole fantasy {{of being in the}} car, and this whole movie played in my head. I didn't have a pen and paper. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the mic, I'm like, 'Oh, press Record.' ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{reflected}} on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, My Turn. She described lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, [...] "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know you, I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'" [...] Reagan responded, [...] "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!" ...|$|E
60|$|It had clouded {{up pretty}} dark just after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> the raft, {{but it was}} {{clearing}} up again now.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I {{missed it}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> Claridge’s, and I thought I might {{possibly}} have dropped it here.|$|R
5000|$|... "When <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{see them}} live, I was {{transformed}} into a hysterical nine-year-old girl at a Beatles concert." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Vatos" [...] was {{directed}} by Johan Renck and written by Robert Kirkman; this episode became Kirkman's first writing credit for the series. [...] "I was pretty happy that the first death in the show was in an episode that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> write," [...] he stated. [...] "That was kind of cool." [...] The episode's script was heavily modified by Kirkman and series creator Frank Darabont prior to airing. Neil Brown, Jr. initially collaborated with producers on directing the episode but eventually {{pulled out of the}} project.|$|E
500|$|Back then I didn't {{realize the}} power of my character. [...] I didn't realize the image I had created and {{what it meant to}} so many people. [...] Ruth was so underwritten, so what I was able to bring to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bring that to her character, and that was all I thought there was. [...] I didn't know what was being {{received}} {{on the other side of}} the screen.|$|E
500|$|Music {{writers have}} {{described}} the instrumental's jazz elements and Murray questions whether Hendrix's approach was studied or more organic. [...] Bassist Jaco Pastorius felt that Hendrix's impact on jazz was obvious: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say is... 'Third Stone from the Sun'. [...] And for anyone who doesn't know about that by now , they should have checked Jimi out a lot earlier." [...] Shadwick feels that the freak-out sections may have inspired countless less-imaginative imitators. [...] In a song review for AllMusic, Unterberger saw {{the potential for a}} more fully realized piece: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{first thing}} I saw when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> {{the ship was}} Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.|$|R
