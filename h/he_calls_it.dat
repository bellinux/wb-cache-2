5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) of {{the body}} is {{dispersed}} within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E
5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E
25|$|The area {{downstream}} of the Volga, {{widely believed}} to have been a cradle of the Proto-Indo-European civilization, was settled by Huns and other Turkic peoples in the first millennium AD, replacing the Scythians. The ancient scholar Ptolemy of Alexandria mentions the lower Volga in his Geography (Book 5, Chapter 8, 2nd Map of Asia). <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> the Rha, which was the Scythian name for the river.

He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest members of our human family”.|$|E
25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of {{the most}} vivid {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> – {{as it was then}} very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of a family to die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large enough to stand in. While the physical Master Map as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E

Lutin is so taken with Fairyland that <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> Paradise and assumes he must be dead. The fairies explain the situation, and they all vie for his attention, saying that they prefer his rugged appearance to men that are handsome. Zayda persuades all the other fairies to find food for Lutin. When they have left, she tells him {{that all of the}} other fairies have faults, and that she is the only fairy worthy of his esteem. When the other fairies return, they ask Lutin if he has a wife. He replies that he is married down below, but is a bachelor in Fairyland, which offends Zayda.|$|E

500|$|Russell's view {{of human}} nature, like that of Thomas Hobbes, is {{somewhat}} pessimistic. By Russell's account, the desire to empower oneself is unique to human nature. No other animals besides Homo sapiens, he argues, are capable of being so unsatisfied with their lot, that they should try to accumulate more goods than meet their needs. The [...] "impulse to power", as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> does not arise unless one's basic desires have been sated. (Russell 1938:3) Then the imagination stirs, motivating the actor to gain more power. In Russell's view, the love of power is nearly universal among people, although it takes on different guises from person to person. A person with great ambitions may become the next Caesar, but others may be content to merely dominate the home. (Russell 1938:9) ...|$|E

500|$|After {{his early}} Symphony in C, Bizet's purely orchestral output is sparse. The Roma symphony over which he laboured {{for more than}} eight years compares poorly, in Dean's view, with its {{juvenile}} predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod and contains passages that recall Weber and Mendelssohn. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "misfire". Bizet's other mature orchestral work, the overture Patrie, is similarly dismissed: [...] "an awful warning {{of the danger of}} confusing art with patriotism". The musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived respectively from the piano work Jeux d'enfants and the incidental music for L'Arlésienne. In these, he demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.|$|E
500|$|The woodwind sonatas {{are among}} the composer's last works. Ratner writes of them, [...] "The spare, evocative, {{classical}} lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement." [...] Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata {{is the most important}} of the three: <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism" [...] amounting to [...] "a summary of the rest". The work contrasts a [...] "doleful threnody" [...] in the slow movement with the finale, which [...] "pirouettes in 4/4 time", in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata [...] "a model of transparency, vitality and lightness", containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation.|$|E

500|$|On its release, {{reviewer}} Anne Rubenstein praised Love and RocketsX {{for expanding}} the [...] "aesthetic possibilities of graphic narrative"; she recommended it {{as a starting}} point for new Love and Rockets readers daunted by the complexity of the earlier stories, and called it [...] "as essential as the rest of the Hernandez canon". [...] Comics critic R.Fiore placed Love and RocketsX 7th on his list of best English non-strip comics of the 1990s. [...] <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a comics equivalent of a Victor Hugo-style social novel" [...] and praises Hernandez for successfully interweaving so many of the quasi-isolated ethnic social milieus of Los Angeles into one narrative, though he found weakness in Hernandez's grasp of their various speech patterns and suggested actual South Americans would have been more appropriate to the real political background than the fictional Palomarians. [...] Reviewer Tom Knapp considered the work [...] "confusing" [...] and [...] "one of the low points" [...] in the Love and Rockets series.|$|E
500|$|David Bleiler is more {{positive}} about the film, writing in his TLA Video & DVD Guide that it [...] "isn't some third-rate, quick-paycheck hack job mystery which the advertising suggests."

Bleiler states that the cast are [...] "stellar", Ayola is [...] "radiant", and the revelatory scene between Angela and Gwendolyne is [...] "wonderful", asserting: [...] "Although slight, this is a perfect film for a nice, quiet evening at home". Alison Darren in her Lesbian Film Guide is also positive, asserting that: [...] "Great Moments in Aviation is a little gem of a British film". She describes the resolution of the lesbian storyline as [...] "a golden scene, beautifully photographed and exceptionally well paced", and asserts that [...] "For women of a certain age, this may be the most heart-rending (not to say, inspirational) depiction of a coming-out moment ever seen on screen.

While Brett's review is positive, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but {{that many of}} his stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince".
