2500|$|An {{electronic}} cigarette or <b>e-cigarette</b> is a handheld electronic device {{that tries to}} create the feeling of tobacco smoking. It works by heating a liquid to generate an aerosol, commonly called a [...] "vapor", that the user inhales. Using e-cigarettes is sometimes called vaping. The liquid in the <b>e-cigarette,</b> called e-liquid, is usually made of nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerine, and flavorings. Not all e-liquids contain nicotine.|$|E
5000|$|Everyday use {{is common}} among <b>e-cigarette</b> users. Vapers mostly keep smoking, {{although}} many say vaping helps them cut down or quit smoking. Many <b>e-cigarette</b> users are middle-aged men who also smoke traditional cigarettes, either {{to help them}} quit or for recreational use. <b>E-cigarette</b> use is also rising among women.|$|E

40|$|Physicians {{are rated}} the most {{trustworthy}} {{source of information}} for smokers and thus play an increasing role in disseminating information on <b>e-cigarettes</b> to patients. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand what is currently being communicated about <b>e-cigarettes</b> between physicians and patients. This study explored the knowledge, beliefs, communication, and recommendation of <b>e-cigarettes</b> among physicians of various specialties. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in early 2016 with 35 physicians across five different specialties. Interviews were transcribed and coded for the following deductive themes: (1) tobacco cessation recommendation practices, (2) knowledge of <b>e-cigarettes,</b> (3) communication of <b>e-cigarettes</b> with patients, (4) recommendation of <b>e-cigarettes,</b> and (5) general beliefs about <b>e-cigarettes.</b> Physicians across all specialties reported having conversations with patients about <b>e-cigarettes.</b> Conversations were generally prompted by the patient inquiring about <b>e-cigarettes</b> as a cessation method. Overall, physicians felt there was a lack of information on the efficacy and long term health effects but despite lack of evidence, generally did not discourage patients from trying <b>e-cigarettes</b> as a cessation device. Although physicians did not currently recommend <b>e-cigarettes</b> over traditional cessation methods, they were open to recommending <b>e-cigarettes</b> in the future if adequate data became available suggesting effectiveness. Patients are inquiring about <b>e-cigarettes</b> with physicians across various specialties. Future research should continue to study physicians' perceptions/practices given their potential to impact patient behavior and the possibility that such perceptions may change over time in response to the evidence-base on <b>e-cigarettes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (<b>e-cigarettes)</b> are {{not currently}} approved or {{recommended by the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or various medical organizations; yet, they appear to play a substantial role in tobacco users' cessation attempts. This study reports on a physician survey that measured beliefs, attitudes, and behavior related to <b>e-cigarettes</b> and smoking cessation. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} study to measure attitudes toward <b>e-cigarettes</b> among physicians treating adult smokers. Using a direct marketing company, a random sample of 787 North Carolina physicians were contacted in 2013 through email, with 413 opening the email and 128 responding (response rate =  31 %). Physicians' attitudes towards <b>e-cigarettes</b> were measured through a series of close-ended questions. Recommending <b>e-cigarettes</b> to patients served as the outcome variable for a logistic regression analysis. Two thirds (67 %) of the surveyed physicians indicated <b>e-cigarettes</b> are a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35 % recommended them to their patients. Physicians were more likely to recommend <b>e-cigarettes</b> when their patients asked about them or when the physician believed <b>e-cigarettes</b> were safer than smoking standard cigarettes. Many North Carolina physicians are having conversations about <b>e-cigarettes</b> with their patients, and some are recommending them. Future FDA regulation of <b>e-cigarettes</b> may help provide evidence-based guidance to physicians about <b>e-cigarettes</b> and will help ensure that patients receive evidence-based recommendations about the safety and efficacy of <b>e-cigarettes</b> in tobacco cessation...|$|R
40|$|The UK Stop Smoking Services (SSS) are {{a source}} of {{information}} and advice on <b>e-cigarettes</b> for smokers and thus {{it is important to understand}} the knowledge of, and attitudes towards, <b>e-cigarettes</b> held by stop smoking practitioners. The datasets were English SSS quarterly monitoring returns (n = 207, 883) and an online survey of English SSS practitioners, managers, and commissioners between 26 th November and 15 th December 2014 (n = 1801). SSS monitoring data suggested 2 % of clients were using <b>e-cigarettes</b> to quit with SSS and that clients using <b>e-cigarettes</b> had similar quit rates to clients using Varenicline. Most SSS personnel are waiting for licenced <b>e-cigarettes</b> to become available before they will recommend them to clients. However, less than a quarter view <b>e-cigarettes</b> as “a good thing”. Managers and commissioners were more positive than practitioners. SSS personnel working for the NHS (hospitals and GP surgeries) were less positive about <b>e-cigarettes</b> than those employed elsewhere. <b>E-cigarettes</b> were cited as the most important reason for the recent decline in service footfall.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{experiences with}} {{and beliefs about}} <b>e-cigarettes</b> as safe and useful aids for smoking cessation among healthcare professionals providing smoking cessation services. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, anonymous structured questionnaires were completed by 179 healthcare professionals in public smoking cessation clinics across 20 regions in Italy. Results: Service providers reported that considerably more smokers made inquiries about <b>e-cigarettes</b> in 2014 than in 2013. The most frequent inquiries concerned the ingredients, safety and effectiveness of <b>e-cigarettes</b> as smoking cessation aids. Clients used <b>e-cigarettes</b> to quit smoking, cut down the number of conventional cigarettes smoked, have a safe alternative to smoking, and protect their health while continuing to smoke. More than 60 % of service providers reported favourable beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of <b>e-cigarettes,</b> and believed that <b>e-cigarettes</b> are as effective as other smoking cessation aids, including pharmacotherapy. Conclusions: Despite limited empirical evidence, service providers in Italy viewed <b>e-cigarettes,</b> as safe and effective smoking cessation aids. More concerted efforts are needed to improve knowledge about <b>e-cigarettes</b> among service providers, to guide their clinical practice and decision-making with respect to <b>e-cigarettes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (<b>e-cigarettes)</b> aerosolize nicotine {{and produce}} a vapor that emulates that of cigarettes but purportedly has fewer traditional toxins than secondhand smoke. Although <b>e-cigarettes</b> are widely sold online and by retailers, new research suggests that they may contain unexpected toxins and may provide unreliable nicotine delivery. Many countries have already banned or strictly regulated <b>e-cigarettes.</b> Currently in the United States, <b>e-cigarettes</b> are exempt from regulation as drug-delivery devices. Meanwhile, the presence of <b>e-cigarettes</b> on the Internet, including in Web searches, virtual user communities, and online stores where people sell <b>e-cigarettes</b> on commission, is increasing rapidly.

5000|$|Some {{batteries}} {{are not well}} designed, are made with poor quality components, or have defects. Major injuries have occurred from battery explosions and fires. A man endured a unilateral corneoscleral laceration with prolapsed iris tissue and hyphemato to the eye area when an <b>e-cigarette</b> exploded in his mouth. A young man endured bilateral corneal burns to the eye area when an <b>e-cigarette</b> exploded near his chest. <b>E-cigarette</b> explosions have resulted in burns, lost teeth, neck fractures, and battery acid contact to the face, mouth, and eyes. A man died when charging an <b>e-cigarette</b> blown up and caught on fire next to oxygen equipment. House and car fires and skin burns have resulted {{from some of the}} explosions. The explosions were the result of extended charging, use of unsuitable chargers, or design flaws. There is a possible risk to bystanders from <b>e-cigarette</b> explosions. There is also a risk of property damage as a result of flammable materials catching on fire from an <b>e-cigarette</b> explosion. The United States Fire Administration said that 25 fires and explosions were caused by e-cigarettes between 2009 and August 2014. In the UK fire service call-outs had risen, from 43 in 2013 to 62 in 2014. A 2015 PHE report concluded that the risks of fire from e-cigarettes [...] "appear to be comparable to similar electrical goods". Since e-cigarettes are not subjected to product safety testing, they may not have safety designs to avoid overheating, thermal runaway, and battery failure including fire and explosions. There is inadequate product labeling to inform users of the possible serious harms. The risk from serious adverse effects is low, but the aftermath may be disastrous in respect to an <b>e-cigarette</b> blast. Victims have filed lawsuits to make restitution from the <b>e-cigarette</b> blasts. Adverse effects may be under-reported because reports to the FDA is voluntary.|$|E
50|$|Some {{restaurants}} and bars have banned <b>e-cigarette</b> use. Others permit <b>e-cigarette</b> use {{but do not}} allow cloud-chasing.

50|$|The {{safety of}} {{electronic}} cigarettes is uncertain. There is little data about their safety, and considerable variability among <b>e-cigarettes</b> {{and in their}} liquid ingredients and thus {{the contents of the}} aerosol delivered to the user. Reviews on the safety of <b>e-cigarettes</b> have reached significantly different conclusions. A 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) report cautioned about potential risks of using <b>e-cigarettes.</b> Regulated US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) products such as nicotine inhalers are likely safer than <b>e-cigarettes,.</b> A systematic review suggests that <b>e-cigarettes</b> are less harmful than smoking and since they contain no tobacco and do not involve combustion, users may avoid several harmful constituents usually found in tobacco smoke.

50|$|Compared to {{traditional}} cigarettes, the general <b>e-cigarette</b> puff time is much longer, and requires a more forceful suction than a regular cigarette. The volume of vapor created by <b>e-cigarette</b> devices in 2012 declined with vaping. Thus, {{to create the}} same volume of vapor increasing puff force is needed. Later-generation e-cigarettes with concentrated nicotine liquids may deliver nicotine at levels similar {{to traditional}} cigarettes. Many <b>e-cigarette</b> versions include a voltage potentiometer to adjust the volume of vapor created. The amount of vapor produced {{is controlled by the}} power from the battery, which has led some users to adjust their devices to increase battery power.|$|E
50|$|The {{long-term}} effects regarding respiratory flow resistance are unknown. E-cigarettes could harm the respiratory system.
