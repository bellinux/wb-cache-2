The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E

In particular, we contrast <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> STEM career with the culturally-relevant alternative career choices of public sector employment and business occupations. We also explore {{the degree to which}} factors known to influence career <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> previous studies conducted outside the region – and in particular, the U.

We aim to answer the following questions: (1) What motivates students to indicate <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> STEM over occupations in business or the military? (2) To what extent does the education system <b>in</b> Qatar shape <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> STEM career...|$|R

In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.

The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States.

5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negotiated solution.|$|E
