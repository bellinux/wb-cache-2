5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
