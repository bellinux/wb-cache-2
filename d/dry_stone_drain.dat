5000|$|The second site {{excavated}} by AAFS—Building 4—was {{similar to}} Building 3, {{although it was}} smaller (2.7m by 5.6m internally) and had more rounded corners. It too was a single-room house with <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> and earth walls and a single door in the southwest wall. There was a small diagonal <b>stone</b> <b>drain</b> running north/south across the floor. Fascinatingly the dwelling had not one, but three hearths. The first was located centrally near {{the door and the}} other two were along the northeast long wall. The multiple hearths can be interpreted in different ways. They may indicate episodic occupation of the house or a deliberate reconfiguration of the way the space was used—possibly connected with changes in domestic industry for example. Both buildings yielded a significant assemblage of ceramics largely made up of refined English earthenwares, with smaller quantities of coarse earthenwares. The ceramics indicate occupation in the late-eighteenth to early-nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>stone,</b> {{sometimes}} called drystack or, in Scotland, drystane, is a building {{method by which}} structures are constructed from stones without any mortar to bind them together. <b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> structures are stable because of their unique construction method, which {{is characterized by the}} presence of a load-bearing façade of carefully selected interlocking <b>stones.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> technology is best known in the context of wall construction, but <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> artwork, buildings, bridges, and other structures also exist.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dry</b> <b>Stone</b> Walling Association of Canada (aka <b>Dry</b> <b>Stone</b> Canada) (website: www.drystonecanada.com) {{believes}} that Amherst Island contains the largest known concentration of historic Irish <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> walls in Canada. Many {{of the walls}} {{are considered to be}} at least 170 years old or older. In September 2015 <b>Dry</b> <b>Stone</b> Canada held the Irish-Canadian International <b>Dry</b> <b>Stone</b> Festival on Amherst Island, inviting a number of Irish wallers to attend including Patrick McAfee, Sunny Wieler, and Ken Curran. There were two significant <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> structures built as a legacy to commemorate the original Irish settlers. On {{the last day of the}} Festival the setting sun was perfectly framed in the opening in the Celtic Cross allowing a sunbeam to project through it onto a wall beyond that held a carved Claddagh stone symbolizing the link between Canada and Ireland. Now around mid-March and again around September 27th the setting sun perfectly aligns to create a wonderful connection with the past.|$|R

50|$|A {{pedestrian}} footbridge (No 1) {{is located}} on the northern boundary of Lissner Park. The footbridge is a simple beam bridge with a pair of steel girders supporting a timber deck spanning the 10.2 m wide gap between the two concrete piers on either side of <b>stone</b> pitched <b>drain,</b> with a north-south orientation. A 15 cm thick slab of pre-stressed concrete approximately 1.13 m wide has been laid over the timber deck. Originally Mosman Creek, the drain contains the remains of the original <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> wall on the northern side, however the southern side has been covered with concrete. There are round steel handrails {{on both sides of the}} footbridge.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> walls can be {{built against}} {{embankments}} or even vertical terraces. If they are subjected to lateral earth pressure, they are retaining walls of the type gravity wall. The weight of the stones resists the pressure from the retained soil, including any surcharges, and the friction between the stones causes most of them {{to act as if}} being a monolithic gravity wall of the same weight. <b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> retaining walls were once built in great numbers for agricultural terracing and also to carry paths, roads and railways. Although <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> is seldom used for these purposes today, a great many are still in use and maintained. New ones are often built in gardens and nature conservation areas. <b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> retaining structures continue to be a subject of research.|$|R

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>stone</b> constructions are {{widespread}} throughout {{many regions}} across the world, {{in a wide}} variety of forms, according to the environmental and socio-economic contexts, and constitute a valuable know-how which is today in danger of disappearing. In Sicily <b>dry</b> <b>stone</b> works have traditionally been used in the area of Val di Noto where they constitute a key character of the landscape, and in the Madonie Mounts in which some policies of enhancement have been recently initiated. In the framework of the Grundtvig programme “La préservation du patrimoine architectural bâti en pierre sèche”, an in-depth analysis of these architectures have been pursued, aiming to create a database inventory.
