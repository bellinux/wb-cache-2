40|$|Molybdenum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} strategy metals. Recent decades saw wild fluctuations of molybdenum products' prices, with the continuous and steady growth of cumulative production as well as equilibrium of supply and demand. This paper measures the closing prices of two stocks, LYMY(3993. HK) and JMGF(601958), as well as the price of ferro-molybdenum(FOB, 60 %, Chinese main ports), from April 17 to December 31, 2008,based on the modem econometric models and methods, such as ARIMA Model and Impluse Function, shows the impact of Chinese <b>ferro-molybdenum</b> physical market on Chinese molybdenum stock market, which is higher than the impact of Chinese molybdenum stock market on Chinese <b>ferro-molybdenum</b> market, and longer for about 1 month...|$|E
40|$|In this study, SAE 1020 steel {{surfaces}} were separately alloyed with preplaced high-carbon-ferro-chromium (FeCr), <b>ferro-molybdenum</b> (FeMo) and ferro-titanium (FeTi) powders {{by using}} plasma transferred arc (PTA) heat source. By using three {{different types of}} shielding gas compositions during the alloying process, the study investigated the effects of modified shielding gas composition on the microstructure, hardness, and abrasive wear resistance of specimens. The most homogenous microstructure and the highest wear resistance was obtained in the gaseous environment which included 3 % of H 2. Increasing this rate to 5 % in the shielding gaseous composition caused gaps and pores in the microstructure and caused {{a decrease in the}} wear resistance. The x-ray examinations of the specimens identified <b>ferro-molybdenum</b> and ferro-titanium solid solutions, ferrit, austenite and martensite phases in their microstructure as the first phase and FeC, Cr 7 C 3, Cr 3 C 2, Fe 3 C, Fe 7 C 3, MoC and TiC phases as the second phase. As a result, it was concluded that changes in shielding gas composition in surface alloying process affected specimens ’ microstructure and abrasive wear properties...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the experimental results obtained on ferro-alloys (ferro-manganese, ferro-chromium, ferro-silicon and <b>ferro-molybdenum)</b> spectrochemical analysis by wavelength- dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF). The samples were prepared by solid solution technique. The precision {{of the sample}} preparation method was determined {{in the case of}} ferro-manganese. The calibration curves for all chemical elements of interest were established using certified reference materials produced by BAS-England and Brammer Standards-USA. The comparison of the experimental results and the allowed deviations by wet chemical analysis methods confirms the analytical performances of WDXRF spectrochemical method on samples prepared by solid solution technique...|$|E
40|$|The authors tried {{corrosion}} {{tests on the}} cast iron which were treated by the complex inoculants, namely calcium-silicon and <b>ferro-molybdenum.</b> These materials had been researched in the authors laboratory and recognized {{to be most effective}} on the strength or other mechanical properties of the cast iron. The authors used as corrosive agents nitric acid, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid of each one, ten and twenty percent density solution, and asso used glaclal aceec acid. On the results of the experiments the authors recognized that these pieces were most deeply corroded by nitric acid, and corrosive force grew weak by degrees of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and glacial aceic acid. Hydrochloric acid solutin, except twenty percent solution, dcreased the corrosion loss in accordance with the increase of the inoculated ferro-nolybenun, but on the contrary nitric acid, sulfuric acid and glacial acetic acid increased the corrosion loss in accordance with the increase of that inoculant. The increase of the density of nitric or hydrochloric acid soluton caused the increase of the corrosion losss. In the case of sulfuric acid, the authors recognized that ten percent solution had the strongest in fluence on the corrosion. And the corrosion loss in the cast iron of three percent carbon content was also recognized to be larger than in that of two point eight percent carbon content. 鋳鉄に対するMoの影響に関しては古くから多くの研究がなされており報告も少くないようである。然しこれまでは合金銭鉄としての研究が主で，近年盛んに行われるようになった接種鋳鉄としての報告は未だ少数で，我々は接種実験に於いて今までに各種の接種剤の使用を試みた結果その中でMoの接種が特に顕著な効力を有することをつきとめた。即ちCa-SiとFe-Moを複合併用することにより機械的性質，硬度，組織等の向上がみられ抗張力では 40 ～ 50 kg/㎟程度が得られた。これら接種鋳鉄の各種性能調査の一環として腐蝕性も調べてみることにした...|$|E
