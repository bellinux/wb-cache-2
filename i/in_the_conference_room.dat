5|$|In the epilogue, {{several of}} the staff share {{thoughts}} about Michael in private interviews. The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, {{unaware he has already}} left, with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E
5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E

5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below the desks so Charles, who is sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room,</b> will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael {{she wants to be}} a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E
5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries {{a number of different}} things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

Unable to tolerate Kelly’s trash-talk, Pam builds a makeshift ping pong table <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room</b> for Jim to practice against other office employees. [...] Throughout the day, Jim practices against his coworkers, eventually discovering Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) prowess at the game. When Jim and Darryl have a rematch, Jim again loses to Darryl. Fed up with Kelly's continued taunting, Pam challenges {{her to a}} game of ping pong, but the two play poorly. Jim and Darryl quickly bore of watching them and decide to play ping pong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>room.</b> The episode concludes with Dwight playing a high-intensity game of ping pong against his cousin Mose Schrute (Michael Schur), with the two at an apparent stalemate.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{algorithm}} was good, the reference microphone was an unpredictable variable: it had practical placement problems.

Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E

Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement.

5000|$|More significantly, {{the workers}} and administrators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{planning}} meetings and courting donors, are able to survey {{almost half of the}} employees simply by looking out of the window. Ada Louise Huxtable quotes Roche explaining, “It will be possible in this building to look across the court and see your fellow man or sit on a bench and discuss the problems of Southeast Asia. There will be a total awareness of the foundation’s activities.” [...] Not only did he feel that the role of the building is to subtly encourage people conscious of their surroundings, he believed that he could strengthen the moral mission of the foundation, allowing the administration a panoptical perspective of the staff, while subverting that effect by keeping the administration, donor, and <b>conference</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>the</b> most transparent and visible of all. Sight can act as a form of control, and this building successfully allows different elements of the power dynamic to hold each other in check, just a little bit more, by internalizing that one is constantly under gentle scrutiny by the sheer fact of the building.|$|R
