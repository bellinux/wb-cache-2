50|$|Because of a {{large number}} of {{different}} pipes and tubes to detach during maintenance, the repair procedure for some of the vehicle's mechanisms is hard (for example, replacement or repair of a starter). The electric drive of an air outlet hatch of a gas turbine engine (part of the vehicle's electric power supply system) has an inconvenient location (at the bottom of the hull) which causes overheating and sometimes, jamming of the electric drive. On the other hand, the construction of the electric power supply system is very reliable.

40|$|Filtration is a {{critical}} process in many industrial systems to obtain the desired level of purification for liquids or gas. Air, <b>fuel,</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> {{are the most common}} examples in industrial systems. Filter clogging is the main failure mode leading to filter replacement or undesired outcomes such as reduced performance and efficiency or cascading failures. For example, contaminants in fuel (e. g. rust particles, paint chips, dirt involved into fuel while tank is filling, tank moisture rust) may lead to performance reduction in the engine and rapid wear in the pump. Prognostics has potential to avoid cost and increase safety when applied to filters. One of the main challenges of prognostics is the lack of failure degradation data obtained from industrial systems. This paper presents the process of design and building of an experimental rig to obtain prognostics data for filter clogging mechanism and data obtained from the rig. Two types of filters have been used during the accelerated filter clogging and 23 run-to-failure data have been collected. Flow rate and pressure sensors are used for condition monitoring purposes. The filter clogging has been recorded through a camera to evaluate the findings with pressure and flow sensors. The data collected is very promising for development of prognostics methodologies...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{interest}} of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. Originally developed for use in race cars {{as a way to}} prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, the system circulated twelve litres of oil between the storage tank mounted inside the right front fender and the engine as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes and replacement of the air, <b>fuel,</b> <b>oil</b> and power-steering-fluid <b>filters.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Early {{automobile}} engines {{did not use}} <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> For this reason, {{along with}} the generally low quality of oil available, very frequent oil changes were required. The first <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> were simple, generally consisting of a screen placed at the oil pump intake. On November 27, 1923, American inventors George Greenhalgh and Ernest Sweetland filed U.S. Patent #1721250 for an automotive <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> and called it the Purolator, a portmanteau of [...] "pure oil later". The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> was the first <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> invented for the automobile and revolutionized the filtration industry. The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is still in production today. This original invention was a bypass filter: most of the oil flowed directly from the oil pan to the engine's working parts, and a smaller proportion of the oil was sent through the filter via a second flow path in parallel with the first. The <b>oil</b> was thus <b>filtered</b> over time. Modern bypass <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> systems for diesel engines are becoming popular in consumer applications, but have been in commercial use for some time due to potential reduction in maintenance costs.Oil filters are generally located near the middle or bottom of the engine.|$|R
