5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E

25|$|Codreanu studied law in Iași, {{where he}} began his {{political}} career. Like his father, he became close to A. C. Cuza. Codreanu's fear of Bolshevik insurrection led to his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> industrial workers himself. At the time, Cuza was preaching that the Jewish population was a manifest threat to Romanians, claimed that Jews were threatening the purity of Romanian young women, and began campaigning in favor of racial segregation.|$|E
25|$|In Malawi it is {{also common}} {{practice}} to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts {{are trying to make}} a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches. Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> this problem.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> phylogenetic studies. Only three have {{assessed}} more than 10 species and only one has included multiple outgroups. Nearly all previous molecular analyses of the Pectinidae have only utilized mitochondrial data. Phylogenies based only on mitochondrial sequence data do not always provide an accurate estimation on the species tree. Complicated factors can arise due to the presence of genetic polymorphisms in ancestral species and resultant lineage sorting.|$|E

In November 2006, the corporation made river clean-up a priority for the organization, which included watershed-wide education <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> non-point-source water pollution. The corporation announced strict environmental standards for its developers in February 2007 {{in order to help}} reduce wastewater runoff into the river. The AWC's efforts to develop site-specific environmental design guidelines won awards from the National Capital Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers and GreenHOME (an organization which recommends environmentally safe products for residential homes).|$|E
25|$|Canada adopted {{its first}} Official Languages Act in 1969, in {{response}} to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. The current Official Languages Act was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the Charter of Rights, it was necessary to create a legislative framework within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional obligations regarding the official languages.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, since 1989 many {{previously}} skeptical petroleum and automobile industry corporations {{have changed their}} position as the political and scientific consensus has grown, {{with the creation of}} the Kyoto Protocol and the publication of the International Panel on Climate Change's Second and Third Assessment Reports. These corporations include major petroleum companies like Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco, and BP, as well as automobile manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler. Some of these have joined with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change), a non-profit organization aiming to support <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> global climate change.|$|E

25|$|In May 2017, Ford {{announced}} cuts to {{its global}} workforce amid <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the company's declining share price {{and to improve}} profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America this year to enhance earnings in 2018. Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping the 114-year-old auto maker better compete with Uber Technologies Inc., Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1939, Dr. Peter Goldmark and {{his staff}} at Columbia Records and at CBS Laboratories {{undertook}} <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive, reliable consumer playback system. It took about eight years of study, except when it was suspended because of World War II. Finally, the 12-inch (30cm) Long Play (LP) rpm microgroove record album was introduced by the Columbia Record Company at a New York press conference on June 18, 1948. At the same time, Columbia introduced a vinyl 7-inch rpm microgroove single, calling it ZLP, but it was short-lived and is very rare today, because RCA Victor introduced a 45rpm single a few months later, which became the standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{power sector}} in Brazil was {{essentially}} in government's hands {{until the early}} 1990s. The sector had seen remarkable development in the 1970s. However, by the late 1980s, the state-ownership model {{was on the verge}} of collapse. This delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a revenue shortfall in the sector of about US$35 billion, which led to the delay in the construction of about 15 large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment. <b>Efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the deterioration of the sector were not successful, a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms. A major commitment was made by President Cardoso to carry out a substantial reform of the Brazilian electricity sector. The first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to improve its economic situation.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative was {{launched}} <b>to</b> <b>address</b> this gap in international law.

25|$|International catastrophes such as {{the wreck}} of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity {{such as the}} Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.|$|E
500|$|A {{breakthrough}} in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred {{as a result of}} United States President George W. Bush's state visit to Vietnam in November 2006.

500|$|The smog {{brought into}} focus the {{complexity}} and interdependency of environmental problems and other issues of urban life.

[...] <b>Efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> a given environmental problem can cause undesired side effects, sometimes unforeseeable, which are often related to a city's limited resources.|$|E
