40|$|Ce-containing endohedral fullerenes were {{produced}} by the so-called reversed arc technique developed by the Nagoya group as described previously. 1 A Ce-doped graphite rod (anode) was kept a few mm apart from a graphite block (cathode) in a vacuum chamber. The rod and the block were connected to an external power supply and high current was passed through them (300 – 500 A). The vaporisation took place in He atmosphere (50 – 100 Torr). The resulting soot contained 10 – 20 % fullerenes. The fullerenes were soxhlet-extracted from the soot for ca. 4 hours in o-xylene. A two-stage high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was employed to isolate individual fullerene isomers.

Thus, in this study, boiling water was the most appropriate solvent for extraction of barakol and other chemical constituents from herbal recipes. Furthermore, Thai traditional medicine uses alcoholic solvent for extraction of the main components from S. siamea and uses boiling water for extraction of S. siamea containing formulae.

Methodology – <b>HPLC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> of seed extracts were recorded under the same conditions.

30|$|In {{an initial}} {{analysis}} of the LNISO data for the 18 Allergan compounds, three of these compounds (A 3, A 9 and A 18) were quickly excluded from the more complete study. The first of the excluded compounds, A 3, was so unstable that even the time-zero sample (stored in the freezer) showed a large degradation peak in the <b>HPLC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> (> 20 % by peak area). Two other compounds, A 9 and A 18, were excluded due to significant and persistent precipitation that was discovered after {{the removal of the}} stability samples from the freezer. Lower solubility and recrystallization upon storage at − 20  °C may possibly explain the precipitation. The presence of precipitated materials in stability samples for these two compounds caused large variations in the measured drug concentrations that made the data analysis difficult. Another set of three compounds (A 8, A 16, and A 17), showed no statistically significant decrease in parent peak, but fortunately, there was only one major degradation product for each compound as indicated by the <b>HPLC</b> <b>chromatograms.</b> The degradation rate constants for these compounds could be determined with a high precision by monitoring growth of the single degradant of each compound. Since the response factors of the degradants were unknown, an assumption was made that the degradants have the same response factors as the parent drugs.
