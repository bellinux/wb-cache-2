5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc.

In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III <b>hyperlipidaemia.</b> Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1.

40|$|Of {{the primary}} <b>hyperlipidaemias,</b> {{familial}} hypercholesterolaemia (hyerbetalipoproteinaemia, type II) is always expressed in childhood and carries {{a high risk}} for the early development of coronary heart disease.

Screening of the general population in order to detect this disorder is not advocated. Treatment by either diet or drugs will lower serum cholesterol but long-term compliance is poor and the effect of treatment on the atherosclerotic process has not been evaluated.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of <b>hyperlipidaemias</b> has been inadequately studied in rural populations of developing countries. No significant data {{exist on the}} population levels of serum cholesterol, cholesterol subclasses or triglycerides in these countries. Methods: We studied fasting blood samples of 300 apparently healthy adults (202 men and 98 women, age range 20 - 73 years) randomly selected from a larger sample of 31 48 individuals during a comprehensive cardiovascular risk-factor survey in Rajasthan, India. Levels of serum total cholesterol, its subfractions [low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol] and triglycerides were measured and correlated with age and anthropometric data.

The response rate was 85 % (288 / 340) but some respondents failed to answer each section of every question. One hundred and eighty-five general practitioners (64 %) had previously referred patients to the clinic. Most respondents selectively asked for blood cholesterol measurements in patients with major cardiovascular risk factors (94 %, 266 / 283), and few routinely asked for cholesterol as part of a health check (17 %, 43 / 258). Most thought that referral to a clinic was appropriate for children (65 %, 149 / 229), for patients aged 20 to 39 (85 %, 209 / 247), and for older patients aged up to 60 (77 %, 186 / 243). Ninety-four per cent (260 / 277) wanted access to specialist advice for patients with a cholesterol concentration exceeding 8. 0 mmol l- 1, and 73 % (197 / 270) wanted specialist advice before starting treatment with a lipid-lowering drug. Although most respondents rated the service provided by the clinic favourably, more than half would have liked more information on prognosis, drug treatment, long-term follow-up, and screening of family members. We conclude that general practitioners would like access to specialist advice for the management of severe <b>hyperlipidaemias,</b> and that cardiovascular screening programmes in primary care have important resource implications for specialist services...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine how}} {{insurance}} companies assess proposals for life assurance from applicants with raised cholesterol concentrations {{and to determine}} the excess mortality rating applied. DESIGN: Survey of 49 companies underwriting term life assurance. SETTING: United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: Four fictional men aged 30 seeking 20 year term policies paying benefit only on death. Two had total cholesterol concentrations of 6. 4 and 8. 1 mmol/l but no other cardiovascular risk factors; one was overweight, hypertensive, smoked 20 cigarettes daily, and had a total cholesterol concentration of 8. 1 mmol/l; and one had possible familial hypercholesterolaemia and a total cholesterol concentration of 10. 7 mmol/l after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage excess mortality rating. RESULTS: All companies used explicit criteria to assess the mortality risk associated with <b>hyperlipidaemias,</b> and 47 companies applied the same criteria to men and women. No excess mortality rating was imposed on an applicant with a total cholesterol concentration of 6. 4 mmol/l, but a small excess was applied to an applicant with a concentration of 8. 1 mmol/l (median excess 50 %, range 0 - 75 %). When multiple cardiovascular risk factors were present the same concentration of 8. 1 mmol/l resulted in a substantial excess (median 135 %, range 50 - 200 %). A smaller but more variable excess was applied to an applicant with possible familial hypercholesterolaemia (median 75 %, range 0 - 200 %). CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable differences among companies in the excess mortality ratings applied, increases in term life assurance premiums {{are likely to be}} restricted to patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia, in particular those with familial hypercholesterolaemia. In the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors milder hypercholesterolaemia is unlikely to result in higher premiums...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dexamethasone}} (a synthetic glucocorticoid) and insulin on the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were investigated. Rat hepatocytes in monolayer culture were preincubated for 15 h {{in the presence}} or absence of combinations of 100 nM-dexamethasone and 2 nM-, 10 nM- or 50 nM-insulin. Dexamethasone increased [3 H]oleate incorporation into secreted triacylglycerol by 2. 7 -fold and the mass of triacylglycerol secreted by 1. 5 -fold. Insulin alone decreased these parameters and antagonized the effect of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone increased the secretion of [3 H]leucine in apolipoprotein (apo) E, and in the large (BH) and small (BI) forms of apo B in VLDL by about 7. 1 -, 3. 6 - and 4. 0 -fold respectively. Insulin alone decreased the secretion of these 3 H-labelled apolipoproteins in VLDL. However, 2 nM-insulin with dexamethasone increased the secretion of 3 H-labelled apo BH and apo BL by a further 0. 8 - and 3. 2 -fold respectively; 50 nM-insulin decreased the secretions of apo E, apo BH and apo BL in VLDL. Similar effects for dexamethasone or insulin alone were also obtained for the masses of apo E and apo BL + H secreted in VLDL. Albumin secretion was not significantly altered by either dexamethasone or insulin alone, but in combination they stimulated by 2. 1 - 2. 6 -fold. Insulin or dexamethasone alone had little effect on the secretion of apolipoproteins in the HDL fraction. However, dexamethasone plus 2 nM-insulin increased the incorporation of [3 H]leucine into apo AI, apo AH plus apo C, apo AIV and apo E of HDL by about 1. 8 -, 1. 6 -, 1. 7 - and 2. 0 -fold respectively. The apo E in the bottom fraction represented about 69 % of the total 3 H-labelled apo E secreted. The responses in the total secretion of apo E from the hepatocytes resembled those seen in HDL.
