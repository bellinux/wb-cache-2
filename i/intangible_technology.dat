This paper seeks to examine whether, {{in the case of}} Nigeria, such MNE's utilise similar technology to that of Nigerian firms, and the implications for government policy on achieving technology transfer. Although tentative, the findings suggest that DC MNE's in Nigeria do not tend to acquire technology primarily from their home country, and suggests that although tangible technology that is transferred is similar to that directly acquired by domestic firms, there is nonetheless a difference in the nature in the <b>intangible</b> <b>technology</b> between the two groups 1...|$|E

Terrorists {{have been known to}} utilise websites and emails to place manuals, instructions, blueprints and other documents, known as <b>Intangible</b> <b>Technology</b> Transfer (ITT), to incite and encourage their peers to create biological weapons; subsequently, to launch an attack of bioterrorism. Simultaneously, terrorists may camouflage their identity and attend oral and visual exchanges such as teleconferences, virtual meetings and skills training sessions that disseminate relevant information on biological weapons. This makes it possible for terrorists who already possess some background knowledge of biological weapons to further their interests in creating these weapons. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse Malaysia's STA 2010 concerning relevant provisions that are able to address the threat of ITT over the internet and telecommunications by terrorists in the context of disseminating knowledge of biological weapons to perpetuate bioterrorism. The results show that the provisions of Sections 2, 4, 9 and 10 of STA 2010 are relevant in addressing the ITT of individuals using the internet to encourage creating biological weapons abroad by involving extraterritorial jurisdiction, extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters.

40|$|International {{cooperation}} on export controls for technology {{is based on}} three assumptions, that it is possible: to know against whom controls should be directed; to control the international transfer of technology; and to deﬁne the items to be controlled. These assumptions paint a very hierarchical framing {{of one of the}} central problems in export controls: dual-use technology. This hierarchical framing has been in continual contention with a competitive framing that views the problem as the marketability of technology. This thesis analyses historical and contemporary debates between these two framings of the problem of dual-use technology, focusing on the multilateral Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. Using a framework of concepts from Science & Technology Studies and the theory of sociocultural viability, I analyse the Arrangement as a classiﬁcation system, where political, economic, and social debates are codiﬁed in the lists of controlled items, which then structure future debates. How a technology is (not) deﬁned, I argue, depends as much on the particular set of social relations in which the technology is enacted as on any tangible aspects the technology may have. The hierarchical framing is currently hegemonic within Wassenaar, and I show how actors that express this framing use several strategies in resolving anomalies that arise concerning the classiﬁcation of dual-use technology. These strategies have had mixed success, and I show how they have adequately resolved some cases (e. g. quantum cryptography), while other areas have proved much more diﬃcult (e. g. focal plane arrays and computers). With the development of controls on <b>intangible</b> <b>technology</b> transfers, a third, egalitarian framing is arising, and I argue that initial steps have already been taken to incorporate this framing with the discourse on dual-use technology. However, the rise of this framing also calls into question the fundamental assumption of export controls that technology is excludable, and therefore deﬁnable...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Creativity and {{innovation}} are now required given the new configurations in work processes, in organizational formats, in physical and <b>intangible</b> <b>technologies,</b> {{as well as}} in products and markets. In parallel with the growing centrality and interest in the phenomena of creativity {{and innovation}}, a broadening of its concepts is observed. The inflation and trivialization of uses tend to make them self-explanatory and not very enlightening regarding situations to which they apply and the associated effects. The lack of conceptual clarity thus contributes both to undermining policies to promote creativity and innovation in organizations, as well as to hinder the employees' adherence to such policies. The study aimed to characterize the key elements of workers' informal definitions of creativity and innovation, and identify their alignment with definitions and theoretical perspectives. The study included 231 workers from Portuguese-, Spanish-, and Basque-speaking countries, aged 22 - 75 years. The qualitative data analysis software ATLAS. ti 7 was used for coding and categorization. One point of convergence with the specialized literature was that creativity and innovation strongly associated with novelty in the development of an idea / product / process / service. Creativity, however, is defined more in terms of dispositional factors rather than contextual and situational factors, diverging from current theoretical perspectives. Planning as a key aspect for organizational innovation development is practically absent from the workers' definitions.

30|$|Liability of foreignness {{refers to}} the {{disadvantage}} a firm operating in a foreign market faces vis-à-vis local firms. This was the basic assumption underlying theories of the multinational firm (Buckley and Casson 1976; Caves 1982; Dunning 1981). The concept was pioneered by Hymer (1976), who argued that a firm establishing an operation abroad faces costs, which local firms do not. These costs may stem from higher coordination costs, unfamiliarity with the local market or culture, lack of networks or political influence or reluctance of customers to buy foreign goods. Theories of the multinational firm argue that firms can internationalize because they possess a firm-specific advantage which is crucial for overcoming and compensating for the liability of foreignness. The firm compensates this disadvantage through gains stemming from its <b>intangible</b> assets (brand, <b>technology,</b> managerial practices). Equipping foreign subsidiaries with such assets allows them to overcome the disadvantage associated with liability of foreignness.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the quality and quantity indicators of physical capital and modernisation. While international academic literature emphasises the role of <b>intangible</b> factors enabling <b>technology</b> generation and absorption rather than that of physical capital accumulation, this paper argues that {{the quantity and quality of}} physical capital are important modernisation factors, particularly in the case of small, undercapitalised countries that recently integrated into the world economy. The paper shows that in Hungary, as opposed to developed countries, the technological upgrading of capital assets was not necessarily accompanied by the upgrading of human capital i. e. the thesis of capital skill complementarity did not apply to the first decade of transformation and capital accumulation in Hungary. Finally, the paper shows that there are large differences between the average technological levels of individual industries. The dualism of the Hungarian economy, which is also manifest in terms of differences in the size of individual industries' technological gaps, is a disadvantage from the point of view of competitiveness. The increasing differences in the size of the technological gaps can be explained not only with industry-specific factors, but also with the weakness of technology and regional development policies, as well as with institutional deficiencies...|$|R

Only a quarter of technological experiments {{in a sample of}} 100 studies addresses the intangible of technological practice, and this project sets out to explore if there are conceptual or practical obstacles for this low rate. The thesis begins with an in-depth examination of experimental archaeology and the criteria, paradigms and theories that determine its practice. Through this study, elements of the dichotomy positivism//postmodernism are uncovered and discussed. To resolve this dualism, a third paradigm – philosophical pragmatism – is introduced as an alternative. This conceptual debate represents Part I, and is subsequently collated into a methodological framework {{for the creation of a}} typified experiment. Part II consists of the experimental segment of this study, in search for practical obstacles for the exploration of the intangible. Through experimenting with Iron Age Bucket-shaped pots, Mesolithic faceted pebbles and Middle Palaeolithic birch bark tar production, different components of an experiment are highlighted for investigation. An element that comes forward as problematic is the relationship between experimental archaeologists and science ideals that is underscored by experimental tradition. Conclusively, the final discussion leaves the conceptual and practical barriers that may prevent archaeologists from studying the <b>intangible</b> aspects of <b>technology</b> overturned. In sum, this may enable experimental archaeologists to take a fuller view of their own practice and that of the people of the past. University of Exete...|$|R

Investigating on how foreign subsidiaries respond to the external challenges is essential to support strategic knowledge on managing industry? Under the influence of market turbulence. This empirical study used qualitative data from interviews with eight managers of foreign furniture processing subsidiaries in Vietnam. Results indicated that under the influences of global downturn, managers have become more proactive and flexible in their strategic planning when facing with chaotic turbulence, which brings both opportunities and challenges. The study {{pointed out that the}} negative impact of global recession was passed through in later time in low-cost manufacturing countries and business risks could be minimized especially in companies with a strong pool of <b>intangible</b> resources (reputation, <b>technology,</b> innovation capability). Despite its complexity, recession was not completely seen a threat, yet the managers perceived it as external turbulence from which organizations can benefit but only if they choose the right strategic orientation...|$|R
40|$|WWWforEurope Deliverable No. 9, 40 pages The Europe’s 2020 Strategy clearly {{outlines}} the ambition for EU {{member states to}} pursue a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth: this means designing a the strategy that aims at achieving a socio-ecological transition by fostering economic growth {{as well as social}} development (e. g. with respect to employment, gender or cultural aspects) whilst also pushing for Europe’s green shift. To deliver the EU 2020 strategy a new definition of competitiveness needs to be considered. Aiginger et al. (2013) propose defining competitiveness as the ability to deliver beyond-GDP goals’. Competitiveness should be based on capabilities like skills, innovation, institutions, an empowering social system, and ecological ambitions. Outcomes should be defined by the achievement of ecological, social and economic goals. The new industrial policy for Europe will be underpinned by four game changers: (a) From GDP to beyond-GDP (b) A new definition of competitiveness (c) the green shift and (d) high road growth. Aiginger (2015) proposes to define industrial policy as economic policy to promote the competitiveness of a country or region, where competitiveness is defined as the ability to deliver the beyond-GDP goals. This means an industrial policy that shows leadership towards Europe’s green shift; this means not only pursuing -for instance- energy efficiency and applications of the circular economy, but that supports the conversion of the economy into a green-intensive economy with the creation of new sectors, new processes, new products and the emergence of “green gazelles”, that can deliver growth and jobs through ecological innovations. Industrial policy should foster the long-run transition, not decelerate structural change. This is a demanding challenge, given vested interests and the traditional role of governments to preserve the status quo and national champions. Refocusing on the economy’s industrial base is a necessity to anchor long term socio-economic prosperity, particularly after the experience of bubbles in financial and real estate markets. A new industrial policy for Europe should therefore pursue a balanced economy and support the transition of traditional, narrowly defined manufacturing sectors to an advanced and distributed manufacturing sector able of greater value creation, innovation and creativity. A new industrial policy for Europe should be delivered by means of a portfolio of instruments that simultaneously steer demand and supply sides to move in the same direction creating and additive effect as against a cancelling-out effect. Such portfolio needs to avoid trade-offs between technological change and growth/employment priorities. Policy changes need to provide long-run and consistent signals, which provide certainty for businesses in making long term investments and short term adjustment. Technological upgrading instrument needs to be mission-oriented programmes, compatible with existing capabilities but enabling capabilities to be diversified. Universities, investment in <b>intangible</b> assets, new <b>technologies</b> and key enabling technologies, and entrepreneurship will be crucial to secure Europe on a growth path compatible with a beyond GDP competitive agenda...|$|R
