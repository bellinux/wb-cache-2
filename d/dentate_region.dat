40|$|Previous {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} {{have indicated that}} anesthetic block of neural activity at discrete sites within the limbic system, including the lateral hypothalamus and anterior cingulum bundle, causes a significant long-lasting analgesia during the formalin test. In this experiment, the local anesthetic lidocaine was microinjected into the <b>dentate</b> <b>region</b> of the hippocampus, an important limbic structure presumed to subserve the affective-motivational aspects of pain. The dentate gyrus is strategically situated at a point of convergence of widespread polysensory cortical input to the hippocampus, to allow modulation of cortical signals before they diverge into numerous limbic circuits. The results indicate that anesthetic block of the anterior region of the dentate gyrus produces analgesia in the rat during the formalin test. The analgesia produced by this procedure became apparent 30 minutes after regional block contralateral {{to the site of}} injury and persisted {{for the duration of the}} test period. These data provide further evidence that limbic forebrain structures are involved in pain and analgesia...|$|E
40|$|The CREB {{transcription}} factor mediates neuronal plasticity in many systems, {{but the relationship}} between CREB levels and CRE-mediated transcription in individual neurons in vivo is unclear. In FVB/N nontransgenic mice, we observed that Purkinje cells showed low basal levels of Ser(133) -phosphorylated CREB protein yet displayed strong CRE-directed transcription. Transgenic mice overexpressing CREB in Purkinje cells and dentate gyrus granule cells showed a decreased CRE-lacZ signal in the same cells, indicating repression of ATF/CREB family function. <b>Dentate</b> <b>region</b> long-term potentiation was not altered by these changes in CREB expression. CREB transgenic mice demonstrated an inability to perform the rotarod task, without signs of overt ataxia. Our results demonstrate {{that the level of}} phosphorylated CREB protein is not a reliable indicator of CRE-mediated function. Furthermore, we conclude that CRE-mediated transcription may be linked to only a subset of cerebellum-mediated motor behaviors and may not be universally required for long-lasting synaptic potentiation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Neuropathological {{descriptions}} of the brain in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) were obtained before availability of the current molecular genetic tests for this disease. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) enables an unbiased whole-brain quantitative analysis of differences in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume. METHODS: Using VBM, we assessed the brain structural damage in 22 patients with genetically confirmed FRDA and 25 healthy controls. The results were correlated with the disease duration and {{the severity of the}} patients' clinical deficits [...] evaluated using the International Cerebellar Ataxia Rating Scale and Inherited Ataxia Clinical Rating Scale. RESULTS: In patients with FRDA, VBM showed a symmetrical volume loss in dorsal medulla, infero-medial portions of the cerebellar hemispheres, the rostral vermis and in the <b>dentate</b> <b>region.</b> No volume loss in cerebral hemispheres was observed. The atrophy of the cerebellum and medulla correlated with the severity of the clinical deficit and disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FRDA, significant GM and WM loss was observed only in the cerebellum and dorsal medulla. These structural changes correlate with the severity of the clinical deficit and disease duration...|$|E

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} with cognitive decline in both humans and animals and of all brain regions, the hippocampus appears to be particularly vulnerable to senescence. Age-related spatial learning deficits result from alterations in hippocampal connectivity and plasticity. These changes are differentially expressed {{in each of the}} hippocampal fields known as cornu ammonis 1 (CA 1), cornu ammonis 3 (CA 3), and the dentate gyrus. Each sub-region displays varying degrees of susceptibility to aging. For example, the CA 1 region is particularly susceptible in Alzheimerâ€™s disease while the CA 3 region shows vulnerability to stress and glucocorticoids. Further, in animals, aging is the main factor associated with the decline in adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This review discusses the relationship between region-specific hippocampal connectivity, morphology, and gene expression alterations and the cognitive deficits associated with senescence. In particular, data are reviewed that illustrate how the molecular changes observed in the CA 1, CA 3, and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions</b> are associated with age-related learning deficits. This topic is of importance because increased understanding of how gene expression patterns reflect individual differences in cognitive performance is critical to the process of identifying new and clinically-useful biomarkers for cognitive aging...|$|R
40|$|Field {{recordings}} of the entorhinal cortex (EC) were studied and compared to those recorded concomitantly in the <b>dentate</b> <b>region</b> of the hippocampal formation (HPC) in the urethane anesthetized rat. The EC, like the HPC, showed two main variations of spontaneous field activity: a desynchronized, large amplitude irregular activity and a synchronized, rhythmic, slow frequency field activity (RSA or theta). Corroborating previous research, a phase reversal was seen across layer I 1 of the EC and when recorded superficial to this layer, EC theta was phase-locked to that recorded from the HPC (dentate). Entorhinal cortex (and HPC) theta could be evoked by the application of moderate tail pinches (sensory stimulation), by pharmacological treatments enhancing cholinergic transmission, and by electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus. Spectral analysis revealed that in all cases, theta was produced coherently across the two limbic structures. Entorhinal cortex (and HPC) production of theta could be abolished by pharmacological treatments disrupting cholinergic transmission, and by reversible procaine inactivation of the medial septal region. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} limbic theta is modulated spontaneously, and with sensory and hypothalamic stimulation through the activity of cells in the medial septa...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 111 - 121) The {{contribution of}} the granule cell layer to the generation of hippocampal slow waves (theta) has been controversial due to the technical difficulty of isolating the contribution of this layer {{from that of the}} pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus. Recently it has been observed that most of the granule cell layer in the dentate of the rat hippocampus is mitotic postnatally while cells of the pyramidal cell layer are born prenatally. Thus it is possible to lesion this layer with medium levels of radiation while leaving the pyramidal cell layer intact. In this experiment hippocampal laminar profiles were performed on mature rats which had sustained granule cell lesion by radiation soon after birth. The most striking result was that, despite an 85 % cell reduction, theta activity in the dentate was more prominent than in controls. This was due to a loss of irregular fast activity in the <b>dentate</b> <b>region.</b> In addition, the phase advance seen in control animals during stimulated theta was absent in the irradiated animals. Finally, theta amplitude was decreased in the pyramidal cell layer and increased in the granule cell layer of the irradiated animals when compared to controls. These paradoxical results are discussed in terms of new evidence concerning granule cell plasticity following radiation...|$|E
40|$|In {{keeping with}} {{previous}} observations in the CA 1 and the somatosensory neocortex {{of the brain}} of rat, 20 -min applications of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 DG; 10 mM, replacing glucose) induced a long-term potentiation (LTP) -like enhancement of field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the <b>dentate</b> <b>region</b> of hippocampal slices. The effects of 2 DG were not identical at synapses of medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP). At MPP synapses, there was no post- 2 DG early depression of fEPSPs and the potentiation reached + 78. 6 +/- 5. 7 % (+/- standard error of the mean) 40 min after the return to glucose. In the presence of 50 microM D-amino-phosphono valerate (APV; an N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor antagonist), a marked post- 2 DG depression appeared and the subsequent LTP was reduced to + 34. 7 +/- 2. 8 % (for both 2 DG- and APV-treatment P< 0. 001 by ANOVA- 2 W). At LPP synapses, even under control conditions, there was a sharp post- 2 DG depression followed by LTP (+ 62. 2 +/- 5. 7 %) and APV {{had little effect on}} either the post- 2 DG depression or LTP, reducing the latter by only 24 % [the 2 DG treatment was very significant (P< 0. 001) but not the APV treatment]. Thus, 2 DG evokes both NMDAR-dependent and -independent components of LTP in the perforant pathways. In view of these findings, the consumption of 2 DG could have significant effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function...|$|E
40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) is {{a common}} neurological disease and antiseizure medication is often inadequate for preventing apoptotic cell death. Aerobic swimming exercise (EX) augments neurogenesis in rats when initiated immediately in the postictal period. This study tests the hypothesis that aerobic exercise also augments neurogenesis over the long term. Male Wistar rats (age of 4 months) were subjected to chemical lesioning using KA and to an EX intervention consisting of a 30 [*]d period of daily swimming for 15 [*]min, in one experiment immediately after KA lesioning (immediate exposure) and in a second experiment after a 60 [*]d period of normal activity (delayed exposure). Morphometric counting of neuron numbers (NN) and dendritic branch points and intersections (DDBPI) was performed in the CA 1, CA 3, and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions</b> of hippocampus, in basolateral nucleus of amygdala, and in several areas of motor cortex. EX increased NN and DDBPI in the normal control and the KA-lesioned rats in all four limbic and motor cortex areas studied, after both immediate and 60 [*]d delayed exposures to exercise. These findings suggest that, after temporal lobe epileptic seizures in rats, swimming exercise may improve neural plasticity {{in areas of the}} brain involved with emotional regulation and motor coordination, even if the exercise treatment is delayed...|$|R

To investigate if Bax {{plays a role in}} neuronal cell death and functional outcome after TBI, Bax gene disrupted (null) mice and wild-type (WT) controls were subjected to the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI. Motor function in WT and Bax null mice was evaluated using the round beam balance and the wire grip test on days 0 â€“ 5. Spatial memory was assessed using a Morris Water Maze adopted for mice on days 14 â€“ 18 post-injury. For histopathological analysis, animals were sacrificed 24 [*]h and 21 days post-injury. In all three behavioral tests, the sham and TBI-injured Bax null mice performed significantly worse than their WT sham and TBI-injured counterparts. However, Bax null mice exhibited a higher percentage of surviving neurons in the CA 1 and CA 3 regions of hippocampus measured at 21 days post-injury. At 24 [*]h after trauma, Bax null mice had fewer TUNEL positive cells in the CA 1 and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions</b> of hippocampus as compared to WT mice, suggesting that deletion of the Bax gene ameliorates hippocampal cell death after TBI. Sham-operated Bax null mice had significantly greater brain volume as compared to WT mice. Thus, it is possible that Bax deficiency in the transgenic mice produces developmental behavioral effects, perhaps due to Bax's role in regulating cell death during development...|$|R
40|$|We studied whether endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) is {{upregulated}} and uncoupled in large cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and also whether this causes cerebral vasospasm in a mouse model of anterior circulation SAH. Control animals underwent injection of saline instead of blood (n= 16 SAH and n= 16 controls). There was significant vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery 2 days after SAH (lumen radius/wall thickness ratio 4. 3 Â± 1. 3 for SAH, 23. 2 Â± 2. 1 for saline, P< 0. 001). Subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling, cleaved caspase- 3, and Fluoro-Jade-positive neurons in the cortex and with CA 1 and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions</b> in the hippocampus. There were multiple fibrinogen-positive microthromboemboli in the cortex and hippocampus after SAH. Transgenic mice expressing lacZ under control of the eNOS promoter had increased X-gal staining in large arteries after SAH, and this was confirmed by the increased eNOS protein on western blotting. Evidence that eNOS was uncoupled was found in that nitric oxide availability was decreased, and superoxide and peroxynitrite concentrations were increased in the brains of mice with SAH. This study suggests that artery constriction by SAH upregulates eNOS {{but that it is}} uncoupled and produces peroxynitrite that may generate microemboli that travel distally and contribute to brain injury...|$|R

In this report, the immunostaining density of six specific GABAA receptor subunit (a 1, a 2, b 1 â€“ 3 and g 2) antibodies was measured in the hippocampus and cortex, among other brain areas, in slide-mounted brain sections from flurazepam-treated and control rats using quantitative computer-assisted image analysis techniques. In parallel with the localized reduction in a 1 and b 3 subunit messenger RNA expression detected in a previous study, relative a 1 and b 3 subunit antibody immunostaining density was significantly decreased in flurazepam-treated rat hippocampal CA 1, CA 3 and dentate dendritic regions, and in specific cortical layers. Quantitative western blot analysis showed that b 3 subunit protein levels in crude homogenates of the hippocampal <b>dentate</b> <b>region</b> from flurazepam-treated rats, an area which showed fairly uniform decreases in b 3 subunit immunostaining (16 â€“ 21 %), were reduced to a similar degree (18 %). The latter findings provide independent support that relative immunostaining density may provide an accurate estimate of protein levels. Consistent with {{the absence of the}} regulation of their respective messenger RNAs immediately after ending flurazepam administration, no changes in the density of a 2, b 1 or b 2 subunit antibody immunostaining were found in any brain region. g 2 subunit antibody staining was changed only in the dentate molecular layer.

40|$|The Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) peptide amyloid beta 1 - 42 (AÎ² 42) {{has been}} shown to {{initiate}} death signalling through the p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR), however {{little is known about the}} AÎ² 42 -p 75 NTR mechanism of cell death or how such a mechanism would fit with what is known about amyloid pathology. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques, we demonstrate here that AÎ² 42 has excitatory properties which promote an increase in intracellular levels of calcium in neurons, which in turn causes an increase in G-protein activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels at the plasma membrane. p 75 NTR activates these GIRK channels to cause a sustained potassium efflux which leads to caspase activation and cell death. We found that the NMDA receptor is involved in the AÎ² 42 -initiated calcium overload in neurons, which drives the GIRK channel response. Further, chronic activation of the inhibitory GABAb receptor removes GIRK channels from the surface of the neuron and overrides neuronal death in vitro. We also show that GIRK channels are upregulated in response to excitotoxic insults in scenarios where p 75 NTR death signalling occurs. GIRK channels are increased in vivo in the <b>dentate</b> <b>region</b> of the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced seizures in mice, and in vitro in hippocampal neurons where excessive glutamate challenge potentiates p 75 NTR-dependent death signalling. We found that p 75 NTR expression in the mouse hippocampus is increased in vivo due to normal ageing and further increased in a transgenic mouse model of AD and in human AD post-mortem tissue. Finally, we report that in human post-mortem tissue, the levels of SDS-soluble AÎ² 42, p 75 NTR and GIRK proteins together accurately predicted clinically diagnosed cases of AD. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that AÎ² 42 activates p 75 NTR and upregulates GIRK channels which activated p 75 NTR uses to cause potassium efflux and cell death. By precipitating cellular dysregulation of calcium and subsequent inhibitory responses, AÎ² 42 provides both the impetus and the means for p 75 NTR death signalling. The p 75 NTR-GIRK channel death mechanism may provide a paradigm for understanding other forms of excitotoxic neurodegeneration...|$|E

The study was performed on 15 OXYS rats and 15 Wistar rats (as a control). After dislocation, brains were dissected, fixed with 10 % formalin, embedded in paraffin, and serially cut in coronal sections (5 Î¼m thickness). These sections were stained with Cresyl violet and examined with a photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Axiostar plus, Germany). The total number of hippocampal pyramidal cells in the CA 1, CA 3 and the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>regions</b> were estimated in 14 -dayold, 5 and 15 -month-old OXYS and Wistar rats (n = 5) on the 5 slices of each brain sections. The number of neurons with chromatolysis, hyperchromatic with darkly stained cytoplasm and shrunken neurons were calculated as degenerative neurons. The pictures obtained with the program Carl Zeiss Axio Vision 8. 0 with increasing 10 ï‚´ 100, determined the average area bodies and nuclei of neurons (mkm 2). The significant structural changes of neurons in the CA 1, CA 3 and <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>regions</b> of the hippocampus in OXYS rats at 5 month of age are revealed by light microscopy. This results indicates the early develop neurodegeneration in OXYS rats. The most pronounced morphological changes occur in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus of OXYS rats and irreversible.

The LTP deficit was correlated with impaired performance in a spatial working memory task in aged transgenics.

40|$|Background: Most {{in vitro}} neuroprotection studies with {{isoflurane}} have involved cells obtained during the embryonic or early postnatal period. However, in mature rodents, isoflurane neuroprotection does not persist. The authors determined whether neuroprotection of hippocampal slices with isoflurane decreases with aging and {{is due to}} decreased intracellular Ca 2 + regulation and survival protein phosphorylation. Methods: Hippocampal slices from 5 -day-old, 1 -month-old, and 19 - to 23 -month-old rats were deprived of oxygen and glucose for 5 - 30 min in media bubbled with 1 % isoflurane. Cell death was assessed in the CA 1, CA 3, and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions,</b> and intracellular Ca 2 + concentration was measured in CA 1 neurons. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) -dependent Ca 2 + influx was measured and the phosphorylation of NMDARs, and the survival proteins Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase p 42 / 44 were quantified. Results: Twenty minutes of oxygen and glucose deprivation killed approximately 40 - 60 % of neurons in CA 3 and dentate in all age groups. Isoflurane, 1 %, reduced death of CA 1, CA 3, and dentate neurons in slices from 5 -day-old rats but not those from 23 -month-old rats. In 5 -day slices, isoflurane attenuated NMDAR-mediated Ca 2 + influx, whereas in aging slices, Ca 2 + influx was increased protein kinase C. In aging slices, isoflurane did not increase the phosphorylation of Akt and p 42 / 44. Conclusions: Isoflurane neuroprotection of hippocampal slices during oxygen and glucose deprivation decreases with age. Isoflurane does not prevent large increases in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration during oxygen and glucose deprivation and does not induce the phosphorylation of the prosurvival proteins in aging slices. A protein kinase C-mediated increase in NMDAR activity may result in increased excitotoxicity and decreased neuroprotection by volatile anesthetics in the aging brain...|$|R
40|$|Chronic and {{intermittent}} {{alcohol consumption}} leads to cognitive impairment {{in the brain}} due to the ethanol's action on specific neurotransmitter systems and intricate signalling pathways. Glial cells actively participate in brain function by nurturing neurons and facilitating neuronal activity as well having an immunological role to protect brain cells from invading pathogens. Dysregulation of this immune function induced by intermittent alcohol abuse may shift the homeostatic balance of inflammatory mediators to a proinflammatory state, activating microglia and inducing neuronal loss thereby inducing behavioural and cognitive impairments. Molecules, which could prevent the microglial activation and cytokine production would downregulate the pro-inflammatory state and help to prevent the decline of cognitive impairment. Studies of a â€˜binge drinkingâ€™ adolescent female rats identified increased levels of glutamate in the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region</b> of the hippocampus, which were associated with activated microglia.

The present study aimed to examine whether repeated betamethasone treatment alters the expression of the key-rate limiting enzyme, 5 Î±-reductase, in the synthetic pathway of the potent neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in the brain and placenta and whether this effect is potentiated in growth restricted foetuses. To investigate this, pregnant guinea pigs carrying either control (sham surgery) or growth-restricted foetuses were treated with vehicle or betamethasone (1 mg/kg/day) for 4 days prior to sacrifice (65 d). Placental insufficiency was induced by the ablation of uterine artery branches supplying each placenta at mid gestation, resulting in foetal growth restriction characterised by â€˜brain sparingâ€™. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine relative 5 Î±-reductase type 1 and 2 mRNA expression in the placenta and brain. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the subcortical white matter, CA 1 and <b>dentate</b> <b>regions</b> of the hippocampus. 5 Î±-reductase type 2 mRNA expression in the brain was markedly reduced by betamethasone treatment in male foetuses compared to vehicle-treated controls but not in female foetuses.

Intrauterine growth restriction and betamethasone treatment reduced GFAP expression in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus in the brains of male but not female foetuses.

These results suggest that TANC 1 is important for dendritic spine maintenance and spatial memory, and implicate TANC 2 in embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} in {{the brain}} is found {{in a range of}} neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. We have recently shown that analogues of the glucagon-like polypeptide 1 (GLP- 1) such as liraglutide have potent neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We also found a reduction of activated microglia {{in the brain}}. This finding suggests that GLP- 1 analogues such as liraglutide have anti-inflammatory properties. To further characterise this property, we tested the effects of liraglutide on the chronic inflammation response induced by exposure of the brain to 6 Gy (X-ray). Animals were injected i. p. with 25 nmol/kg once daily for 30 days. Brains were analysed for cytokine levels, activated microglia and astrocyte levels, and nitrite levels as a measure for nitric oxide production and protein expression of iNOS. Exposure of the brain to 6 Gy induced a pronounced chronic inflammation response in the brain. The activated microglia load in the cortex and <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region</b> of hippocampus (...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPreterm infants undergo several painful {{procedures}} {{during their}} stay in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. Previous studies suggest that early painful experiences may {{have an impact on}} brain development. Here, we used an animal model to investigate the effect of neonatal pain on the generation of new neurons in the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region</b> of the hippocampus. Rat pups received intraplantar injections of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), a painful inflammatory agent, on either P 1 or P 8 and were sacrificed on P 22. We found that rat pups injected with CFA on P 8 had more BrdU-labeled cells and a higher density of cells expressing doublecortin (DCX) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. No change in BrdU-labeling or DCX expression was observed in pups injected with CFA on P 1. These findings indicate that neonatal pain can increase hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that early painful experiences may shape brain development and thereby influence behavioral outcome...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNFÎ±) is a cytokine produced {{mainly by}} {{cells of the}} immune system. It is also expressed by brain neurons and glia. The physiological role of TNFÎ± in the brain is not yet fully clear. Using TNFÎ±-deficient mice, we have examined its role in hippocampal development and function. We report here that TNFÎ± {{is involved in the}} regulation of morphological development in the hippocampus. TNFÎ±-deficient mice exhibited an accelerated maturation of the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region</b> and smaller dendritic trees in CA 1 and CA 3 regions in young mouse. In addition to its involvement in hippocampal morphogenesis, TNFÎ± deficiency specifically improved performance of affected mice in behavioral tasks related to spatial memory. Moreover, lack of TNFÎ± increased the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), following performance of the learning task. Our results suggest that TNFÎ± actively influences hippocampal development and function. In adult mice, TNFÎ± may interfere with memory consolidation, perhaps by regulating NGF levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational model of encoding and separation of episodic events via <b>Dentate</b> Gyrus sub <b>region</b> of hippocampus. The proposed model is implemented using {{adaptive resonance theory}} (ART) neural network. The model incorporates the proposed method encoding of episodes in binary patterns. The proposed model is capable of achieving high level of pattern encoding and separation. The separation achieved for different episodes and events shown by the results are very good depending upon the vigilance parameter of the model. Vigilance parameter {{is assumed to be}} correlated to attention attribute while perceiving an episode of an event. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{sub-chronic}} {{administration of}} phencyclidine to the rat brings about enduring pathophysiological and cognitive changes that resemble some features of schizophrenia. The present study aimed {{to determine whether}} the behavioural consequence of this phencyclidine regime extends to a long-term disruption of social interaction that might provide a parallel with some negative symptoms of the disease. Rats were treated with phencyclidine (2 mg/kg bi-daily for 1 week) or vehicle followed by a drug-free period. Social interaction was assessed 24 h, 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment. A long-lasting disturbance of social behaviour was observed in the phencyclidine group, namely more contact and non-contact interaction with an unfamiliar target rat at all time points. Six weeks post-phencyclidine, analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus with significant reductions localised to the CA 1 and <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>regions.</b> These results show that sub-chronic phencyclidine produces long-lasting disruptions in social interaction that, however, do not model the social withdrawal seen in patients with schizophrenia. These disturbances of social behaviour may be associated with concurrent pathophysiological brain changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract LRRC 4, leucine-rich repeat C 4 protein, {{has been}} {{identified}} in human (GenBank accession No. AF 196976), mouse (GenBank accession No. DQ 177325), rat (GenBank accession No. DQ 119102) and bovine (GenBank accession No. DQ 164537) with identical domains. In terms of their similarity, the genes encoding LRRC 4 in these four mammalian species are orthogs and therefore correspond to the same gene entity. Based on previous research, and using in situ hybridization, we found that LRRC 4 had the strongest expression in hippocampal CA 1 and CA 2, the granule cells of the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region,</b> the mediodoral thalamic nucleus, and cerebella Purkinje cell layers. Using a P 19 cell model, {{we also found that}} LRRC 4 participates in the differentiation of neuron and glia cells. In addition, extracellular proteins containing both an LRR cassette and immunoglobulin domains have been shown to participate in axon guidance. Our data from neurite outgrowth assays indicated that LRRC 4 promoted neurite extension of hippocampal neurons, and induced differentiation of glioblastoma U 251 cells into astrocyte-like cells, confirmed by morpholog...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} classical eyeblink conditioning in {{a relatively}} rare patient, B. R., with extensive cerebellar cortical atrophy and marked sparing of the dentate nucleus. Patient B. R. 's ability to acquire and extinguish simple associations (delay and trace conditioning tasks) {{as well as her}} ability to acquire more complex associations (temporal and simple discrimination tasks) were examined. There are 2 primary findings from this study. First, B. R. showed normal acquisition and extinction in delay and trace conditioning. Second, she demonstrated a complete inability to learn associative discriminations, even {{in the case of a}} simple 2 -tone discrimination within the context of a delay paradigm. The latter finding was unexpected because of the sparing of her deep cerebellar nuclei. These data suggest that the cerebellar cortex, or pathways traversing cerebellar cortex, play an important role in classical eyeblink discrimination learning. Lesion studies in both animals and humans have con-firmed that the associative learning of conditioned responses (CRs) in eyeblink conditioning is dependent on the lateral cerebellar cortex, the lateral interpositus-medial <b>dentate</b> nuclear <b>region,</b> and the superior cerebellar peduncle (Mc...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been focused on {{anatomical}} and functional differentiation of the hippocampus. Hippocampus, {{as one of the most}} studied structures in the brain has an irreplaceable role in encoding, consolidation and recall of memories. In the early 20 th century, Ramon y Cajal has divided hippocampus into 3 subregions, Ammon's horn (CA 1 -CA 3 <b>region),</b> <b>dentate</b> gyrus and subiculum. Diferences in gene expresion, principal cell features and organization of connections with other structures suggests further division of the hippocampus according to septo-temporal axis, into ventral, dorsal and intermedial zone. Most importantly, the efects of impairment or inactivation of the individual subregions of the hippocampus, allow us to determine their prospective functions...|$|R
40|$|Dissociated hippocampal neurons {{exposed to}} a variety of {{degenerative}} stimuli form neuritic cofilin-actin rods. Here we report on stimulus driven regional rod formation in organotypic hippocampal slices. Ultrastructural analysis of rods formed in slices demonstrates mitochondria and vesicles become entrapped within some rods. We developed a template for combining and mapping data from multiple slices, enabling statistical analysis for the identification of vulnerable sub-regions. Amyloid-beta (A beta) induces rods predominantly in the <b>dentate</b> gyrus <b>region,</b> and A beta-induced rods are reversible following washout. Rods that persist 24 h following transient (30 min) ATP-depletion are broadly distributed, whereas rods formed in response to excitotoxic glutamate localize within and nearby the pyramidal neurons. Time-lapse imaging of cofilin-GFP-expressing neurons within slices shows neuronal rod formation begins rapidly and peaks by 10 min of anoxia. In similar to 50 % of responding neurons, A beta-induced rod formation acts via cdc 42, an upstream regulator of cofilin. These new observations support a role for cofilin-actin rods in stress-induced disruption of cargo transport and synaptic function within hippocampal neurons and suggest both cdc 42 -depedent and independent pathways modulate cofilin activity downstream from A beta...|$|R
