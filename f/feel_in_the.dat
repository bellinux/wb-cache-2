5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to <b>feel)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E

[...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t <b>feel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito...

But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1961 the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who {{is credited}} with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English {{groups such as the}} Shadows. The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction. Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly <b>feel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Perkins. Within this framework he often used syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] and [...] "Too Much Monkey Business". Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on [...] "I'll Be on My Way". He {{was the first person to}} own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings. His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day's Night helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles' [...] "secret weapon".|$|E
500|$|In {{his film}} debut Primal Fear (1996), Norton played Aaron Stampler, an altar boy who {{is charged with}} the murder of a Roman Catholic {{archbishop}} and is defended by Martin Vail (Richard Gere). The film is an adaptation of William Diehl's novel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Norton gives a performance that's fully the equal of Gere's – he's as slyly self-effacing as Gere is slyly ostentatious." [...] Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, in review of the film, wrote, [...] "Norton's performance and the well-paced tension preceding the movie's climactic sequence provide an entertaining if slightly predictable thriller." [...] Despite the mixed reviews, Norton won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. That same year, Norton played lawyer Alan Isaacman in The People vs. Larry Flynt. In 1998, he played Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi, in the film American History X, David Denby of The New Yorker noted that he gives Derek [...] "ambiguous erotic allure; he's almost appealing". The film received positive reviews and grossed over $23 million worldwide at the box office. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Later, Norton starred with Matt Damon in Rounders, which follows two friends who urgently need to earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a huge debt. In David Fincher's 1999 film Fight Club, Norton played an unreliable narrator who feels trapped in his white-collar position. It is based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. To prepare for the role, Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo and grappling. Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. During promotion for the film, he said, [...] "I feel that Fight Club really, in a way... probed into the despair and paralysis that people <b>feel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of having inherited this value system out of advertising." [...] The film failed to meet expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from film critics. However, it became a cult classic after its DVD release.|$|E
