5|$|In 2007, General Electric's Chief Engineer {{predicted}} <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> without subsidies in sunny {{parts of}} the United States by around 2015; other companies predicted an earlier date: the cost of solar power will be below <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> {{for more than half}} of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the OECD, as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010.|$|E
5|$|The first {{places to}} reach <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> were {{those with high}} {{traditional}} electricity prices {{and high levels of}} solar radiation. Currently, more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve <b>grid</b> <b>parity.</b> This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015 {{solar power}} {{suddenly}} demonstrated a possible {{way through the}} impasse. The continued fall in prices for solar systems and Spain's abundant sunshine led to prices for solar power reaching <b>grid</b> price <b>parity.</b> Suddenly there was the potential for sustained and spontaneous growth in solar installations in Spain as households and producers could produce power more economically. However the Spanish government introduced what has been dubbed the world's first [...] "sun tax" [...] on solar installations making them economically less viable as well as draconian fines (up to 60 million Euros) for anyone not complying with the tax.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} reached <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> (the {{point at}} which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources) in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and {{it has been suggested that}} it has reached general <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail <b>grid</b> <b>parity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> of currencies' par values. The <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|R

25|$|A grid (known as the <b>Parity</b> <b>Grid)</b> of {{bilateral}} rates was calculated {{on the basis}} of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and currency fluctuations had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%). Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.|$|R
5|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>parity,</b> {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
25|$|Widespread <b>grid</b> <b>parity,</b> {{the point}} at which {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than grid power without subsidies, likely requires advances on all three fronts.

Rising inventory {{levels of}} Solar panels and new production capacity is driving solar PV prices lower and thereby, bringing solar energy closer to <b>grid</b> price <b>parity.</b> Major {{studies have been}} made in improving solar cell efficiency. A novel approach based on three-dimensional (3 D) architecture for polymeric photovoltaic cells made up of an array of sub-micron and nano-pillars which not only increase the area of the light absorbing surface, but also improve the carrier collection efficiency of bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells. This study concentrates on modeling the effect of shading on 3 D solar cell by varying arrangements of pillars/electrodes on a 3 D organic photovoltaic cell surface. We have developed mathematical model in MATLAB which simulate the shadow effect and characterize the cell geometrically by varying aspect ratio, spacing, size, shape.

40|$|By {{the early}} 1960 s, {{outstanding}} U. S. dollar liabilities began {{to exceed the}} U. S. gold stock, suggesting that the United States could not completely maintain its pledge to convert dollars into gold at the official price. This raised uncertainty about the Bretton Woods <b>parity</b> <b>grid,</b> and speculation seemed to grow. In response, the Federal Reserve instituted a series of swap lines to provide central banks with cover for unwanted, but temporary accumulations of dollars and to provide foreign central banks with dollar funds to finance their own interventions. The Treasury also began intervening in the market. The operations often forestalled gold losses, but in so doing, delayed the need to solve Bretton Woods’ fundamental underlying problems. In addition, the institutional arrangements forged between the Federal Reserve and the U. S. Treasury raised important questions bearing on Federal Reserve independence. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a local level}} study of a village off-grid system in Bangladesh. It applies an integrated methodology that identifies the demand in the off-grid village context using alternative scenarios. The techno-economic analysis of the optimal off-grid system architecture is then presented using HOMER software. Three energy resources are considered, namely solar energy, wind and diesel fuel. The optimal configuration suggested for the scenarios consists of diesel generators for the basic level of demand and PV-diesel hybrid for higher demand and reliable supply scenarios. The cost of electricity per kWh remains high for the basic level of supply and decreases as the system size increases. However, the capital and asset replacement costs increased considerably for bigger systems. The business case is then analysed for each scenario and {{it was found that}} it is practically impossible to reach <b>grid</b> price <b>parity</b> even with full capital cost subsidy, indicating significant amount of operating cost subsidy requirement that makes the larger systems financially unsustainable. Moreover, the small mini-grid system for the basic level of supply emerges as a cheaper option than providing the consumers with solar home systems. But the monthly electricity bill will become unaffordable for most consumers when demand restrictions are removed. Accordingly, the paper suggests a mini-grid based electricity supply to provide the basic level of provision alongside productive energy use during off-peak hours as the starting point. If the business develops and the demand improves, the system can be expanded subsequently using appropriate technology combinations...|$|R
25|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>parity</b> (or socket parity) {{occurs when}} an {{alternative}} energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost (LCoE) that is {{less than or equal}} to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid.

40|$|A techno-economic {{feasibility}} of a stand-alone hybrid power generation for a remote community in Bangladesh {{is carried out}} in this study. The proposed system integrates a combination of biogas generator, PV modules, diesel generators, wind turbines, and lead acid battery to meet the electric load requirements using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software tool. The designated system would satisfy the energy requirements of 248 kWh/day primary load with 44. 41 kW peak load. The optimized hybrid system consists of a biogas generator (9 kW), PV modules (10 kW), 2 diesel generators (10 kW each), 72 batteries (390 Ah each), and 15 kW inverters. This configuration gives the COE of $ 0. 28 /kWh and total Net Present Cost (NPC) of $ 612280 with a renewable fraction of 60 %. Additionally, the system has potential benefit to reduce CO 2 emission by nearly 59. 6 % per year as compared to a diesel-based system and by 40. 5 % compared to the grid electricity. Furthermore, the results also indicate that it is fairly impossible to reach <b>grid</b> electricity price <b>parity</b> even with full government support for the project capital cost.

40|$|The {{political}} economy of E. M. S. The economic issues underlying Britain's decision not to join the EMS at its inception are analysed. Technical difficulties {{were the most important}} factor in the short term. Britain had been following a successful policy of stabilising the effective rate whilst the Dollar and Deutschemark diverged. Opposition to the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> system reflected the fear of a bias toward devaluation and/or deflation within Europe. Most economists stress the likely conflict between domestic policy objectives and EMS. Sortie focussed on the implied loss of monetary control and adjudtment costs. Others pointed to the likely loss of competitiveness and squeeze on profits. The crucial issues are difficult to resolve empirically. In the U. K. EMS tended to be seen as a move towards Monetary Union. Longer term issues are analysed in terms of the regional analogy. A country could face a « regional » type problem if it became uncompetitive. Costs of monetary union seem small if a country is already, in effect, a region of a larger area. Alternatively if real wages and competitiveness are unaffected by the exchange rate (as assumed by international monetarist there may be little loss. The costs may be large if neither of these spécial cases applies. For a low productivity country the costs may be balanced from integration if it is initially competitive and can remain so. A final section summarises the posotion of the U. K. vis a vis EMS and compares it with other European countries. A l'inverse, si les salaires réels et la compétitivité ne sont pas affectés par le taux de change (comme le présument les monétaristes internationaux), la perte pourrait n'être que minime. Les coûts pourraient être élevés en dehors de ces cas particuliers. Pour un pays à basse productivité, les coûts pourraient être équilibrés grâce à l'intégration si ce pays est initialement compétitif et peut le devenir.

40|$|When the 1987 general {{elections}} brought a durable government to Portugal, the national environment was still inflationary. Nevertheless, {{thanks to the}} efforts of successive ministers of finance/central bank governor pairs, the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) were met and the seventh pair saw the euro conversion rate be set at 200 escudos. The agreed rate represents a depreciation of some 16 % over the one at which the escudo entered the ECU basket in 1989. As the change in regime towards stability-oriented macroeconomic policies was completed when the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System (ERM) was under severe stress, escudo depreciations were agreed upon at realignments initiated by the peseta. The understanding by the Portuguese authorities of the ERM code of conduct as they prepared to join after the 1991 {{general elections}} made it possible to acquire financial reputation very quickly. But the enhanced national credibility abroad caused tension within several minister/governor pairs, especially with respect to the timing of ERM entry, the speed at which to move to full currency convertibility and whether the escudo should respond to peseta realignments. Moreover, both the opposition and the governing party initially resisted the stability-oriented policy, stalling structural reforms and allowing the opposition to win the 1995 general elections on a reformist platform. As a consequence, the stability-oriented policy was maintained until EMU qualification but there were no other major reforms, rasing the threat of a "euro hold-up". The weekly escudo-DMark rate reveals widely different volatility states which were accompanied by six successive exchange rate regimes. Before entering the ERM, a crawling peg was discreetly replaced by DMark shadowing with reinforced controls on capital inflows at the beginning of first stage of EMU. Yet, the escudo-DMark rate, even allowing for the last realignment, was more stable in the ERM than when it was inconvertible and the central bank controlled the currency. The comparison excludes the subperiod of crises before widening the bands and the one after volatility in prospective EMU qualifying currencies subsided. Markov switching autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (SWARCH) models with more than three states capture all regimes. The specification with five states is favored because it suggests the nature of the response of the central bank to speculative attacks during the crises regime.
