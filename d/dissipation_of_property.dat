40|$|After the precipitated {{decline of}} the Soviet Empire and its {{satellite}} states, a system change seemed to be called for, and many countries embarked on social and political reforms focussing on property structures in the economy. This {{raised the issue of}} governance in the institutions that would constitute the structures in which production would have to take place. In particular, some Central European countries opted for mass privatisations of the means of production, {{on the face of it}} so as to have the people participate in the wealth of the nation. In fact, the wealth of the nation depends on the structures in which it is constituted. <b>Dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights will reduce the value of the nation's productive capital, whereas an intelligent structure that creates good governance structures at the same time, increases the value of the producing capital. This relatively simple insight lies at the heart of our understanding of how to analyse different processes of mass privatisation. This essay develops a theoretical framework by which different governance structures can be analysed. The framework consists of a blend of the economic theory of property rights, new institutional economics and Austrian economic theory.

40|$|European {{agriculture}} is undergoing major institutional changes, which are of great relevance {{to our understanding}} of the role of agriculture in rural development. They are also taking place in contexts in which agricultural development seems to be continuing within the traditional modernisation paradigm. This is the case for agriculture in Spain. The authors develop a theoretical scheme based on the concepts of institutional transactions and institutional arrangements which may be relevant across a variety of contexts. This approach is applied through an analysis of Spanish agriculture, concentrating on (a) changes introduced through the regulation of the environmental impacts of agriculture, (b) new schemes for the control of food quality and altered relations in the food-marketing chains, and (c) shifts deriving from changes to the major support mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Spanish {{agriculture is}} becoming increasingly embedded in the food-production process, and this is associated with a <b>dissipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights from the production sector. The analysis illustrates the usefulness of the approach, although identification of the specific nature of some institutional transactions remains uncertain. Applications in other countries and at more local levels will facilitate regional and international comparisons of the restructuring processes underway in differing contexts. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} time {{integration}} for the second-order Maxwell equations with possibly non-zero conductivity {{in the context}} of the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DG-FEM) and the H(curl) -conforming FEM. For the spatial discretisation, hierarchic H(curl) -conforming basis functions are used up to polynomial order p = 3 over tetrahedral meshes, meaning fourth-order convergence rate. A high-order polynomial basis often warrants the use of high-order time-integration schemes, but many well-known high-order schemes may suffer from a severe time-step stability restriction owing to the conductivity term. We investigate several possible time-integration methods from the point of view of accuracy, stability and computational work. We also carry out a numerical Fourier analysis to study the dispersion and <b>dissipation</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the semi-discrete DG-FEM scheme as well as the fully-discrete schemes with several of the time-integration methods.

We investigate the well posedness of the stationary linear Boltzmann equation with space periodic electric field. We discuss the different behaviors that occur depending if the average electric field vanishes or not. The existence follows by perturbation techniques and stability arguments under uniform a priori estimates. The uniqueness of the weak solution holds for space periodic electric fields with non vanishing average, under the constraint of given current.
