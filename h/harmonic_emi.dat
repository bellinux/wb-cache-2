40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an active filter topology {{to improve the}} perfor-mance of hysteresis direct torque control (HDTC) of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM). The filter topology consists of an active filter and two RLC filters, and {{is connected to the}} main power circuit through a 1 : 1 trans-former. The active filter is characterized by detecting the harmonics in the motor phase voltages and injecting equivalent harmonic voltages to produce almost sinu-soidal voltage waveform to the motor terminals. The active filter uses hysteresis voltage controller while the motor main circuit uses hysteresis direct torque con-trol. The simulation results of this combined control structure show considerable torque ripple reduction in the steady state range and adequate dynamic torque per-formance as well as considerable <b>harmonic</b> voltage and <b>EMI</b> noise reduction...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{developments}} of IGBT technology, switching time and frequency are dramatically increased. At higher carrier frequencies, IGBTs induce more capacitive coupled current into a rotor and a stator frame {{and lead to}} faster bearing damage. Common mode voltage enables motor to create shaft voltage through electrostatic couplings between the rotor and the stator windings and between the rotor and the frame, and it can caused bearing currents when the shaft voltage exceeds a breakdown voltage level of the bearing grease. Also, high frequency leakage current occurs through stray capacitors between stator winding and the motor frame due to {{a high rate of}} the common mode dv/dt at motor terminals which can produce induced shaft voltage. Conducted and radiated Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) emissions are major problems in recent motor drives that produce undesirable effects on electronic devices. In modern power electronic systems, increasing power density and decreasing cost and size of system are market requirements. Switching losses, <b>Harmonics</b> and <b>EMI</b> are the key factors which should be considered at the beginning stage of a design to optimise a drive system. In most of power electronic designs, EMI issues have not been taken into account as one of the main factors; and mitigation techniques for EMI are considered at the last stage of design.

40|$|Limiting {{harmonics}} in the conducted {{noise of}} switch mode power supplies is very important, but finding {{the causes of}} harmonics {{to get the best}} solution to the electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem is often complex. A new tool for the search of conducted noise causes is presented: the more significant <b>harmonics</b> in the <b>EMI</b> receiver measurement are searched in the time evolution of the line impedance stabilization network (LISN) voltage by using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). In the time frames where the harmonics are present, similar harmonic contents are searched for in the waveforms of the circuit, because these are the causes of the conducted noise. An example of application is described: signals of a boost PFC are processed in different ways to be compared to the EMI receiver measurements of LISN voltage spectrum.

Abstract-The {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) strategy employed in the voltage source inverter (VSI) not only control {{the magnitude of the}} output voltage but also the quality. Performance evaluations of such strategies are done in terms of fundamental voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD), switching losses etc. (primary indices) and also in terms of acoustic noise, electromagnetic interference (<b>EMI),</b> <b>harmonic</b> spread factor, distribution of harmonic power etc. (secondary indices). Multilevel inverter (MLI) has become unanimous choice in medium and high power applications due to their superior performance compared to three level inverters. The conventional Sub-Harmonic PWM (SHPWM) scheme and its variations offer the output voltage spectrum with high intensity harmonic components around the switching frequency; it will end with cluster harmonic with high acoustic noise.

The conventional line commutated ac-to-dc inverters have square-shaped line current which contains higher-order harmonics. The line current with the high <b>harmonic</b> contents generates <b>EMI</b> and moreover it causes more heating of the core of distribution/power transformers. Alternatively, PWM based inverters using MOSFET/IGBT switches are also used for the same purpose.

Permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDCM) is used in air-conditioning systems and runs at rated torque and variable speed to achieve energy conservation. The analysis, design and performance of the proposed PFC converter is carried out for a 1. 2 kW, 1200 rpm, 164 V PMBLDCM used in air-conditioning system. The PFC converter is modeled and its performance is simulated in Matlab-Simulink environment. The improved power factor of the drive is evaluated in wide range. Keywords arise at input AC mains including poor power factor, increased total harmonic distortion (THD) and high crest factor (CF) of AC mains current etc. So, PMBLDCM drives having inherent {{power factor correction}} (PFC) become the preferred choice for the Air-Cons. The PFC converter draws sinusoidal current from AC mains in phase with its voltage. In this PFC converter a DC-DC converter topology is mostly used amongst several available topologies e. g. boost, buckboost, Cuk, SEPIC, zeta converters with variations of capacitive/inductive energy transfer.

Any DC-DC converters {{can be used for}} this purpose, if a suitable control method is used to shape its input current or if it has inherent PFC properties. Also, there exist several advantages to parallel-connected DC-DC converters, including increased reliability, decreased stress on critical components, improved efficiency, and more flexibility. In this project, a control technique for parallel-connected boost converter is proposed. This is an active-control scheme in which we force the current in one converter to follow that of the other. This approach is based on phase shifting of two boost converters connected in parallel and working at the same switching frequency.

40|$|Abstract — The {{conventional}} line commutated ac-to-dc converters / inverters have square-shaped line current which contains higher-order harmonics. Moreover, {{it requires a}} costly and bulky dc inductor or choke. The line current with the high <b>harmonic</b> contents generates <b>EMI</b> and therefore it causes more heating of the core of distribution or power transformers. Alternatively, PWM based inverters using MOSFET/IGBT switches {{can be used for}} the above purpose. However, apart from higher switching losses, the power handling capability and reliability of these devices are quite low in comparison to thyristors / SCR. A thyristor based forced commutated inverters are not suitable for PWM applications due to the problems of commutation circuits. A pure sinusoidal voltage output or waveform with low harmonic contents is most desirable in the conversion from dc to ac. In the present work, a novel two pulse line commutated inverter is been proposed with control signal generated from PIC 16 F 877 A. It improves the wave shape hence it reduces the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid interactive-inverter. The simulation of the circuit is done using SIMULINK. Moreover, the performance of the proposed circuitry is far better than the {{conventional line}}-commutated inverter.
