40|$|Homophone effects {{had always}} been found <b>for</b> Japanese <b>homophones</b> with a single mate, but not for those with {{multiple}} mates. Mizuno and Matsui (2016), by controlling their phonological familiarities, found larger <b>homophone</b> effects <b>for</b> multiple-mate <b>homophones</b> than <b>for</b> single-mate <b>homophones,</b> and suggested that the high phonological familiarities of the former might shorten their lexical decision times. However, if phonological familiarity were a unique facilitative factor, Japanese would be regarded as an inefficient language, as Japanese has many homophones with multiple mates, and their phonological familiarities are not always high. Because Japanese is a high-context language (Hall, 1976), we contend that context should facilitate <b>homophone</b> processing, even <b>for</b> <b>homophones</b> with low phonological familiarity. In this experiment, the lexical decision times of multiple-mate homophones with high and low phonological familiarities were measured in with- and withoutcontext conditions. Homophone effects were found <b>for</b> <b>homophones</b> with low phonological familiarity in the without-context condition, but not for either high- or low-familiarity homophones in the withcontext condition. These results indicated that contexts have robust facilitative effects on Japanese homophone processing...|$|R
