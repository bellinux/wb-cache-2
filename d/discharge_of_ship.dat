50|$|Incorporated in 1854 as a {{cooperative}} {{in the port}} of Antwerp (Belgium), the original activities of Katoen Natie consisted of typical wharfingers activities: the reception and handling of goods on the docks, especially cotton - hence the ‘Katoen’ in the name- and other commodities such as jute, coffee, cocoa, wool, rubber, aluminum. The wharfinger (Natie) traditionally formed {{the link between the}} stevedoring (loading and <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships)</b> and transport activities to and from the hinterland.|$|R
50|$|Ports must {{smoothly}} coordinate ships reaching port, {{departing from}} port {{as well as}} the loading and <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in relation to inbound and outbound transportation. This means that sea voyages must be in synchronization with port operations such that ship arrivals can be accurately predicted and prepared for. In STM the ambition is to enable this level of operation coordination by improving situational awareness through information sharing. The information needed may be included in the standardized route exchange protocol developed.|$|R

50|$|Although {{cargo of}} this sort can be {{delivered}} straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock {{in advance of the}} arrival <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and for the cargo to be stored in warehouses. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the quay and then lifted on board by either the ship's gear (derricks or cranes) or by the dockside cranes. The <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> is the reverse of the loading operation.|$|R
50|$|The Shipping Master is an {{official}} appointment by the Government, who presides over the signing-on and <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> seamen from <b>ships.</b> The Shipping Master {{is also the}} issuing authority for the Seaman Service Book to the Merchant Navy officers.

50|$|The United States {{is similar}} to many {{countries}} which permit the spreading of cremation ashes within their Exclusive Economic zone - when spreading ashes from a ship which is registered in a different country, the regulations and reporting procedures for the ships flag state need to be complied with once the vessel is in international waters, that is, outside 12 nautical miles.Ships follow the London convention principles, as opposed to MARPOL regulations, as the ash is intentionally taken on board for discharge at sea, as opposed to ash generated on passage from the ship's incinerators. It should be further considered that on 1 January 2013, MARPOL Annex V came into force, which prevents <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship's</b> incinerator ash.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. In {{an attempt}} to deal uniformly with several complex and {{delicate}} legal issues that have divided the seafaring {{nations of the world}} {{for most of the last}} century, the Rotterdam Rules 2009 (hereafter: RR) introduce the concept of the “maritime performing party”. This is a person other than the carrier who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the arrival of the goods at the port of loading <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> and their departure from the port <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship.</b> Pursuant to articles 19 and 20 RR, the maritime performing party may be held liable jointly and severally with the contractual carrier for cargo loss or damage or delay in delivery which occurred (basically) be-cause of his own doing or during the time that the cargo was in his care...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid 1970 's the {{production}} of bivalve shellfish in Ireland has increased annually to a present level of some 17, 000 tonnes. Several problems limit the continued expansion of the industry, most notably the problem of natural biotoxins. These toxins are accumulated in the product by the ingestion of toxic phytoplankton. This causes no obvious ill effects to the shellfish themselves but upon consumption may be transferred to human or other vertebrate consumers causing illness and sometimes death. In Ireland {{the most common of}} the toxins are those associated with Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) which causes diarrhoea. Other more serious toxins which to date have not been confirmed in Ireland are those associated with Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) which causes paralysis or even death and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) which causes short term memory loss. Of the phytoplankton species which can result in toxicity, under both bloom and non bloom conditions, the dinoflagellates play an important role. Many of these dinoflagellates have been shown to include a dormant benthic cyst stage in their life cycle. Therefore {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics of toxic events may be obtained by studying the distribution and abundance of benthic cysts. There is growing international concern about the transport of harmful aquatic organisms, including cysts, into new areas via the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> ballast water. Also, as a result of EC directive 91 / 67 /EEC permitting the free movement of shellfish between EU member states there is now increasing concern in Ireland that harmful cysts may be introduced with shipments of imported shellfish. Little research has been carried out on the distribution of dinoflagellate cysts in Irish marine sediments. In this paper preliminary results of a study designed to map the distribution and undertake taxonomic studies on dinoflagellate and other cysts in Ireland are presented and discussed. Also presented are the results of the examination of cysts associated with imported shellfish...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{provisions}} of the Rotterdam Rules 2009 relating to the performing party in general and the maritime performing party in particular. Performing party means a person who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations under a contract of carriage with respect to the receipt, loading, handling, stowage, carriage, keeping, care, unloading or delivery of the goods, to the extent that such person acts, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or under the carrier’s supervision or control. Maritime performing party means a performing party who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the arrival of goods at the port of loading and their departure from the port <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship.</b> The maritime performing party is a new concept introduced by the Rotterdam Rules. The central intention {{of this paper is to}} study and analyse the concept, legal standing and liability of a maritime performing party under the Rotterdam Rules. A comparative analysis of the legal standing of persons analogous to the performing party in conventions regulating the carriage of goods by sea is also provided...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} comply fully with the {{discharge}} requirements {{set out in}} the MARPOL 73 / 78 Convention depends upon the availability of adequate facilities on land for the reception of shipgenerated waste. This paper considers ways of ensuring adequate provision of reception facilities, and discusses the approach taken by the UK {{to reduce the amount of}} pollution entering the marine environment from the deliberate <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> waste from <b>ships.</b> Arguably, the most significant of the measures adopted by the UK is the requirement for all ports and harbours to prepare port waste management plans. Disincentives to the use of port waste reception facilities are examined, together with the benefits and shortcomings of various financing arrangements, and compulsory <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> waste in ports. The paper concludes that the statutory approach to improving the provision and use of waste facilities should be supported by an appropriate awareness campaign to educate shipowners about the need to discharge waste legally to port reception facilities.
