40|$|This {{study is}} about the types and {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech produced by Leopold in Kate and Leopold movie. The writer wants {{to find out the}} kind <b>of</b> Leopold?s <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech in his utterances and also to analyze the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech itself. The writer uses Perrine?s theory to analyzing types <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and Searle?s theory to analyzing the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech. The writer describes this research design, in this case, the approach of the study and how she collects and analyzes the data. She uses qualitative approach as the method of the study. The analysis itself consists of choosing the type <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech, deciding the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and mapping both of them into a table. From the findings, the writer may infer several points. From the findings, {{it can be seen that}} the most dominated <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that Leopold used are simile and hyperbole. Moreover, the highest number <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that can be seen in this study is hyperbole; it can be meant that the movie writer likes to express his message with exaggerated words. From the language function, the writer found that in this study the most dominated language function is expressive types. It can be conclude that <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech can be used to express feeling that can not or hard to explain through ordinary sentence. <b>Figure</b> <b>of</b> speech also helps to make the function of a sentence clearer and stronger...|$|R
