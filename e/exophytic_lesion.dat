40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the reasons for failure in clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic diagnoses as well as their interactions with each other. Methods: Personal information and lesion characteristics of 51 patients with central or peripheral <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were collected in Mashhad dental school. Specialists determined clinical and radiographic diagnoses and after taking biopsy, the clinical and radiographic diagnoses were compared with histopathologic diagnosis. Results: Fifty three patients with oral <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were evaluated among which 66. 6 % were peripheral and 33. 4 % were central <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Males constituted 52. 9 % of the patients while 47. 1 % were female. The first clinical and radiographic diagnoses were not confirmed with the histopathologic diagnosis in some patients. 80. 4 % of the first clinical diagnoses were consistent with the pathologic reports and in other cases, the clinical diagnosis were not confirmed histopathologically. In addition, radiographic diagnoses in six patients were not consistent with pathologic diagnosis.

40|$|Background and aims. Histpathologic {{diagnosis}} of <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> is occasionally influenced by clinical and radiographic diagnosis {{and even the}} surgeon’s observation during biopsy. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cases with failure in clinical diagnosis. &# 13; Materials and methods. A total of 73 patients with peripheral <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were evaluated in Zahedan Faculty of Dentistry in 2006. Specialists gave their differential diagnoses based on the criteria of oral medicine texts. Then a biopsy was taken and the histopathologic diagnosis was determined. Finally, consistency rates of clinical and histopathologic diagnoses were determined. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS software using Chi-Square and Fisher’s exact tests. &# 13; Results. In the present study 73 subjects with oral soft tissue (peripheral) <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were orally examined and biopsies were taken. Forty-four subjects (60. 35 %) were females and 29 (39. 7 %) were males. A total of 81. 7 % (62 subjects) of clinical diagnoses were consistent with histopathologic reports.

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} safety and technical efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of surface hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison to intraparenchymal HCC in cirrhotic patients. Materials and Methods: Surface lesions were defined as tumours located or reaching within 1 cm of liver capsule including <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Seventy-four surface HCC including 21 exophytic in 58 patients (surface group) and 60 intraparenchymal HCC in 54 patients (intraparenchymal group) measuring up to 4 cm in maximum extent underwent percutaneous [ultrasound (US) or computed tomography-guided (CT-guided) ] RFA. The response to the treatment was assessed by contrast enhanced CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of RFA and thereafter every 4 – 6 months. In case of features suggesting residual disease, a repeat RFA was performed. The technical success after single-session RFA, complications and disease recurrence rates were calculated and compared between two groups. Results: Technical success achieved after first session of RFA in surface HCC was 95 % (70 / 74) and intraparenchymal HCC was 97 % (58 / 60). Hundred percent secondary success rate was achieved in both groups after second repeat RFA in residual lesion. No major difference in complication and local recurrence rate in both group on follow-up in surface HCC and intraparenchymal HCC. No case of needle track, peritoneal seeding, and treatment mortality was found. Conclusions: The complication rate and efficacy of RFA for surface and exophytic HCC's were {{comparable to that of}} intraparenchymal HCC. Hence surface and <b>exophytic</b> <b>lesions</b> should not be considered a contraindication for RFA in cirrhotic patients...|$|R

Peripheral odontogenic fibroma (POdF) is characteristically described as a solitary neoplasm, and very few cases of diffuse peripheral odontogenic fibroma have been reported in literature.
