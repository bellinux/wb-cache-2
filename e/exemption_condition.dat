François Bart [URL] the 1980 's, {{starting from}} Kenyan, then spreading to neighboring countries, the rose industry has tremendously risen in East Africa which now supplies {{one third of}} the European and Russian markets. Originally, it was set up by Western companies in their search to escape high energy prices in post 1973 oil-shock Europe. Build upon foreign capital and know how, it targets equatorial highlands where it relies mainly on access to cheap land (whatever the origin is: whether colonial or postcolonial), exploitation of cheap salaries and quiet man power and free environmental services such as water, light and sun energy. It also relies on tax arrangements and <b>exemption.</b> One <b>condition</b> for such investments to be profitable is the proximity of a reliable international airport. With time, beside foreign investors, local investors have appeared. As a geographical result, the industry as a whole has built a hybrid structure: agriculturally oriented, morphologically and sociologically "rurban" and directly berthed to international metropolis with a smooth cool-chain. This type of structure seems quite new for Sub Saharan Africa. The paper will focus on describing the fabric of such new localized productive systems based on Eastern Africa examples.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the French word propre roughly meaning `characteristic-of' and corresponding to English own found in `her own thesis'. This adjective makes extremely varied and complex contributions to the meaning and properties of sentences it occurs in. The present work addresses {{the question of how}} these contributions arise. Parsimoniously assuming a unique lexical entry for propre, these contributions are compositionally derived by a specific DP-internal structure and different interactions with focus. More precisely, propre is analyzed as taking as argument a possessive relation characterized as most specific. Unlike postnominal propre, prenominal propre exhibits three main readings called restrictive, possessor and possessum propre : restrictive propre has a standard intersective truth-conditional effect; possessor and possessum propre do not, but induce focus alternatives respectively to the possessor and to the possessum; possessum propre moreover gives rise to scalarity effects. These readings are argued to derive from a principle of minimization and different interactions with focus; in particular, the behavior of possessum propre shows the presence of a covert focus operator akin to even. When combined with a pronominal possessor like son (`his'), the behavior of propre provides probes bearing on binding theoretic issues. First, son propre exhibits complex correlations between focus, locality and animacy: possessor propre is subject to locality only when it is inanimate, unlike possessum propre not so constrained. The difference between possessor and possessum propre underscores an interaction between focus and binding. Moreover, the distribution of possessor son propre sheds new light on how to formulate condition A supporting the relevance of local binding domain (for non-exempt anaphors) and the need for <b>exemption</b> (from <b>condition</b> A). As inanimate French anaphors like son propre are never exempt, they provide a crucial tool for delimiting locality, allowing a reduction of condition A (at least in French) to phase theory based architectural principles...|$|R

Kurtzman {{is often used to}} hold government benefits to religious organizations unconstitutional. But, in cases where the majority of the Court finds the governmental benefit permissible, Lemon is generally unmentioned. This problem is confounded when the Court considers accommodations for religious organizations. Lemon, without refinement, is ill-suited to application to such accommodations. Does allowing religious organizations an exemption from generally applicable laws benefit a religious organization in violation of the Establishment Clause or does failing to provide the accommodation violate the Free Exercise Clause and unduly punish religious organizations because of their message? This paper addresses these questions and presents a new, more coherent test for accommodations to religious organizations. Specifically, it looks at the employment practices of religious organizations participating in school choice programs to determine (1) is it constitutional for accommodations to be made to religious schools participating in the program, and (2) would it violate the Free Exercise clause to deny the accommodation in some circumstances. Finally, the paper asks if legislatures authorizing school voucher programs could constitutionally demand waiver of any <b>exemptions</b> as a <b>condition</b> on participation in the program...|$|R
40|$|Today {{we see a}} {{simplification}} in our landscapes; a globalisation {{of culture}} and landscape that has forced people {{into a state of}} disconnection with place. It has divided our world into culturally rich, and culturally absent worlds. Worlds where natural ecologies are seen as separate entities to the human cultures that live on the land. Our landscapes need to reconnect and adapt; not only to the ever increasingly culturally diverse world, but also to the site specific social and natural ecologies that exist. Wainuiomata is no <b>exemption</b> to this <b>condition.</b> Its suburban landscape is divided from the natural ecologies that lay dormant on its peripheries. It is an austere environment, but one with a colourful and culturally diverse community that is unable to express itself. This piece of research argues that landscape architecture has the ability to enable disadvantaged communities to rekindle a sense of connection with, and custodianship over their landscapes. It discusses ways of designing that can reform lost relationships between communities and the common ground they live upon. The work brings forward how landscapes can be designed in ways that provide opportunities not only for communities to self build their landscape, but also how the architect can create frameworks that facilitate a process of engagement at different scales. It further explores how a respect for ecological environments can be instilled into the community through building relationships between ecological and social environments, as opposed to their current segregation. Lastly, the thesis looks at how a landscape architect may design in a way that pushes beyond the final drawings. Doing this with an understanding that it is a curation of a process (one where communities can {{become a part of the}} making of a landscape) that will bring a sense of custodianship to its dwellers...|$|R

It {{is very important to}} note that non-profit {{organizations are}} often subject to various benefits that the for-profit companies are not. Thus, for example, preferential tax status of non-profit organizations is manifested primarily in the form of exemption from corporate income tax. In addition, private non-profit organizations enjoy various other state, local and federal taxes <b>exemptions.</b> Under certain <b>conditions,</b> these organizations are exempt from taxes on donations and membership fees. A feature that differentiates various non-profit organizations and profit-oriented companies is their source of income. Profit oriented companies depend on their income, obtained from sales of their goods or services to customers, who usually cover the price and cost of goods and services plus the profit. In contrast, nonprofit organizations are very dependent on membership fees, tax exemptions, members donations or depend on funds of the sponsoring agency which covers most of their costs, for example a federal government agency. Those non-profit organizations that have substantial operating costs beyond national borders and do not identify themselves as purely domestic in their mandate are International non-profit organizations. Most non-profit organizations remain in their national boundaries, on the territory of the country in which they were created, but a large number of non-profit organizations rapidly internationalize, and some larger non-profits have grown into important global actors.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis examines real estate IPOs {{and consists of}} a theoretical part and an empirical part focused on Polish market. The theoretical part offers an overview of theories concerning IPO and the three well-known phenomena related to initial public offerings, i. e. short term underpricing, long term overpricing and occurrence of IPO in waves. In case of short term underpricing and long term overpricing the theories presented are namely the theories based on information asymmetry, institutional theories, agency theories and behavioral theories. In case of IPO waves the theories presented are capital demand hypothesis, information asymmetry hypothesis and investor sentiment hypothesis. Some of the theories, namely the information asymmetry theory, are then applied to the specific case of real estate IPOs. The starting-point for the empirical part is an assumption that {{valuation of real estate}} IPOs is less complex than valuation of other companies and therefore information asymmetry among issuers and investors should be presented to a lesser extent. The valuation of real estate IPOs via their Net Asset Value ("NAV") requires less inputs and parameters compared to the corporate valuations with sophisticated financial modelling of the generators of value. Such lower complexity of valuation should be reflected in better ability of the investors to value the emission of the real estate company shares. Subsequently a lower underpricing of the IPOs should be reached and worse long term performance of the IPOs should be eliminated. In relation to the occurrence of the real estate IPOs the existence of IPO waves is assumed. In addition, subject to the assumption that the economical cycles on the real estate markets are longer than on the other markets, longer periods with higher occurrence of IPOs and longer periods with lower or no occurrence of IPOs are expected. The analysis investigates real estate IPOs which in USA means IPOs of so called REIT [...] "Real Estate Investment Trusts". REIT is a special institute that guarantees to the companies that adopt this statute, obviously upon meeting several <b>conditions,</b> <b>exemption</b> from the corporate income tax. The REIT are regularly dividend into so called equity REIT, investing in real properties, mortgage REIT, investing in mortgage loans and hybrid REIT, investing in both. With regard {{to the fact that the}} analogy of the REIT institute does not exist in Poland, the analysis investigates real estate companies of similar characteristics to the equity REIT. The analyzed markets are polish capital market and real estate market, which both could have been until very recently called emerging markets. It is assumed that the emerging market environment could have impacted the result of the analysis significantly. The analyzed period is basically identical with the modern period of functioning of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, meaning years 1992 [...] 2012. The size of the analyzed sample has reached limited but acceptable size of 22 titles. The subject of the analysis are all three major phenomena related to IPOs [...] IPO waves, initial underpricing and long term underperformance. The analysis confirmed occurence of a real estate IPO wave on the Polish market in the year 2007 as the market was featuring characteristics of a "hot" market and investors were overly optimistic about real estate titles. In addition, the analysis supported the assumption of a positive correlation between IPO occurence and GDP growth and also between IPO occurence and the volume of real estate investment on the market. Further, the hypothesis test confirmed existence of initial underpricing in case of the real estate IPOs, however to a smaller extent compared to the other corporate IPOs. Subsequent tests were looking to find correlation between the rate of initial underpricing and several factors of the emission such as size, segment of the real estate market etc. In case of long term underperformance, based on the gather evidence, the test could not reject the null hypothesis about the same of better performance of the real estate IPOs compared to the WIG stock indice. Long term underperfomance was thus not confirmed in case of real estate IPOs. Subsequent tests were again investigating impact of several characteristics of the offerings on their long term performance...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Banks play an {{increasingly}} {{important role in the}} economy because they {{are in a position to}}, inter alia, promote development of the environment by utilising their financial resources. In some instances lenders who took up finance from banks are responsible for damage to the environment. Why should banks that financed projects, in the normal course of events, be held liable for damage to the environment caused by borrowers? The question may be answered by a comparative legal study of the 2002 European Union Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Environmental Liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage; the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) of the United States; Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 (EPA) of the United Kingdom and section 28 of the National Environmental Management Act of 1998 (NEM A). NEMA, has its foundation in section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. It incorporates sustainable development as a tool to harmonise the necessity to develop with the need to protect the environment. At the same time NEMA emphasises the role of the principle of intergenerational equity, which presupposes the duty of the current generation to hand over the earth in a better condition than in which it was received from the previous generation. In the future banks, when finance is considered for projects that may harm the environment, must take environmental as well as economical factors into account. Purely economical reasons cannot be the only relevant factor. Development that is financially sound will have to be weighed up against social factors as well as the impact that it will have on the environment. Section 28 of NEMA places a general duty of care on every person who causes, has caused or may cause significant pollution or degradation of the environment to prevent such pollution or degradation from occurring, continuing or recurring. The persons saddled with the duty of care are the owner, the person in control, or the person who has the right to use land or premises. Banks may, under certain circumstances, be considered to be the owner, person in control, or even the person who has the right use land or premises. The polluter pays principle is introduced by section 28 as a basis for liability but the principle is expanded to include, not only the polluter, but also entities, such as banks, who in no way whatsoever, contributed to pollution or degradation. NEMA affords no protection to banks in cases where banks became owner of land by virtue of their security interest in the property. By following established commercial practices, banks may be held liable for environmental damage caused by their clients or erstwhile clients. The traditional role of banks as financial institutions has to change because of the duty placed on banks by the Constitution and NEMA to act as instruments in the protection of the environment. By exerting their influence and by implementing new procedures banks will be able to draw the attention of prospective clients to the need to comply with environmental legislation. In terms of the 2002 Directive of the European Union, the operator who directs an operation by which damage is caused can be held liable for environmental damage. It is necessary to prove that the bank exercised operational control over the business of the borrower. The 2002 Directive is more restrictive than section 28 of NEMA. CERCLA is the primary federal legislation dealing with pollution of hazardous substances. The Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to recover the costs for the reparation of damage to the environment. After the US v Fleet Factors Corporation decision the position was that banks might be held liable if their involvement with the management decisions of the borrower are such that they are in a position to influence the decisions of the borrower. The Asset Conservation Lender Liability and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 (ACA) changed the magnitude of the Fleet Factors decision. Provision is made by ACA to exempt lenders who held security in terms of a secured creditor <b>exemption,</b> on the <b>condition</b> that the property is alienated at the earliest practicable commercially reasonable time after acquiring it. The requirement for liability is that banks must exercise control over the day-to-day activities of a borrower. The Environmental Protection Act of 1990 in the United Kingdom states that the owner (other than the mortgagee in possession) is the person who has the right to receive the rent of the property if the property was let out. It includes the occupier of the property. The test is whether such a person is in control of the property. If the inference can be drawn that the lender is in control then it can be held liable for environmental damage. EPA, CERCLA as well as the Directive makes it clear that if sufficient control is exercised by a lender over the business of a borrower it may be held liable for damage to the environment. The emphasis should rather be placed on the ability of banks, generally, to influence borrowers than to hold them liable for damage caused to the environment by borrowers. Master...|$|R
