40|$|A {{large part}} of fishing {{behavior}} is choosing where to fish. Trawl skippers usually choose between known <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities,</b> which are observed as groups of trawls that are conducted in the same portion of a fishing ground, or go exploratory fishing. We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (<b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities)</b> using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard deviation 16, range 2 69) of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Within each <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method {{could also be used}} to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. <b>Fishing</b> <b>opportunities</b> could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries...|$|R
