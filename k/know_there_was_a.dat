25|$|No. 8 (Guards) Commando was {{a unit of}} the British Commandos {{and part}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The Commando was formed in June 1940 {{primarily}} from members of the Brigade of Guards. It was one of the units selected to be sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce. On arrival they became known as 'B' Battalion in an attempt at deception, not wanting the Axis forces to <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> commando formation in the theatre of war. The commando participated in the Battle of Crete and around Tobruk before being disbanded in late 1941. After this, many of its personnel went on to serve in other commando units formed in the area, including the Special Air Service.|$|E
25|$|While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a {{long and}} {{critical}} letter titled De Profundis, describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but {{which may or may}} not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> letter until it was referenced in a biography of Wilde's that Ross consulted on. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at Rouen, but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.|$|E

[...] "The Enemy Are the Future" [...] gets its name from a sentence in a promotional leaflet for the indie rock band The Enemy. Eastgate has explained that for [...] "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" [...] he randomly [...] "shouted lots of short phrases" [...] and then tried {{to make sense of what}} he said. The process led to stylised lines like [...] "Falling over aeroplanes and wanting to be a derelict".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Helene gradually {{turned to the}} north while rounding an anticyclone to its east. It rapidly intensified after its upgrade, and reached its peak intensity of [...] late on September 21. The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection. Increasing wind shear prevented Helene from attaining hurricane status, and the storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. By 0900UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast. This prompted NHC forecaster Lixion Avila to remark, [...] "If I {{did not have a}} reconnaissance plane in the area, I would not <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone by just observing IR satellite imagery." [...] The storm made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida at 1200UTC on September 22 after weakening from its peak intensity to winds of [...]|$|E
2500|$|My claim, so {{offensive}} to some, {{that the first}} task {{of the church is}} to make the world the world, not to make the world more just, is a correlative of this theological metaphysics.

That is an eschatological claim that presupposes we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beginning only because we have seen the end ... reation names God's continuing action, God's unrelenting desire for us to want to be loved by that love manifest in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics. Sounds praised the album on its release. Kevin Murphy wrote, [...] "Tinderbox romps and swoons {{with all the}} majesty of Dreamhouse", and added, [...] "it's a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette." [...] Jon Savage also hailed the record in Spin magazine: [...] "Its scope, ease, and assurance make it a good collection for the Banshees to relaunch themselves into the international market this spring. Carruthers fits in {{to the point that}} you wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> change, and Budgie's drumming is superb. Apart from the singles [...] "Cities in Dust" [...] and [...] "Candyman" [...] (which perpetuates the Banshees' sinister view of childhood), the sparks fly on the crystal clear [...] "Cannons" [...] and the unsettling [...] "Parties Fall".|$|E

2500|$|Sheridan then planned {{an attack}} where Custer would feint toward the Confederate right flank with Capehart's brigade, Warren's {{infantry}} corps would attack the left flank and Devin, joined by Pennington's brigade, {{would make a}} frontal attack on the Confederate entrenchments when they heard Warren's attack begin. Sheridan sent a staff officer to order up the V Corps and an engineer, Captain George L. Gillespie, to turn the front of Warren's Corps into Gravelly Run Church road obliquely to and {{a short distance from}} White Oak Road, about [...] east of Five Forks. In the Warren Court of Inquiry in 1880, Gillespie testified that contrary to Sheridan's after action report, he had made no reconnaissance of the Confederate line and did not <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "return" [...] on the left flank. He only knew he was to align the V Corps with the right flank of Devin's division and have them positioned as a turning column a short distance from White Oak Road and about [...] east of Five Forks.|$|E

We would obviously be very keen to find out where she was, and who she was with, between then and 4.20pm on Sunday. She was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white, long sleeved T-shirt and black Nike trainers... We will interview friends, her boyfriend and all her associates." [...] Ross Hemphill, who hadn't seen Nelson {{on the day of the}} murder, was interviewed by detectives and ruled out as a suspect. Police began checking CCTV and telephone records as well as interviewing friends and family and carrying out house-to-house enquiries. Witnesses reported seeing a fire on Monkey Hill at around 11.20pm on the night of the murder. D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fire at 11.20pm on Saturday in exactly the spot where Zoe was found. You would need local knowledge to go there. We firmly believe the answers in this case lie in this community... It had only got dark at 10pm and it was the hottest day of the year so there must have been people around this area." ...|$|E
