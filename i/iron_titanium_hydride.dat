40|$|The article {{presents}} {{data on the}} modification of <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead by creating titanium nanoshell on its surface by ion-plasma vacuum magnetron sputtering. To apply titanium nanoshell on the <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead vacuum coating plant of multifunctional nanocomposite coatings QVADRA 500 located {{in the center of}} high technology was used. Analysis of the micrographs of the original surface of <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead showed that the microstructure of the surface is flat, smooth, in addition the analysis of the microstructure of material surface showed the presence of small porosity, roughness, mainly cavities, as well as shallow longitudinal cracks. The presence of oxide film in <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> prevents the free release of hydrogen and fills some micro-cracks on the surface. Differential thermal analysis of both samples was conducted to determine the thermal stability of the initial <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead and bead with applied titanium nanoshell. Hydrogen thermal desorption spectra of the samples of the initial <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead and bead with applied titanium nanoshell show different thermal stability of compared materials in the temperature range from 550 to 860 о C.

Ti/polymer composites formed by infiltration of a polymer into porous Ti preforms are considered promising for such applications due to their tailorable elastic modulus, good corrosion resistance and potentially high mechanical performance. In this work, a fabrication process has been developed to produce porous Ti preforms from <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> powders. The sintering kinetics studies showed that titanium obtained from <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> had a lower sintering activation energy of 851 kJ/mol, as compared to 9313 kJ/mol for normal titanium powders. The lower sintering activation energy resulting from the fresh and clean (non-oxide covered) particle surfaces after dehydration has led to faster sintering (lower sintering temperature) for titanium powders derived from <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride.</b> The fabrication process using <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> offers a low production cost and low interstitial contaminants (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen).

40|$|Aluminum foam is a porous form {{of solid}} aluminum. One method of {{producing}} aluminum foam is the powder metallurgy process. Aluminum powder {{is mixed with}} a foaming agent, generally <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> (TiH 2), and pressed to form a compact. In the foaming process, the compact is heated and hydrogen gas is released from the agent to form bubbles within the surrounding aluminum. However, {{there is a significant}} gap between the onset of the decomposition temperature of the TiH 2 (400 °C) and the melting point of aluminum (660 °C). The hydrogen gas evolution begins while the aluminum is still solid, creating an accumulation of gas pressure which eventually causes microfissures inside the matrix. As a result, the final structure has interconnected pores and inferior properties. This problem may be overcome by delaying the temperature of hydrogen evolution so that it coincides with the melting point of aluminum.
