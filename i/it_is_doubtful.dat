5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> that he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of Banagher {{as a military}} position on the Shannon and on the highway from Leinster and Munster to Connacht was early appreciated by the English, whose forces seized it about {{the middle of the}} 16th century, coming up the river to do so. They constructed some fortifications which they called Fort Frankford (later Fort Falkland) and held the place {{in spite of the fact}} that the part of Offaly for some miles around Banagher was in the hands of the MacCoghlan clan. The MacCoghlans, aided by boundaries of bog and river, held their territories against all comers for about 500 years, even maintaining a footing by open defiance well into the 17th century. Garry Castle, Clonony Castle, and Moystown Castle are remains of MacCoghlan strongholds. Sometime after 1554, when Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain, Offaly County was named King's County in honour of Philip, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> if the royal jurisdiction extended to any of the MacCoghlan areas except Banagher. Ultimately, the MacCoghlans were overthrown and their lands were planted by order of James I issued in 1621.|$|E
5|$|For the {{eighteen}} months after its opening, the fort was manned by B {{company of the}} South Australian Volunteer Artillery but only on weekends. This changed in mid-1882 when South Australia's first permanent military force was formed. The fort became the headquarters for the South Australian Permanent Military Force, then the state's entire standing army of one officer and eighteen other ranks. Some of the unit was stationed at nearby Fort Largs from 1886; and, by 1889 the unit had grown to one officer and 45 other ranks. This force grew to 53 of all ranks by 1892 and was by then known as the Permanent Artillery. The unit trained 27 more non-commissioned officers and men who were sent to man the King George Sound batteries near Albany, Western Australia. Though some of the gunners served in the Second Boer War, the unit itself never saw action. Fort Glanville's section was called out in 1890, marching to assist the police with a waterside worker's strike in Port Adelaide. In this case no shots were fired and the strikers did not confront the police or troops. Additional defence acts were passed in 1886, 1890 and 1895 but, until defence passed into federal hands after 1901, the state's permanent military force was composed solely of artillery. Shortly after the federation of Australia, a regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery (RAA) was formed and {{what had been the}} Permanent Artillery became No.10 company RAA. The fort was manned to an extent during World War I, with one non-commissioned officer and 11 gunners stationed as of November 1914. Military reports and orders show the fort manned to at least mid-1918, though at this point <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>doubtful</b> if the guns were fit to engage targets.|$|E

Older historical research dates this conquest to 1153, although there are no definite sources for the date.
