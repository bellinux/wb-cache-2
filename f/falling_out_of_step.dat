50|$|HVDC links {{can be used}} {{to control}} {{problems}} in the grid with AC electricity flow. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the phase angle between source end voltage and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle will allow the systems {{at either end of the}} line to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step.</b> Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks at either end of the link, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.|$|R
40|$|Using chaos, {{consciousness}} and meme theories, developmental psychology and family systems theory, this paper explains the fractal {{structure of the}} human race and how, every human activity in each era, is influenced by a dominant set of attractors, E. C. +P. P. S. = P. E. (environmental conditions) +(psychophysiological state) =(physical events). Using these disciplines an analysis of the cultural evolution {{of the human race}} and a description of the driving forces of human history are presented. In addition these other insights result: 1. The understanding that the human race, as a whole, is a true dynamical system that follows the principles of chaos theory. And that under the seeming disorderly course of the past 40, 000 years of human history there exists an underlying order. 2. This order is the growth process described in developmental psychology, which when extrapolated to global systems is similar to the theory that Phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny, which in turn serves to explain certain aspects of the Bible. 3. That fractal segments express different aspects of the developmental growth of the whole species and that those who follow the underlying order, that applies to them, succeed, while those who <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with it suffer and generally fail...|$|R

She won in the 1983 primary as well. The 1987 vote was a different story. Despite the fact that Russell raised three times as much money as all of her five opponents combined in the primary race, she failed to gain a majority in the April vote, and she had to face Ruth Galanter, an urban planner with backing from environmental groups and people in the entertainment industry, in the final. Galanter was seen as someone who [...] "rode to prominence much as Russell did 18 years ago— as a darling of middle-class protestors angered by major development in their neighborhoods."

40|$|Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2012. When people {{sign up to}} play a game, {{they have}} broad {{expectations}} as to what {{will be involved in}} terms of time commitment, gameplay, skill requirements, genre and atmosphere. If the game does not meet their standards, they don’t play. This is as true of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOs) as it is of Monopoly. Otherwise, so long as what you’re asked to do sits within the boundaries of your expectations, you can happily immerse yourself. Sometimes, however, you may be asked during play to do something outside what you thought were the boundary lines. For example, if you were enjoying a cerebral role-playing game and suddenly discovered that in order to progress you had to undertake a fast-reactions, high-speed racing mini-game, your level of engagement might be compromised (Yes, I’m talking to you, Knights of the Old Republic). When this kind of thing happens, you are tugged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game back into reality; you then have to make the decision as to whether to carry on playing or not. This chapter considers one particular kind of expectation held by players of MMOs - the morality imbued in the game world’s fiction - and examines problems that can arise when the views of players and the game’s designer <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step.</b> It concludes with an assessment of what this means for the morality of game design itself...|$|R
40|$|Until 2009. {{the holding}} and {{transfer}} of securities held through {{banks and other}} custodians were governed by traditional legal principles applying to movable,tangible property. But operational and commercial trends in the securities and custody business, such as the intermediation and dematerialization of securities, had been challenging these legal foundations for quite some time. Swiss law had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with fundamental changes in technologies and market practices and no longer provided a transparent and predictable framework. In line with extensive discussions in international forums, a consensus emerged in Switzerland that legal certainty must be improved without reducing the flexibility of market practices. On I January 2010, the Federal Intermediated Securities Act of 2008 entered into force simultaneously with the Hague Securities Convention of 2006. This commentary provides concise and comprehensive answers to issues arising {{in connection with the}} application of the FISA and the HSC. The analysis of the new statutes focuses on relevant practical issues {{while at the same time}} providing sound theoretical foundations for the legal concepts used by the Convention and the Act. The authors have paid particular attention to the application of the FISA and the HSC in the international cross-border context, since the holding of intermediated securities across national borders is of particular relevance for the Swiss context. Because the authorship comprises both practicing lawyers and academics, the commeutary addresses both theoretical and practical issues with equal authority...|$|R
40|$|The rise in {{production}} and distribution of Christian Hagiography in the Early Byzantine Empire points towards a unique moment in Christian History. The role of the saint was moved from the margins to a central and dynamic position within the church hierarchy and broader religious landscape. Meeting the pagan claims of power and prestige, hagiographers crafted a saint that was more retributive than the earlier martyrologies and histories. The ascetic took on a role that was more akin to God's agent than suffering stranger. The deserts of Syria, Palestine and Egypt become the territory of struggle against a world that had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with God's will, but was slowly being corrected. This research looks for reasons as to why this prominent form of literature became more deliberately retributive through its progression toward the sixth century. A major focus of the argument will be the influence that Origen had on Christian theological interpretation. Beginning with a section on Origen, this research will move on through the five most prominent hagiographical compilations in late antiquity. In the end, it will show {{that each of these}} hagiographers' relationship with Origen's teaching and subsequent communities yielded a particular flavor of hagiography on a spectrum of retributive justice. Finally, it will take into account the influence that the development of a structured system of law under Justinian had on the religious outlook of various later works...|$|R
50|$|Ruby and the Doctor {{return to}} the Elysium, where Ruby fetches a gold pendant from her cabin {{for use as a}} weapon. Brack then tries to confront her, but she flees, {{convinced}} that he’s in league with the Cybermen. The Doctor heads to the bridge, to convince Captain Trench of the danger he faces, but Trench doesn’t believe him until it’s too late. The iceberg which Brack had carved into the shape of Straker’s head {{turns out to be a}} Cyberman base, and the Cybermen dock the iceberg with the Elysium and board. Much to the Doctor’s and Ruby’s surprise, Brack and Straker attempt to drive the Cybermen off with the ice-carving laser, but the Cybermen are armed with nerve gas and soon the passengers are unable to resist them. Brack breaks his leg falling from the deck, and the Cybermen leave him where he lies. The Doctor and Ruby try to avoid the Cybermen, but Ruby is pursued into the hold, where she accidentally knocks over the “PANAMA” crates and discovers that they contain hundreds of mannequin arms. The Cyberman tries to follow her through the pistons of the ship’s engines, but <b>falls</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> and is crushed. Ruby is reunited with the Doctor in the ship’s ballroom, where the Wizard of Oz cabaret has been interrupted by the arrival of more than one Tin Man. There, they find Brack’s secret project behind the curtains, a stage prop for the cabaret, nothing to do with the Cybermen at all.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} discourses {{produced by the}} selected newspaper coverage of the Montréal Canadiens and Québec Nordiques, two professional hockey clubs based {{in the province of}} Québec, from 1979 to 1984. Sport has long provided a medium for national identification, and constitutes one the most effective institutions through which the nation is imagined. This is especially true of Canada, where ice hockey has been celebrated as the country’s national game and a window into the Canadian soul. However, sport is a malleable institution; in Québec, hockey has long served as a symbol, speaking to French Canadian national identity, imbued with its own significance independent of any pan-Canadian context. The Montréal Canadiens, founded in 1909, were the sporting institution most intimately associated with French Canadian identity. However, following two decades of unprecedented social, political, and economic changes in Québec, newspaper journalists in the early 1980 s questioned the Canadiens’ monopoly over Québécois affections. As a result, the newspaper coverage of the rivalry between the Canadiens and the newly-formed Nordiques was anchored in Québec’s neo-nationalist politics, and the teams became channels for debates about language, social change, the shape of Québec society, and the nature of Québec identity. Through a critical discourse analysis of the newspaper coverage of the Canadiens and Nordiques in both French and English newspapers, I determined that the Nordiques were celebrated as an institution that both reflected and advanced the neo-nationalist project, while the Canadiens were depicted as having <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with the pace of Québec’s social and political change. The neo-nationalist identity constructed through this newspaper coverage normalized the French language as the foundation of Québécois identity, but, contrary to the claims of neo-nationalists themselves, also constructed ethnicity and biology as central to the neo-nationalist sense of self. The identity represented through this hockey coverage excluded and even demonized Québec residents, such as Anglophones, who deviated from these norms. These discourses exposed the deep schisms that existed in Québec society in the early 1980 s...|$|R

[...] The three aspects of the 1933 Act that the Wilko Court had found to bar the waiver of the right to litigate were purly procedural and did not confer any substantive protections. Specifically, the provision that allowed claims to be filed in state court under the act without the possibility of removal to federal court amounted to a waiver of the procedural protections federal civil procedure might grant to a plaintiff. In other recent cases, the Court had found that neither the similar provisions of the 1934 Act nor the Sherman Act prevented claims under them from being resolved in arbitration. And the FAA allowed for an arbitration agreement to be voided just like any other contract.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{certainly}} sweet to be merry {{at the right}} moment; but the right moment hardly {{seems to me the}} ten days of the Roman Carnival. It was my rather cynical suspicion perhaps that they wouldn't keep to my imagination the brilliant promise of legend; but I have been justified by the event and have been decidedly less conscious of the festal influences of the season than of the inalienable gravity of the place. There {{was a time when the}} Carnival was a serious matter--that is a heartily joyous one; but, thanks to the seven-league boots the kingdom of Italy has lately donned for the march of progress in quite other directions, the fashion of public revelry has <b>fallen</b> woefully <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step.</b> The state <b>of</b> mind and manners under which the Carnival was kept in generous good faith I doubt if an American can exactly conceive: he can only say to himself that for a month in the year there must have been things--things considerably of humiliation--it was comfortable to forget. But now that Italy is made the Carnival is unmade; and we are not especially tempted to envy the attitude of a population who have lost their relish for play and not yet acquired to any striking extent an enthusiasm for work. The spectacle on the Corso has seemed to me, on the whole, an illustration of that great breach with the past of which Catholic Christendom felt the somewhat muffled shock in September, 1870. A traveller acquainted with the fully papal Rome, coming back any time during the past winter, must have immediately noticed that something momentous had happened-- something hostile to the elements of picture and colour and [...] "style." [...] My first warning was that ten minutes after my arrival I found myself face to face with a newspaper stand. The impossibility in the other days of having anything in the journalistic line but the Osservatore Romano and the Voce della Verità used to seem to me much connected with the extraordinary leisure of thought and stillness of mind to which the place admitted you. But now the slender piping of the Voice of Truth is stifled by the raucous note of eventide vendors of the Capitale, the Libertà and the Fanfulla; and Rome reading unexpurgated news is another Rome indeed. For every subscriber to the Libertà there may well be an antique masker and reveller less. As striking a sign of the new régime is the extraordinary increase of population. The Corso was always a well-filled street, but now it's a perpetual crush. I never cease to wonder where the new-comers are lodged, and how such spotless flowers of fashion as the gentlemen who stare at the carriages can bloom in the atmosphere of those camere mobiliate of which I have had glimpses. This, however, is their own question, and bravely enough they meet it. They proclaimed somehow, to the first freshness of my wonder, as I say, that by force of numbers Rome had been secularised. An Italian dandy is a figure visually to reckon with, but these goodly throngs of them scarce offered compensation for the absent monsignori, treading the streets in their purple stockings and followed by the solemn servants who returned on their behalf the bows of the meaner sort; for the mourning gear of the cardinals' coaches that formerly glittered with scarlet and swung with the weight of the footmen clinging behind; for the certainty that you'll not, by the best of traveller's luck, meet the Pope sitting deep in the shadow of his great chariot with uplifted fingers like some inaccessible idol in his shrine. You may meet the King indeed, who is as ugly, as imposingly ugly, as some idols, though not so inaccessible. The other day as I passed the Quirinal he drove up in a low carriage with a single attendant; and a group of men and women who had been waiting near the gate rushed at him with a number of folded papers. The carriage slackened pace and he pocketed their offerings with a business- like air--hat of a good-natured man accepting handbills at a street-corner. Here was a monarch at his palace gate receiving petitions from his subjects--being adjured to right their wrongs. The scene ought to have thrilled me, but somehow it had no more intensity than a woodcut in an illustrated newspaper. Homely I should call it at most; admirably so, certainly, for there were lately few sovereigns standing, I believe, with whom their people enjoyed these filial hand-to-hand relations. The King this year, however, has had as little to do with the Carnival as the Pope, and the innkeepers and Americans have marked it for their own.|$|R
