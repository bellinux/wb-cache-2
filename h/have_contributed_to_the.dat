5|$|Over time, the {{traditional}} structure {{has had to}} adapt to very influential changes, including divorce {{and the introduction of}} single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and same-sex marriage, and increased interest in adoption.

5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{refinery}} {{was large}} and old, featuring outdated construction methods, and these factors are believed to <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire's severity.

Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E
5|$|When Poland {{entered the}} Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin {{reminded}} General Kasprzycki of the Polish {{role in the}} dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.

5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historic Shoshones, {{but it is not}} well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{scientists}} and engineers <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots —though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000.

5|$|Marine {{conservation}} {{has recently}} garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700miles (1,126.5km) of coastline and 1,300mi2 (3,370km2) of coral reef communities. The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components {{but only two}} of these (11km2) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's waters are classified as either endangered or threatened. Earthwatch-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E

5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three {{kings of}} England and may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legal {{treatise}} attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his {{acceptance of gifts}} from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases.

5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may <b>have</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abandonment {{of these kinds}} of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may {{have played a role in}} these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
