5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud.

5|$|By 1947, when John Crichton-Stuart, {{the fifth}} marquess, {{inherited}} the castle, the Bute family had divested itself {{of most of}} <b>its</b> <b>land</b> in South Wales. John sold off the family's remaining property interests and in 1950 he gave Caerphilly Castle to the state. The lakes were re-flooded and {{the final stages of}} the restoration work were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 21st century the castle is managed by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw as a tourist attraction. In 2006, the castle saw 90,914 visitors. It is protected as a scheduled monument and as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{fought on}} the site of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei, {{supporting}} the Tokugawa regime. After Meiji restoration, the Nanbu clan had much of <b>its</b> <b>land</b> confiscated, and in 1871, the heads of its branches were relieved of office. In the Meiji period, the former daimyō became part of the kazoku peerage, with Nanbu Toshiyuki receiving the title of hakushaku (Count). The main Nanbu line survives to the present day; Toshiaki Nanbu served as the chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
5|$|Further {{drainage}} of {{the mere}} occurred around 1720 and <b>its</b> <b>land</b> was reclaimed for farming. The ground remained marshy and still occasionally flooded {{at the start}} of the 20th century. In 1911 the castle was placed into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works and Public Buildings, later passing into the control of the government heritage agency English Heritage. Archaeological surveys of the site were carried out in 1987, 1988, 1992 and 2001.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{was born}} in Jamestown, New York, one of three sons of the {{president}} of a banknote-engraving company. He attended the City University of New York, and practiced law for about 25 years. During the American Civil War, Shepard was a Union Army recruiter and subsequently earned the rank of colonel. He was later a founder and benefactor of several institutions and banks. When Shepard moved to the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of Scarborough-on-Hudson, he founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church and built Woodlea; the house and <b>its</b> <b>land</b> are now part of Sleepy Hollow Country Club.|$|E
5|$|The case {{is often}} {{referred}} to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating <b>its</b> <b>land</b> rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to re-assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re-acquired by the tribe in fee simple.|$|E
5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} <b>its</b> <b>land,</b> and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria's {{biodiversity}} is conserved {{in three}} national parks, 11 nature parks and 16 biosphere reserves. Nearly 35 per cent of <b>its</b> <b>land</b> area consists of forests, {{where some of}} the oldest trees in the world, such as Baikushev's pine and the Granit oak, grow. Most of the plant and animal life is central European, although representatives of Arctic and alpine species are present at high altitudes. Its flora encompass more than 3,800 species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger fungi of Bulgaria reported that more than 1,500 species occur in the country. Animal species include owls, rock partridges, wallcreepers and brown bears. The Eurasian lynx and the eastern imperial eagle have small, but growing populations.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (although Kansas and North Dakota have {{national}} grasslands). In addition, Puerto Rico contains El Yunque National Forest. Alaska has {{the most}} national forest land with 21.9 million acres (8.9 million ha), followed by California (20.8 million acres, 8.4 million ha) and Idaho (20.4 million acres, 8.3 million ha). Idaho also has the greatest percent of <b>its</b> <b>land</b> in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%. On maps, national forests in the west generally show the true extent of their area, but those in the east often only show purchase districts, within which usually {{only a minority of}} the land is owned by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|During Bhimsen's prime ministership, the Gurkha empire {{had reached}} its {{greatest}} expanse from Sutlej {{river in the}} west to the Teesta river in the east. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the East India Company lasting from 1814–16, which was concluded with the Treaty of Sugauli, by which Nepal lost almost one-third of <b>its</b> <b>land.</b> It also led to the establishment of a permanent British Residency. The death of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah in 1816 before his maturity, and the immature age of his heir, King Rajendra Bikram Shah, coupled with the support from Queen Tripurasundari (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to continue to remain in power even after Nepal's defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese War.|$|E

5|$|Financial {{mismanagement}} {{and internal}} disputes led to {{delays in the}} project. By the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in late 1854, {{a number of other}} cemeteries had opened nearer to London or {{were in the process of}} opening. While some parishes in London did arrange for the LNC to handle the burials of their dead, many preferred to use nearer cemeteries. The LNC had anticipated handling between 10,000 and 50,000 burials per year, but the number never rose above 4,100 per year, and in its first 150 years of operations only 231,730 burials had been conducted. Buying the land for Brookwood Cemetery and building the cemetery and railway had been very expensive, and by the time the cemetery opened the LNC was already on the verge of bankruptcy. The LNC remained solvent by selling surplus parts of <b>its</b> <b>land,</b> but as the land had been chosen in the first place for its remoteness, sales were low.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} <b>its</b> <b>land</b> area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu {{was the target of}} heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates these events each year on July 9, with the ringing of the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in these events.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L.

Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase <b>its</b> <b>land</b> along with the 620 N.
