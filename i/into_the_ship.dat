5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, a degaussing coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines. Her first wartime operation saw her participating in laying a minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September. She conducted the operation with the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her first set of mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While moored in the harbor, she was attacked by British bombers on 4 September; German anti-aircraft gunners shot down {{four of the five}} Blenheim bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Twenty-nine men were killed or wounded in the crash.|$|E

Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E

Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow, North Dakota. There, the agents are captured by the Smoking Man's men and are escorted away. Deep inside, Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil, which seeps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Skinner recovers and returns to work. Mulder sees Scully at Melissa's grave, explaining that Cardinal {{was found dead in}} his cell. Meanwhile, Krycek is trapped within the silo, banging on the door in an attempt to be let out.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E

The first attack failed, but the second dealt Italia (ex-Littorio) and Roma much damage. The hit on Roma caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the after engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and arc-induced fires in {{the stern of the}} ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb slammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> which detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and the explosion of the #2 main turret's magazines, throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and listing to starboard, Roma capsized and broke in two, carrying 1,393 menincluding Bergaminidown with her.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers {{a message}} from her mother after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving her closure. Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley {{that he plans to}} {{overload}} the Anesidoras fusion reactor and destroy the station, thus ensuring that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the water out of the hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E
5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} of some kind. In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches to his face through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Senel and {{his team}} are joined by a {{treasure}} hunter named Norma as well as Moses, who has decided to atone for his earlier actions. Together, the team travels deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> where they discover that not only does Vaclav have Shirley, but her older sister Stella, who Shirley and Senel believed dead three years earlier when the Empire's forces invaded their hometown. After being forced to escape when they are confronted by Vaclav's underlings, the Terrors, the party regroups and meets an amnesiac women named Grune and boy named Jay who joins the team and accompanies them to the Legacy's bridge. They confront Vaclav once more, who plans to use Shirley and Stella's latent Merines powers to activate a giant laser cannon located on the ship to destroy the Ferines' village and later subjugate other countries around the world. Although the party is victorious, Vaclav sets the cannon to fire in his final moments, with Stella in turn awakening her powers {{just in time to}} fly into the path of the beam, sacrificing herself.|$|E
