Communications-based approaches to reducing highway accidents include vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications.

30|$|Web-based applications, however, are {{essential}} for the remote live monitoring if the monitoring {{is expected to be}} done through any web-enabled devices. The major limitation for desktop applications built for real-time monitoring is that the applications have to be installed on a computer before using them. The <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> violates the concept of remote real-time monitoring, and restricts the availability and flexibility of remote monitoring through web-enabled devices. For example, remote monitoring may not be done through a hotel computer if the applications for monitoring cannot be installed. In contrast, web-based applications are installed on a remote server and accessible through a web browser. Because a web browser is a standard application for almost all web-enabled devices, it offers an ideal solution for the application accessibility problem. In addition, if data analysis is computational intensive, desktop applications may not be run efficiently if they are installed on a local device. In contrast, the efficiency of web-based applications is not affected by computational capacity of the local device as they are installed and run on cloud virtual machines. Although cloud virtual machines provide on-demand computing resources, the speed and efficiency of web applications may be further improved using emerging lightweight solutions, such as docker and kubernetes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Unified power Flow Controller (UPFC) is {{effective}} equipment in controlling the power {{flow in the}} new deregulated electricity markets. The UPFC realizes its function by changing part {{or all of the}} parameters affecting flowing of the power in a transmission line. These parameters include the bus voltages, the line impedance and the power angle. The UPFC {{is by far the most}} advanced and versatile device in the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device family. However, several problems, reliability, cost, and footprint requirement, hinder its widespread acceptance by the electric utilities. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional UPFC, this work proposed and studied a new UPFC technology that addresses these impediments. This novel technology is called the Distributed PFC (DPFC). The proposed DPFC is based on single-phase system, considering the high voltage insulation, the manufacturing cost, and the <b>installation</b> <b>requirement.</b> A hierarchy control of the DPFC system is proposed, which includes local unit control and a central control unit. The central control unit calculates series voltage and shunt real/reactive power commands for every DPFC unit. The local DPFC unit accepts commands from the central control unit, monitors local voltage at the connection point, and realizes its control commands. The functions and performance of the DPFC system is verified with simulation and experiments...|$|E

Marine structures foundation selection and design are complicated because of the unique loading configurations, <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> and greater uncertainties in site investigation and selection of appropriate soil parameters. Published criteria for selection, design {{and analysis of}} marine structure foundations are very limited and currently unavailable. Whilst, obtaining a technical piling database for marine structure foundation design and construction requires time and experience. The objective of this study includes identifying the driving factors that contributed to the piles performances behaviour of marine structures and to analyse various piling properties in marine condition. The Phase 2 Development of the Deepwater Petroleum Terminal in Pengerang, Johor, was used as a case study. From the literature researches and available site investigations, the piles performances behaviour was determined and the analysis was tabulated in graphical forms. The findings of this study found that the piles performances behaviour of marine structure are correlated to each other such as pile bearing capacity, pile diameter, pile length, pile embedded depth and also pile loading. However, further studies and geotechnical modelling are needed to best justify the correlations in detail, in order to correctly determine the pile performances behaviour of marine structure...|$|E

With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and Cell Global Identity (CGI). Because of high power consumption and extra resource <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> in GPS related methods, Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and readily available solution for location information. CGI location information is four set head i. e.

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable seat belt anchorage conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Power systems {{over the}} recent past few years, has {{undergone}} dramatic revolution in terms of government and private investment in various areas such as renewable generation, incorporation of smart grid to better control and operate the power grid, large scale energy storage, and fast responding reactive power sources. The ongoing growth of the electric power industry is {{mainly because of the}} deregulation of the industry and regulatory compliance which each participant of the electric power system has to comply with during planning and operational phase. Post worldwide blackouts, especially the year 2003 blackout in north-east USA, which impacted roughly 50 million people, more attention has been given to reactive power planning. At present, there is steady load growth but not enough transmission capacity to carry power to load centers. There is less transmission expansion due to high investment cost, difficulty in getting environmental clearance, and less lucrative cost recovery structure. Moreover, conventional generators close to load centers are aging or closing operation as they cannot comply with the new environmental protection agency (EPA) policies such as Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and MACT. The conventional generators are getting replaced with far away renewable sources of energy. Thus, the traditional source of dynamic reactive power support close to load centers is getting retired. This has resulted in more frequently overloading of transmission network than before. These issues lead to poor power quality and power system instability. The problem gets even worse during contingencies and especially at high load levels. There is a clear need of power system static and dynamic monitoring. This can help planners and operators to clearly identify severe contingencies causing voltage acceptability problem and system instability. Also, it becomes imperative to find which buses and how much are they impacted by a severe contingency. Thus, sufficient static and dynamic reactive power resource is needed to ensure reliable operation of power system, during stressed conditions and contingencies. In this dissertation, a generic framework has been developed for filtering and ranking of severe contingency. Additionally, vulnerable buses are identified and ranked. The next task after filtering out severe contingencies is to ensure static and dynamic security of the system against them. To ensure system robustness against severe contingencies optimal location and amount of VAR support required needs to be found. Thus, optimal VAR allocation needs to be found which can ensure acceptable voltage performance against all severe contingency. The consideration of contingency in the optimization process leads to security constrained VAR allocation problem. The problem of static VAR allocation requirement is formulated as minlp. To determine optimal dynamic VAR <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> the problem is solved in dynamic framework and is formulated as a Mixed Integer Dynamic Optimization (MIDO). Solving the VAR allocation problem for a set of severe contingencies is a very complex problem. Thus an approach is developed in this work which reduces the overall complexity of the problem while ensuring an acceptable optimal solution. The VAR allocation optimization problem has two subparts i. e. interger part and nonlinear part. The integer {{part of the problem is}} solved by branch and bound (B 2 ̆ 6 B) method. To enhance the efficiency of B 2 ̆ 6 B, system based knowledge is used to customize the B 2 ̆ 6 B search process. Further to reduce the complexity of B 2 ̆ 6 B method, only selected candidate locations are used instead of all plausible locations in the network. The candidate locations are selected based upon the effectiveness of the location in improving the system voltage. The selected candidate locations are used during the optimization process. The optimization process is divided into two parts: static optimization and dynamic optimization. Separating the overall optimization process into two sub-parts is much more realistic and corresponds to industry practice. Immediately after the occurrence of the contingency, the system goes into transient (or dynamic) phase, which can extend from few milliseconds to a minute. During the transient phase fast acting controllers are used to restore the system. Once the transients die out, the system attains steady state which can extend for hours with the help of slow static controllers. Static optimization is used to ensure acceptable system voltage and system security during steady state. The optimal reactive power allocation as determined via static optimization is a valuable information. It 2 ̆ 7 s valuable as during the steady state phase of the system which is a much longer phase (extending in hours), the amount of constant reactive power support needed to maintain steady system voltage is determined. The optimal locations determined during the static optimization are given preference in the dynamic optimization phase. In dynamic optimization optimal location and amount of dynamic reactive power support is determined which can ensure acceptable transient performance and security of the system. To capture the true dynamic behavior of the system, dynamic model of system components such as generator, exciter, load and reactive power source is used. The approach developed in this work can optimally allocate dynamic VAR sources. The results of this work show the effectiveness of the developed reactive power planning tool. The proposed methodology optimally allocates static and dynamic VAR sources that ensure post-contingency acceptable power quality and security of the system. The problem becomes manageable as the developed approach reduces the overall complexity of the optimization problem. We envision that the developed method will provide system planners a useful tool for optimal planning of static and dynamic reactive power support that can ensure system acceptable voltage performance and security...|$|E
