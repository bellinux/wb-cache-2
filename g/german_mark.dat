5|$|During {{the initial}} post-war period, a {{shortage}} of machinery, tools, and materials, {{as well as a}} dearth of new orders, hampered operations. Some salvage work occurred, as well as rubble-clearance and basic repairs. One of the first, rare, major contracts was for a university hospital in Bonn, 1946-49. The introduction of the <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> in 1948 {{and the beginning of the}} Wirtschaftswunder brought more new work.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 21/22 October 1944, Private Ernest Alvia ("Smokey") Smith used a PIAT to destroy a <b>German</b> <b>Mark</b> V Panther tank, one of three Panthers and two {{self-propelled}} guns attacking his small group. The self-propelled vehicles were also knocked out. He then used a Thompson submachine gun to kill or repel about 30 enemy soldiers. His actions secured a bridgehead on the Savio River in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Following German reunification, the US {{government}} {{announced plans to}} fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished {{at a cost of}} 50 Million <b>German</b> <b>Mark</b> (about US $26M or 25M €), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz-Bauer-Institute.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{maintain}} a uniform Berlin employment market, on March 20, 1949, in addition the elimination of the payment ceiling, Western powers, together with the abolition of the capping limit, created a Wage Compensation Fund for employees of the industrial/business economy. This would mean that the East cross-border commuters could exchange 60% of their wages, which were paid in East <b>German</b> <b>Marks,</b> to (West) <b>German</b> <b>Marks</b> at the rate of 1:1 once back in West Berlin, while the West cross-border commuters were only paid 10% of their income in <b>German</b> <b>Marks,</b> and 90% of their income in East <b>German</b> <b>Marks.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Deutsche Mark {{played an}} {{important}} role in the reunification of Germany. It was introduced as the official currency of East Germany in July 1990, replacing the East <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> (Mark der DDR), in preparation for unification on 3 October 1990. East German marks were exchanged for German marks at a rate of 1:1 for the first 4000 marks and 2:1 for larger amounts. Before reunification, each citizen of East Germany coming to West Germany was given Begrüßungsgeld (welcome money), a per capita allowance of DM 100 in cash. The government of Germany and the Bundesbank were in major disagreement over the exchange rate between the East <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> and the <b>German</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1998, the Council of the European Union {{fixed the}} {{irrevocable}} exchange rate, effective 1 January 1999, for <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> to euros as DM 1.95583 = €1.|$|E

25|$|The East <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> {{was officially}} valued by the East German {{government}} at parity with the (West German) Deutsche Mark. However, {{because it was}} not readily convertible and the GDR's export profile was restricted, it was practically worthless outside East Germany. The few East Germans able to visit the West often found themselves having to rely on their West German relatives as a result.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago Produce Exchange was {{established}} in 1874, renamed the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898 and then reorganised into the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1919. Following {{the end of the}} postwar international gold standard, in 1972 the CME formed a division called the International Monetary Market (IMM) to offer futures contracts in foreign currencies: British pound, Canadian dollar, <b>German</b> <b>mark,</b> Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc.|$|E
25|$|The modern kuna was {{introduced}} on May 30, 1994, starting a transitional period from the Croatian dinar, ending on December 31, 1994. The exchange rate between dinar and kuna was 1 kuna = 1000 dinars. Since then, Croatia {{has been in}} a system of de facto currency board with a fixed exchanged rate. The kuna was pegged to the <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> from the start. With the replacement of the mark by the euro, the kuna's peg effectively switched to the euro.|$|E

Nürnberg won the Bundesliga in that season, even though his contribution consisted of only 13 games, none of them league matches. He then transferred to Wiener Sportclub in Vienna for 45,000 <b>German</b> <b>marks,</b> where he managed to impress. After the season, he switched to TSV 1860 München for 100,000 <b>German</b> <b>marks.</b> In that season, he had 31 appearances and even scored one goal, but his team was relegated, {{he moved on to}} Ajax Amsterdam in the Netherlands.|$|R

25|$|In June 1992, Estonia {{replaced}} the ruble {{with its own}} freely convertible currency, the kroon (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the <b>German</b> <b>Mark</b> {{at the rate of}} 8 Estonian kroons for 1 Deutsche Mark. When Germany introduced the euro the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro. Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008 but due to high inflation rates the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Estonia {{decided that}} the country should adopt the euro as its {{official}} currency, and finalized the design of Estonian euro coins in late 2004. The switchover to the euro took place on 1 January 2011, later than planned, because continued high inflation had prevented the country from fulfilling the entry criteria earlier. Until joining the eurozone, the Estonian kroon had been pegged to the euro {{at a rate of}} 15.64664 EEK to one euro; before then, the kroon was pegged to the <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> at approximately 8 EEK to one DEM.|$|E
25|$|In July, {{circulation}} of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the litas {{became the only}} legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the litas, there {{was an effort to}} weed out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the <b>German</b> <b>mark,</b> but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very “dollarized” as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 {{the brother}} of PDK leader Hashim Thaçi Gani Thaçi was found during a raid in Prishtina with a million <b>German</b> <b>marks</b> (500,000 euros) in cash. The origin of the money was uncertain.|$|R

25|$|Following the German occupation, on 10 May 1940, the guilder was pegged to the Reichsmark {{at a rate}} of 1 guilder = 1.5 Reichsmark. This {{rate was}} reduced to 1.327 on 17 July of the same year. The {{liberating}} Allied forces set an exchange rate of 2.652 guilders = 1 U.S. dollar, which became the peg for the guilder within the Bretton Woods system. In 1949, the peg was changed to 3.8 guilders = 1 dollar, approximately matching the devaluation of the British pound. In 1961, the guilder was revalued to 3.62 guilders = 1 dollar, a change approximately in line with that of the <b>German</b> <b>mark.</b> After 1967 guilders were made from nickel instead of silver.|$|E
25|$|Kosovo and Montenegro have {{unilaterally}} {{adopted and}} used the euro since its launch, as they previously used the <b>German</b> <b>mark</b> rather than the Yugoslav dinar. This was due to political concerns that Serbia would use the currency to destabilise these provinces (Montenegro was then in a union with Serbia) so they received Western help in adopting and using the mark (though there was no restriction {{on the use of}} the dinar or any other currency). They switched to the euro when the mark was replaced, but have signed no monetary agreement with the ECB; rather the country depends only on euros already in circulation. Kosovo also still uses the Serbian dinar, which replaced the Yugoslav dinar, in areas mainly populated by the Serbian minority.|$|E
25|$|Finland {{joined the}} Bretton Woods Agreement in 1948. The value of markka was pegged {{to the dollar}} at 320 mk/US$, which became 3.20 new mk/US$ in 1963 and devalued to 4.20 mk/US$ in 1967. After the {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971, a basket of currencies became the new reference. Inflation was high (over 5%) during 1971–85. Occasionally, devaluation was used, 60% in total between 1975 and 1990, allowing the currency to more closely follow the depreciating US dollar than the rising <b>German</b> <b>mark.</b> The paper industry, which mainly traded in US dollars, was often blamed for demanding these devaluations to boost their exports. Various economic controls were removed and the market was gradually liberalized throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In early {{childhood}} Heckert displayed an unusual artistic talent for painting, and he determined {{to become a}} painter. His parents judged his passion as “breadless art” and forced him to complete an apprenticeship as a wholesale and foreign trade merchandiser {{in order to support}} financially his parental household (out of 96,- <b>German</b> <b>Marks</b> net wage during the first year as an apprentice he had to deliver at home 80,- <b>German</b> <b>Marks</b> [...] ). After 11 years of little success in this occupation he managed - in spite of only having studied up to the compulsory school level - to study arts in the SHFBK Braunschweig and graduated with outstanding achievements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{boulevard}} soon {{developed into}} a shoppers' paradise in the GDR. It also served the ideological function of introducing visitors {{to the culture of}} its [...] "socialist sister states".Shopping was a mixed experience for visitors from the West. Most stores, such as the GUM department store would not accept payment for purchased items without a receipt from an East German bank showing that the West <b>German</b> <b>Marks</b> had been exchanged for East <b>German</b> <b>Marks</b> at a rate of 1:1. In the West, the exchange rate was 1:8 but most restaurants and bookstores were not concerned with these requirements so bargains were to be found.|$|R
