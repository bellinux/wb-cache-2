2500|$|Hemispherical photography, {{also known}} as fisheye or canopy photography, is a {{technique}} to estimate solar radiation and characterize plant canopy geometry using photographs taken looking upward through an <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> (Rich 1990). [...] Typically, the viewing angle approaches or equals 180-degrees, such that all sky directions are simultaneously visible. [...] The resulting photographs record the geometry of visible sky, or conversely the geometry of sky obstruction by plant canopies or other near-ground features. [...] This geometry can be measured precisely and used to calculate solar radiation transmitted through (or intercepted by) plant canopies, {{as well as to}} estimate aspects of canopy structure such as leaf area index. [...] Detailed treatments of field and analytical methodology have been provided by Paul Rich (1989, 1990) and Robert Pearcy (1989).|$|E

50|$|The need to {{accommodate}} the shutter mechanism within the lens barrel limited the design of <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses</b> {{and it was not}} until the widespread use of focal-plane shutters that <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses</b> were developed.|$|R
50|$|The mood {{effect of}} {{perspective}} distortion achieved by rectilinear <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is that the}} resulting image looks grotesque and unsettling, while not looking as unrealistic as curvilinear fisheye lenses which display barrel distortion. The effect is especially noticeable the closer the camera is to the subject, as its amount increases the shorter the focal length {{is at the same}} field size.|$|R
5000|$|In the circle, a {{group of}} characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though {{occasionally}} elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character {{as he or she}} speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> added to the [...] "drug-induced" [...] feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word [...] "marijuana" [...] while in the circle (except in one episode [...] "Reefer Madness"), often referring to it as [...] "stuff" [...] or a [...] "stash". In the episode [...] "Bye-Bye Basement", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to [...] "weed"; in [...] "The Relapse", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for [...] "smoking weed and beating up freshmen;" [...] in [...] "Ski Trip" [...] Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in [...] "Eric's Burger Job", Kelso blames his [...] "roach clip" [...] when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes ("That Wrestling Show" [...] and [...] "Hyde Moves In") Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words [...] "Cannabis Sativa" [...] written on a Campbell's soup can; and in [...] "The Pill" [...] Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, [...] "That kid's on dope!" [...] A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.|$|E
40|$|Documentation of {{cultural}} heritage sites can provide data and records for continuing research, analysis, monitoring, and change detection. Digital documentation allows computational analysis {{as well as}} archival recording of objects and sites. It provides a nondestructive approach to artifact or site mapping and measurement. Virtual models {{of cultural}} sites can be created from digital imagery, using widely available non-metric digital cameras and video recorders. Software, such as PhotoModeler ® allows the construction of three-dimensional virtual modeling of objects, sites, and rooms by using multiple digital photographs. Methods for constructing virtual models currently require multiple photos from varying angles to provide sufficient ground control points as well as ample coverage of the site. Use of an <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> camera, such as the Nikon fish eye lens, can overcome the need for numerous pictures and allows the capture of more information per image. This can speed the process of documentation while also providing more coverage. Wide-angle lenses have not been previously used due to the difficulty in registering the extreme distortion {{on the edges of}} the lenses. A project was undertaken to calibrate such a lens and to test its effectiveness in capturing images for virtual reconstruction using PhotoModeler software. The lens used was a Nikon fish-eye lens, mounted on a Nikon Coolpix camera. Two sites were selected for the test. The first was the interior of a modern building with a large three-story atrium. This site was chosen to initially calibrate the camera and lens for the software. The second site selected was the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, a complex of archaeological sites used to test the effectiveness of the camera, lens, and PhotoModele...|$|E
40|$|Most {{wide-angle}} lenses are not {{wide enough}} to show an entire room with material possessions in context. However, such wide coverage can be accomplished with a fish-eye lens. Recently, fish-eye auxiliary lenses have become available at low cost, making them affordable for most ethnographers. The author demonstrates the use-fulness of a fish-eye lens with a photograph of his living room in Albuquerque. The limitations of standard lenses are shown with Vicos (Peru) photographs by John Col-lier, Jr. Fish-eye lenses {{can also be used}} to document the personnel present at meetings. I first thought of using a fish-eye lens during my first summer of fieldwork as a beginning anthropology graduate student. I had just completed my first year and was undecided about whether I wanted to be an archaeologist or a cul-tural anthropologist. I had to get archaeology into or out of my system. I was lucky and got a job as project photographer at Mesa Verde National Park with the Wetherill Mesa Project. I had to photograph many kivas, rooms, and other architectural features of Anasazi ruins. It frustrated me that none of my wide-angle lenses could take in enough to show what I thought was sufficient context. For example, even the widest lens did not show how all the features of a room related to each other. In addition, as the season progressed it was often difficult to visually correlate images that covered only partial views at differ-ent levels of excavation. In 1959, it was impossible to do this with one global photograph, and, if it was attempted at all, an integrated picture had to be pieced together with scissors and paste, from partial views. That was when I first thought of using a fish-eye lens. There are many other applications of fish-eye lenses in anthropology (and I am sure our readers can think of many more). For example, an <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> can be used to document who was present at a meet-I am grateful to Malcolm Collier for providing scans of several Vicos photographs and brief cap...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of special purpose lenses, the most popular being fisheye <b>lenses,</b> which are <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses</b> with an angle of view of up to 180 degrees or more, with very noticeable (sometimes intended) distortion.

50|$|The first Biogon (2.8 / 3.5 cm, unbalanced) {{was created}} in 1935 by Ludwig Bertele, then {{referenced}} by designer Zeiss Ikon Dresden, the Contax created as a modification of the then Sonnar. It was developed by Carl Zeiss in approximately 1937 and manufactured in Jena, then a redesign in Oberkochen. In 1954, a new Biogon with a 90° angle (Super Wide Angle) was also designed by Ludwig Bertele for Carl Zeiss, which opened the way to <b>extreme</b> <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses.</b> They were produced from 1954 as the 4.5 / 21 mm for Contax, in 1954. 4,5/38 mm for Hasselblad Super Wide, and from 1955 to 1956 as the 4.5 / 53 mm and 4.5 / 75 mm for the Linhof.|$|R
5000|$|Kubrick was {{a perfectionist}} of meticulous research, with {{thousands}} of photographs taken of potential locations, {{as well as many}} scene takes; however, per Malcolm McDowell, he usually [...] "got it right" [...] early on, so there were few takes. So meticulous was Kubrick that McDowell stated [...] "If Kubrick hadn't been a film director he'd have been a General Chief of Staff of the US Forces. No matter what it is—even if it's a question of buying a shampoo it goes through him. He just likes total control."

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} perspective distortion of <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lenses</b> in laparoscopes on hand-eye coordination during endoscopic manipulation. Methods: Sixteen subjects repeatedly performed a standardized positioning task in a pelvi-trainer under two conditions. The subjects had no prior experience with endoscopic manipulation. In one condition, a <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> with considerable perspective distortion was used; in the other, a telephoto lens without perspective distortion was used. Task time and number of errors were measured. Results: Task time {{and the number of}} errors did not significantly increase in the condition with a <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens.</b> Conclusions: The perspective effect did not influence task performance in endoscopic manipulation in this experiment. Subjects indicated that they even preferred the <b>wide-angle</b> <b>lens</b> because its <b>extreme</b> perspective improved their perception of depth.
