5|$|In 1914, Zeller {{published}} {{a study of}} the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae {{at the top of the}} stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from the center.|$|E

[...] Green writes that Villani's Cronica {{was one of}} three types of chronicles found in the 14th century, the type which was largely a universal history. Other types would be chronicles of particular historic episodes such as Dino Compagni's account of the White Guelphs and Black Guelphs or the more domestic chronicle that focused on the fortunes and events of one family, as written by Donato Velluti or Giovanni Morelli.|$|E

Although this type of architecture allows unstructured parallelism in a dynamically non-contiguous memory system, it also produces challenges in the efficient mapping of parallel algorithms to a many-core system.|$|E

2500|$|... "On closer {{analysis}} the oracle contains {{essential information}} which Oedipus seems to neglect." [...] The {{wording of the}} Oracle: I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me refers to Oedipus' real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children {{is defined as the}} biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: you are not your father's son defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the [...] "two set of parents" [...] alternative. Thus the question of two set of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus's reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.|$|E
2500|$|The Beaver Deceiver (a {{trapezoidal}} shaped culvert fence) {{was invented}} by Skip Lisle in the 1990s while working for the Penobscot Indian Nation in Maine. [...] It is very effective at completely eliminating beaver damming of a culvert. It works in three ways. First, {{the perimeter of the}} trapezoidal fence is typically 40 – 50 feet long, making it difficult for a beaver to dam the entire fence. Second, as beavers try to dam the culvert, the fence forces them to dam <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from the culvert, which is not in their nature. Third, as they dam farther out on the fence, the opening of the stream into which it flows gets wider. Therefore, the damming stimuli of the sound and feel of moving water decrease the farther they dam on the fence. If the sides of the fence are at least 12 feet long, the beavers will generally leave the fence alone.|$|E

The four-lane street continues south to provide access to the neighborhood of Lanište, the Remetinečki Gaj Street, and Arena Zagreb.

2500|$|In March 2006, John Mearsheimer, {{professor}} of political science at the University of Chicago, and Stephen Walt, {{professor of}} international affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, co-wrote a paper entitled [...] "The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy," [...] published in The London Review of Books. Mearsheimer and Walt criticized what they described as [...] "the Israel lobby" [...] for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from U.S. interests and toward Israel's interests. They referred to Dershowitz specifically as an [...] "apologist" [...] for the Israel lobby. In an interview in March 2006 for The Harvard Crimson, Dershowitz called the article [...] "one-sided" [...] and its authors [...] "liars" [...] and [...] "bigots." [...] The following day on MSNBC's Scarborough Country, he suggested the paper had been taken from various hate sites: [...] "every paragraph virtually is copied from a neo-Nazi Web site, from a radical Islamic Web site, from David Duke’s Web site." [...] Dershowitz subsequently wrote a report challenging the paper, arguing that it contained [...] "three types of major errors: quotations are wrenched out of context, important facts are misstated or omitted, and embarrassingly weak logic is employed." [...] In a letter in the London Review of Books in May 2006, Mearsheimer and Walt denied that they had used any racist sources for their article, writing that Dershowitz had failed to offer any evidence to support his claim.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} in the {{discussion}} she trotted off to turn a corner which was avoided by the footpath, the road and the path reuniting at a point a little further on.

60|$|The doctor then departed, {{and they}} waited till the evening.

Just as this was done, some great rents occurred, and suddenly a mass of ice larger than the brig fell from the top of a cliff into the sea. No danger flowed from this, but the mass thus thrown off was so large as to destroy the balance of the berg, and, to the horror of the sailors, the huge mountain began to roll over. Fortunately it fell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from the brig. Had it rolled toward her, no human power could have saved our voyagers.

Various {{feelings}} wrought in him the determination after all to go to the Grange to-day as if nothing new had happened. He could not help rejoicing that he had never made the offer and been rejected; mere friendly politeness required that he should call to see Dorothea about the cottages, and now happily Mrs. Cadwallader had prepared him to offer his congratulations, if necessary, without showing too much awkwardness. He really did not like it: giving up Dorothea was very painful to him; but there was something in the resolve to make this visit forthwith and conquer all show of feeling, which was a sort of file-biting and counter-irritant. And without his distinctly recognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him the sense that Celia would be there, and that he should pay her more attention than he had done before.|$|E
60|$|Other {{village at}} Framley there was none. At {{the back of}} the Court, up one of those cross-roads, there was another small shop or two, and there was a very neat cottage residence, in which lived the widow of a former curate, another protégé of Lady Lufton's; and there was a big, staring, brick house, in which the present curate lived; but this was a full mile distant from the church, and farther from Framley Court, {{standing}} on that cross-road which runs from Framley Cross <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from the mansion. This gentleman, the Rev.

On this account mercy was extended to the Rev. E. Jones, and, in spite of his red face and awkward big feet, he was invited to dine at Framley Court, with his plain daughter, once in every three months.|$|E
60|$|That night, as we lurked in the scullery, {{balanced}} between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt {{an urgent need}} of action I {{tried in vain to}} conceive some plan of escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> <b>away</b> from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would certainly have failed me.|$|E
