500|$|Hartman {{became one}} of the stars of the NBC sitcom NewsRadio in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being {{attracted}} by the show's writing and use of an ensemble cast, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with [...] "any ethics and character" [...] removed. Hartman made roughly $50,000 per episode of NewsRadio. Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, [...] "We seem to have limited appeal. We're on the edge here, not sure we're going to be picked up or not", but added he was [...] "99percent sure" [...] the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC's decision to repeatedly move NewsRadio into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, [...] "this is a sitcom, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> loud, not brain surgery". He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled [...] "it just will open up other opportunities for me". Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman died before production began. Ken Tucker praised Hartman's performance as McNeal: [...] "A lesser performer [...] would have played him as a variation on The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, because that's what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill's self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week." [...] Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on NewsRadio, but lost to David Hyde Pierce.|$|E
2500|$|Hannity {{is notable}} for his pro-Trump coverage. According to the Washington Post, [...] "Hannity’s {{comeback}} coincided with his early, eager embrace {{of his fellow}} New Yorker... Trump attacked the Gold Star father, and Hannity stood by him. Trump went after a federal judge of Mexican descent, and Hannity backed him. Even after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged of Trump boasting about grabbing women, Hannitydefended his guy: “King David had 500 concubines, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> loud.” After the inauguration, the first interview the new president gave to a cable news channel went to Hannity." [...] Hannity also defended the Trump administration's false claim that Trump’s inauguration crowd was the biggest ever.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} bans in Boston and Chicago drew {{criticism from}} some liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine said [...] "here's really {{no excuse for}} Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether {{you agree with the}} political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> loud. There's just nothing new here." [...] UCLA law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh observed, [...] "enying a private business permits because of such speech by its owner is a blatant First Amendment violation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

Don't believe him, my lord duke; he reads every word of it, the rogue! The boys about that {{magazine}} baste {{him as if he}} was a sack of oatmale. My reason <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out,</b> Sir Jan, was because you mintioned Fraser at all.

6000|$|... 'Baron! Lord Clifford, like my father! He {{was a man}} {{in steel}} armour; I {{remember}} how it rang, and how his gorget--yes, that was the thing round his throat--how it hurt me when he lifted me up to kiss me, and how they blamed me <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out.</b> Ay, and he lived in a castle with dark, dull, narrow chambers, all save the hall, where there was ever a tramping and a clamouring, and smells of hot burning meat, and horses, and all sorts of things, and they sat and sat over their meat and wine, and drank health to King Harry and the Red Rose. I mind now how they shouted and roared, and how I wanted to go and hide on the stairs, and my father would have me shout with them, and drink confusion to York out of his cup, and shook me and cuffed me when I cried. Oh! must one be like that to be a knight? I had rather live on these free green hills with the clear blue sky above me, and my good old ewe for my comrade'--and he fell to caressing the face of an old sheep which had come up to him, a white, mountain- bleached sheep with fine and delicate limbs. 'Yes, I love thee, good, gentle, little ewe, and thee, faithful Watch,' as a young collie pressed up to him, thrusting a long nose into his hand, 'far better than those great baying hounds, or the fierce-eyed hawks that only want to kill. If I be a baron, must it be in that sort? Avenge! avenge! what does that mean? Is it, as in Goodwife Dolly's ballads, going forth to kill? Why should I? I had rather let them be! Hark! Yea, Watch,' as the dog pricked his ears and raised his graceful head, then sprang up and uttered a deep-mouthed bark. The sheep darted away to her companions, and Hal rose to his feet, as the dog began to wave his tail, and Hob came forward accompanied by a tall, grave-looking gentleman. 'Here he be, sir. Hal, come thou and ask the blessing of thy knightly stepfather.' ...|$|E
