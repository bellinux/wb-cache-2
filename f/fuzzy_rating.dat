Cross impact analysis {{is seeking to}} find both direct and indirect relationships of variables relying on experts' decisions to structure and formalize judgmental forecasting. The knowledge is often uncertain or fuzzy when dealing with future events. In addition, experts prefer to use linguistic terms or fuzzy values in their predictions. Therefore, a qualitative cross impact analysis is represented in terms of fuzzy relationships. Four different approaches including crisp binary, crisp <b>rated,</b> <b>fuzzy</b> linguistic and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rated</b> are applied to a specific case [...] the security appliances sector. The results are then compared depending on the variables' characteristics. The fuzzy approaches reveal different results than the crisp ones. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rated</b> approach {{makes it possible to}} "infer in a wider perspective" from the results and pick out hidden variables. On the other hand, the results of the fuzzy linguistic approach help in deciding for variables where indecision is high in other approaches.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{modeling}} utility (rating) functions based on a novel concept called Fuzzy Operator Tree (FOT for short). As the notion suggests, this method makes use of techniques from fuzzy set theory and implements a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rating</b> function, that is, a utility function that maps to the unit interval, where 0 corresponds to the lowest and 1 to the highest evaluation. Even though the original motivation comes from quality control, FOTs are completely general and widely applicable. Our approach allows a human expert to specify a model {{in the form of}} an FOT in a quite convenient and intuitive way. To this end, he simply has to split evaluation criteria into sub-criteria in a recursive manner, and to determine in which way these sub-criteria ought to be combined: conjunctively, disjunctively, or by means of an averaging operator. The result of this process is the qualitative structure of the model. A second step, then, it is to parameterize the model.

30|$|To {{overcome}} the aforementioned limitations, much research effort has therefore been directed towards taking uncertainties (e.g., fuzzy sets and probability distributions) {{into account in}} the AHP. On one hand, to capture linguistic information, Yu [18] employed an absolute term linearization technique and a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rating</b> expression into a GP-AHP model for solving fuzzy AHP problems. Tolga et al. [13] combined the use of fuzzy set theory with the AHP to address the uncertainty of assigning crisp concepts in decision-making topics. Tesfamariam and Sadiq [19] incorporated uncertainty into the AHP using fuzzy arithmetic operations for environmental risk management. Chowdhury and Husain [8] integrated fuzzy set theory, the AHP, {{and the concept of}} entropy to select the best management plan for a drinking water facility. Kaya and Kahraman [10] proposed a hybrid fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE approach for modeling the uncertainty of linguistic expression. On the other hand, to deal with insufficient information and opinion difference in group decision-making processes, pairwise comparison elements were suggested to be viewed as random variables and computed via Monte Carlo simulation by Rosenbloom [16], Eskandari and Rabelo [20] and Jing et al. [21]. To date, triangular distribution is the most commonly used distribution for modeling expert judgment in the AHP [15, 22]. However, it may place too much emphasis on the most likely value {{at the expense of the}} values to either side [23]. It is possible to overcome this disadvantage of the triangular distribution by using the beta-PERT distribution. The beta-PERT distribution has also been widely used for modeling expert judgments and providing a close fit to normal distributions with less demand for data [24, 25]. Although various types of uncertainty have been discussed in the literature, there has been no study investigating the feasibility of incorporating both fuzzy and stochastic uncertainty into the AHP.|$|E

30|$|Failure rate {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} accurate (and most expensive) reliability analysis activities. An inaccurate estimation of failure rate leads to an inaccurate or incorrect evaluation of reliability, availability, MTTF, and MTBF of systems. In most cases, accelerated tests are utilized for accurate estimation of failure rates. It should be noted, however, that creating genuine conditions in these tests is considerably costly and sometimes not feasible. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider failure rate values as intervals. Upper bound, lower bound, and central values for failure rates and repair rate can be expressed through triangular fuzzy numbers. As a result, MTTF and MTBF adopt upper bound, lower bound, and central values as well. More specifically, independent failure rate and dependent failure rates each can be expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. The functioning condition of redundant systems causes them to undergo failure at different times. Therefore, it is possible to determine an interval for failure rate using previous failure data. In centrifugal water pumping redundant systems, <b>fuzzy</b> failure <b>rates</b> can also be collected by taking previous failure data into consideration. Repair rate can also be considered as triangular fuzzy numbers. In this case, the maintenance operator can determine an interval for the maintenance operation. Using the model presented in this paper, the MTBF of a redundant system with two types of dependent failures as well as <b>fuzzy</b> failure <b>rates</b> and <b>fuzzy</b> repair <b>rate</b> can be evaluated.|$|R

40|$|Chip {{control and}} tool wear {{estimation}} {{are two major}} concerns in automated machining systems. Chip control {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined part, the convenience of chip disposal, and possible power reduction; while tool wear estimation is vital to an effective tool change policy and quality control strategy, especially in finish-machining. This thesis first presents a new method for quantifying chip breaking and chip shapes with a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>rating</b> system, and further for predicting the chip breakability for arbitrary combinations of machining conditions through a fuzzy-set mathematical model. A predictive expert system for off-line assessment of machining performance, with chip control as a major criterion and due consideration to surface finish and power consumption, is then developed. A knowledge-based system for designing optimum chip breakers is set up with a criterion of efficient chip breaking at reduced power consumption. The method is based on the analysis of three-dimensional chip flow in oblique machining for a wide range of work materials, cutting conditions, tool geometries, chip breaker styles/sizes and restricted contact lengths. Experimental results of tool wear patterns in finish-machining show that estimation of more than one type of tool wear is required to assure the quality of a finished product. In order to achieve this, a dispersion analysis algorithm, derived from the established multivariate time series models, is used for the overall estimation of tool wear, including major flank wear, crater wear, minor flank wear and groove wear at the minor cutting edge. Finally, neural network techniques are used for modelling the dynamic interrelationship between the chip forming behaviour and different tool wear states. By integrating the developed methods for predicting chip breakability/shapes and for estimating comprehensive tool wear, the initially-predicted chip forming/breaking patterns can be updated with tool wear progression during the machining process through the use of neural network techniques. The results show that the methods developed in this thesis, for predicting chip breaking and shapes, and for evaluating machining performance, including chip control, surface finish and power consumption, m a y be used to form a basis for the off-line assessment of 2 ̆ 2 total machinability 2 ̆ 2 for automated machining systems. The strategy of comprehensive tool wear estimation provides a feasible means for on-line tool wear monitoring to assure product quality, especially under finish-machining conditions. The results also show that by using neural networks, chip forming behaviour with tool wear progression can be evaluated in-process, thus providing a feasible approach for achieving the on-line assessment of machining performance including chip forming patterns, surface finish and overall tool wear progression...|$|E
