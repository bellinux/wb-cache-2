500|$|Meanwhile, the French Directory sank in {{popularity}} after military defeats and mismanagement. Back in Paris, Sérurier {{became part of}} the Bonaparte faction, having seen nothing but disaster since serving under the military genius. Bonaparte launched the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 during which Sérurier led a reserve detachment of soldiers at the Pont-du-Jour. The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted the lawmakers from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, [...] "The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> soldiers; wait until you get orders". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use auxiliary battalions on 15 November 1799. He {{became a member of the}} Sénat conservateur (Senate) on 27 December.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Brumley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> He {{remained}} regarding {{her with}} a mournful expression.|$|R
60|$|Here he paused, but Ralph <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> and the {{brothers}} signed {{to him to}} proceed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will never}} see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid,' said they. 'Now get in, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> till you hear a crow calling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have watched}} here all day! They refused me {{admittance}} below. Beware of Wulf, of every one. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> from your chamber. There is {{a plot to}} carry you off to-night, and give you up to your brother the monk; you are betrayed; be brave!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, sir!" [...] said Naylor. [...] "Go down, if you will, when {{it grows}} light: but {{from this place}} you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> yet. Whatever you may think of our conduct to-night, you will thank us for it to-morrow morning, when you see where you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Alec {{was lying}} {{stretched}} out on the sofa, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> He seemed completely unconcerned.|$|R
60|$|Fanqua, {{who seemed}} to be her son, being sleepy, tipsy, stupid, or lazy, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b>|$|R
60|$|So utterly crushed was {{the poor}} wretch that even this insult <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> him to resentment.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; because he's belligerent," [...] I answered. [...] "It doesn't {{matter whether}} you believe or {{not if you}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> up controversy. Miller's 'suggestion' is adverse to the {{serenity}} of the psychic, that's all. The old-time sleepy back-parlor logic has no weight with me. Maxwell and Flammarion are my guides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> madam," [...] said Hampstead, {{for he had}} {{perceived}} {{from certain}} preparations made by Miss Fay that she would {{find it necessary to}} follow Mrs. Vincent out of the room. [...] "I will write two words for Roden, and that will tell him all I have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "We might be {{detained}} for doing murder. We have no proof yet of their intentions--I think--" [...] An idea flashed suddenly across my mind. [...] "Go {{back to your}} room, Ganymede," [...] I bade him. [...] "Lock yourself in, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> until I call you. I do not wish their suspicions aroused." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The girl is mad with terror, Borroughcliffe," [...] {{cried the}} colonel, bending his glistening eyes fondly on his niece, [...] "and {{you will have}} to furnish my good-for-nothing, gouty old person with a corporal's guard, to watch my nightcap, or the silly child will have an uneasy pillow, till the sun rises once more. But you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Leonard {{felt the}} rubbing {{of the ice}} burn him like hot iron. He felt also that his ankle was freed from the hand that had held it, then for some minutes he knew no more, for his senses left him. When they returned, it was to {{hear the voice of}} Otter crying, [...] "Lie still, lie still, Baas, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> for your life; I come." ...|$|E

60|$|Gregory, who {{had opened}} a letter, was seated {{with his head}} in his hands. The voice ceased, the {{typewriter}} ceased, but Gregory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> Both women, turning a little in their seats, glanced at him. Their eyes caught each other's and they looked away at once. A few seconds later they were looking at him again. Still Gregory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> An anxious appeal began to creep into the women's eyes.|$|R
60|$|There on {{the great}} high-backed carved oak chair by {{the right side of}} the {{fireplace}} sat an enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful eyes. He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> Then he made the motion of throwing something. Still it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel eyes shone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness.|$|R
6000|$|FOOL. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir!</b> He {{asked for}} a sign {{that you might be}} saved. [All are silent for a moment.] Look what has come from his mouth. ... a little winged thing ... a little shining thing. It has gone to the door.

6000|$|... "I {{will deliver}} it myself," [...] he announced. [...] "It will perhaps be safest. Until I return, Lucille, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> {{from the house}} or see any one. Muriel has given the {{servants}} orders to admit no one. All your life," [...] he added, after a moment's pause, [...] "you {{have been a little}} cruel to me, and this time also. I shall pray that you will relent before our next meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Save your wine, {{and your}} time too. Morella has cast me off, and I hate him, and wish {{to escape from}} him and rob him of his prize.

60|$|The {{figure of}} the girl seated in the big {{armchair}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir.</b> Her lips pouted contemptuously, a frown wrinkled her forehead.|$|R
60|$|Black Meg <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> {{only she}} {{produced}} a packet from {{the bosom of}} her dress {{and laid it on}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not grieve; it is a {{waste of}} {{precious}} time, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> till the end. I {{want you to know that}} I did not seek this death. I never dreamed of such a thing. You must tell my father so, and bid him not to mourn for me. It was my intention to leave the church within ten minutes of yourself. This cup is given to me by the hand of Fate. I did not fill it. Do you hear and understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In a tiny bay, on the {{opposite}} side of the island they found the very thing, which seemed to have been made on purpose for them; and as they were tired with their long walk, they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good night's rest, so as to be fresh for work next day. But before she went to sleep the girl turned to her husband, and said: 'If in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises, be sure you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir,</b> or get up to see what it is.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{there are}} no more quarrels, too. Old {{personal}} feuds, old party bickerings, old differences of creed, and hatreds {{in the name of the}} God of love—all those are past, in that world of which the Abbey is to me a symbol and a sacrament. Pitt and Fox, Warren Hastings and Macaulay, they can afford to be near to each other in the Abbey; for they understand each other now elsewhere; and the Romish Abbot’s bones <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>stir</b> in their grave beside the bones of the Protestant Divine whom he, it may be, would have burned alive on earth.|$|E
