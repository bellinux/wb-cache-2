5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people had been killed in accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the <b>domestic</b> <b>airline</b> Ansett-ANA.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} formed as Toa <b>Domestic</b> <b>Airlines</b> (Tōa Kokunai Kōkū) (TDA) in a merger between Toa Airways and Japan <b>Domestic</b> <b>Airlines</b> on May 15, 1971. It adopted the Japan Air System (JAS) name on April 1, 1988.|$|R
50|$|Toa Airways (Tōa Kōkū) was a Japanese {{airline and}} the {{predecessor}} of Japan Air System. Founded on November 30, 1953, it merged with Japan <b>Domestic</b> <b>Airlines</b> on May 15, 1971, to form Toa <b>Domestic</b> <b>Airlines,</b> which {{went on to}} become Japan Air System.|$|R
5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a <b>domestic</b> <b>airline,</b> {{and did not}} have international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that the SAS-cooperation was weak, and that either a full merger or a discontinuation of the cooperation would be necessary. Braathen suggested to the government that DNL, Fred. Olsen Airtransport and Braathens SAFE should merge {{to create a new}} <b>domestic</b> <b>airline,</b> but this proposal was rejected by both DNL and Fred. Olsen. In 1949, the Swedish branch of SAS, Aerotransport (ABA), and the Danish branch, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) started a joint route to the Far East. For a merger to be completed, Danish and Swedish authorities required that SAS be granted all international routes from Norway, meaning that Braathens SAFE would lose its concession from 1 March 1954. The SAS merger was completed on 8 August 1951.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. <b>domestic</b> <b>airline</b> market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E

5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the <b>domestic</b> <b>airline</b> market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Braathens SAFE started {{negotiations}} {{to purchase the}} Swedish airline Transwede Airways from its owners, Transpool. After SAS had bought Linjeflyg, Transwede had become the second-largest <b>domestic</b> <b>airline</b> in Sweden, operating five Fokker 100s. In 1995, Braathens SAFE had a revenue of NOK4 billion, with a profit of NOK242 million. The same year, Transwede had lost NOK200 million with a revenue of NOK1.2 billion. The company had been split in two, a charter and a scheduled company, and Braathens SAFE started negotiating to purchase the scheduled company. Transwede's scheduled services were at the time form Stockholm-Arlanda Airport to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, plus a service from Luleå to Sundsvall. It had a 13% market share, transporting 800,000 people in 1995, and had been through a major restructuring the year before, where the fleet had been reduced from seven to five aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{measures of}} {{total factor productivity}} for Australian domestic air transport {{over the past two}} decades, and enables comparisons to be made with the productivity of international airlines. In recent years there has been little by way of measurement of productivity performance of the Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>airlines.</b> A major reason for this has been the poor availability of data [...] data typically available for international airlines are no longer available for the Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>airlines.</b> Strictly speaking, it is no longer possible to measure total factor productivity for the <b>domestic</b> <b>airlines,</b> as critical data are missing. It is possible, however, to fill in the gaps with proxies, which enable useful, albeit imperfect, productivity measures to be developed. These can also be compared to published measures for international airlines. The results enable an assessment of the productivity performance of Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>airlines</b> {{over the past two decades}} (and especially over the post deregulation period). They also enable an assessment of the extent to which productivity has caught up with that achieved in well performing airlines overseas. The results also show light on whether there is scope for new airlines, such as the proposed entrant Virgin, to achieve lower costs than the incumbents. ...|$|R
