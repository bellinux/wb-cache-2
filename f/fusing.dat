5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell <b>fusing</b> hydrogen; the next shell <b>fusing</b> helium, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen <b>fusing</b> into helium, surrounding a layer of helium <b>fusing</b> into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium.

50|$|In IEC standards, the {{replaceable}} {{element is}} called a <b>fuse</b> link and the assembly of <b>fuse</b> link and <b>fuse</b> holder {{is called a}} <b>fuse.</b> North American standards call the replaceable element only the <b>fuse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the <b>fuse</b> holder is displaced and the <b>fuse</b> holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the <b>fuse</b> blows. Mechanical tension on the <b>fuse</b> link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the <b>fuse</b> blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the <b>fuse</b> link out of the <b>fuse</b> holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> holder. This quenches any arc in the <b>fuse</b> holder.|$|R

5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772.

2500|$|In North America, <b>fuses</b> {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base <b>fuses</b> would screw into a <b>fuse</b> socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of <b>fuses</b> with an excessive current rating, later <b>fuse</b> boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S <b>fuses)</b> which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the <b>fuse.</b> This means that <b>fuses</b> can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) <b>fuse</b> rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison <b>fuse</b> boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) <b>fuses,</b> by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter.
