40|$|Abstract — Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANet) are a spon-taneous {{collection of}} mobile terminals. Each node must collaborate {{in order to}} structure information exchange. An hybrid network is a MANet connected to Internet via an Access Point (AP). We propose to organize MANet and hybrid networks through a virtual topology. We consider a virtual topology as a hierarchical organization based on the integration of both backbone and clusters. Construction and maintenance procedures of such a virtual topology are detailed and deal with robustness and reliability issues. We present a proactive gratuitous maintenance for our backbone and a new maintenance algorithm for clusters presenting a reduced overhead. Moreover, this improved solution allows to integrate multiple APs in hybrid net-works, deleting the previous single point of <b>failure.</b> A method <b>to</b> <b>interconnect</b> backbones is described, which is useful for many applications.
