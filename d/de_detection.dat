40|$|Objective: Case series have {{identified}} that de novo intracranial aneurysms occur. However, {{the risk for}} this occurrence has not been established. We examined the risk for the de novo intracranial aneurysm detection in a consecutive surgical case series. Methods: A prospectively collected surgical database of intracranial aneurysms was retrospectively examined. Patients were analyzed if they were followed for more than 6 months postoperatively with angiography. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of <b>de</b> novo aneurysms <b>detection</b> included the comparison of smoking vs. never smoked; those with and without a family history; single vs. multiple aneurysms at initial presentation; and original presentation with rupture vs. nonrupture. Results: Of the 1366 surgically treated patients (1942 aneurysms), 472 patients (702 aneurysms) were followed with angiography for more than 6 months (average, 54 months). Thirty-three patients (6. 99 %) were detected to have de novo aneurysms. Multivariate analysis found a smoking history significantly {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>de</b> novo aneurysm <b>detection.</b> Kaplan-Meier analysis found the 5 - and 10 -year <b>de</b> novo aneurysm <b>detection</b> rate to be 4. 21 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 86 - 12. 8) and 15 % (95 % CI 10 - 16), respectively. A smoking history increases the 5 - and 10 -year detection rate to 5. 81 % and 17 % (hazard ratio 2. 58; 95 % CI 1. 13 - 5. 90) respectively. No increased risk was present for an initial presentation that included multiple aneurysms, a family history, or rupture. Conclusion: There is a 10 -year <b>de</b> novo aneurysm <b>detection</b> rate of between 10 % and 16 % after surgery.

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in differentiating diseased and normal samples using biomarkers derived from mass spectrometry (MS) studies. However, biomarker identification for specific diseases has been hindered by irreproducibility. Specifically, a peak profile extracted from a dataset for biomarker identification depends on a data preprocessing algorithm. Until now, no widely accepted agreement has been reached. Results: In this paper, we investigated the consistency of biomarker identification using differentially expressed (DE) peaks from peak profiles produced by three widely used average spectrum-dependent pre-processing algorithms based on SELDI-TOF MS data for prostate and breast cancers. Our results revealed two important factors that affect the consistency of DE peak identification using different algorithms. One factor is that some DE peaks selected from one peak profile were not detected as peaks in other profiles, and the second factor is that the statistical power of identifying DE peaks in large peak profiles with many peaks may be low due to the large scale of the tests and small number of samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the <b>DE</b> peak <b>detection</b> power in large profiles could be improved by the stratified false discovery rate (FDR) control approach and that the reproducibility of <b>DE</b> peak <b>detection</b> could thereby be increased. Conclusions: Comparing and evaluating pre-processing algorithms in terms of reproducibility can elucidate the relationship among different algorithms and also help in selecting a pre-processing algorithm.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the global organization and internal structure of motifs in higher eukaryotic organisms raises significant challenges for motif detection techniques. To achieve successful <b>de</b> novo motif <b>detection</b> {{it is necessary to}} model the complex dependencies within and among motifs and incorporate biological prior knowledge. In this paper, we present LOGOS, an integrated LOcal and GlObal motif Sequence model for biopolymer sequences, which provides a principled framework for developing, modularizing, extending and computing expressive motif models for complex biopolymer sequence analysis. LOGOS consists of two interacting submodels: HMDM, a local alignment model capturing biological prior knowledge and positional dependence within the motif local structure; and HMM, a global motif distribution model modeling frequencies and dependencies of motif occurrences. Model parameters can be fit using training motifs within an empirical Bayesian framework. A variational EM algorithm is developed for <b>de</b> novo motif <b>detection.</b> LOGOS improves over existing models that ignore biological priors and dependencies in motif structures and motif occurrences, and demonstrates superior performance on both semi-realistic test data and cisregulatory sequences from yeast data with regard to sensitivity, specificity, flexibility and extensibility. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{learning}} of global genetic regulatory networks from expression data is a severely under-constrained {{problem that is}} aided by reducing the dimensionality of the search space by means of clustering genes into putatively co-regulated groups, {{as opposed to those}} that are simply co-expressed. Be cause genes may be co-regulated only across a subset of all observed experimental conditions, biclustering (clustering of genes and conditions) is more appropriate than standard clustering. Co-regulated genes are also often functionally (physically, spatially, genetically, and/or evolutionarily) associated, and such a priori known or pre-computed associations can provide support for appropriately grouping genes. One important association is the presence of one or more common cis-regulatory motifs. In organisms where these motifs are not known, their <b>de</b> novo <b>detection,</b> integrated into the clustering algorithm, can help to guide the process towards more biologically parsimonious solutions. Results We have developed an algorithm, cMonkey, that detects putative co-regulated gene groupings by integrating the biclustering of gene expression data and various functional associations with the <b>de</b> novo <b>detection</b> of sequence motifs. Conclusion We have applied this procedure to the archaeon Halobacterium NRC- 1, as part of our efforts to decipher its regulatory network. In addition, we used cMonkey on public data for three organisms in the other two domains of life: Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli. The biclusters detected by cMonkey both recapitulated known biology and enabled novel predictions (some for Halobacterium were subsequently confirmed in the laboratory). For example, it identified the bacteriorhodopsin regulon, assigned additional genes to this regulon with apparently unrelated function, and detected its known promoter motif. We have performed a thorough comparison of cMonkey results against other clustering methods, and find that cMonkey biclusters are more parsimonious with all available evidence for co-regulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is {{becoming}} increasingly popular for quantifying gene expression levels.

40|$|Background: Concern {{has been}} raised that the {{workload}} of community pharmacists (CPs) {{is linked to the}} occurrence of dispensing errors (DEs). One aspect of workload that has not yet been measured in this setting, but has been linked to errors in other industries, is mental workload (MWL). Aims: (1) Measure the relationship between MWL and DEs during a routine pharmacy task, the final accuracy check, which research suggests is critical to DE prevention. (2) Quantify the role that expertise plays in this relationship. (3) Explore CPs and pharmacy students’ experiences of MWL and DEs. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken and three studies were conducted. In study one, CPs (n= 104) and students (n= 93) checked dispensed items for DEs. Participants took part in one of four conditions (distraction, no distraction, dual-task or single-task) and their <b>DE</b> <b>detection</b> and MWL was measured. Study two was a diary study of CPs’ (n= 40) MWL during a day in their “real-life” practice. Study three presented an interpretative phenomenological analysis of CPs’ (n= 14) and students’ (n= 15) experiences of MWL and DEs. Main findings: Study one found that high MWL was related to reduced <b>DE</b> <b>detection,</b> but only for students, confirming the important role of expertise. Distractions did not affect <b>DE</b> <b>detection</b> but was linked to increased MWL. Study 2 highlighted specific times of the day when CPs’ MWL was exceptionally high.
