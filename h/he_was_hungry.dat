5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E
25|$|In August 1992, Otter {{was pulled}} over on Interstate 84 near Meridian for {{suspicion}} of {{driving under the}} influence. He said the arresting officer observed him swerving as he was reaching for his cowboy hat, which had been blown off by the wind in his open car. Otter offered several explanations for failing the field sobriety test including: his stocking feet were stung by weeds and gravel, he had run eight miles (13km) and his knee hurt, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> {{and that he had}} soaked his chewing tobacco in Jack Daniel's. A jury convicted Otter in March 1993, and he was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and 16 hours at an alcohol treatment program, fined $700, and had his license revoked.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 he {{emigrated from}} Iran {{with his brother}} to India, in search of {{economic}} opportunities among the long-established Parsi community. After brief employment in Bombay, he gave away {{most of the money}} he had saved and resumed his mystical quest. He wandered through Gujarat and Sindh among other places for another ten years, begging only when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry.</b> Disappointed that nearly two decades of dervishi had not led him to spiritual realization, he returned to Bombay where his sister Piroja now lived. Slowly integrating into conventional life, he reluctantly became betrothed to a young girl, Shireen Khuramshahi, whose family had also immigrated from his birthplace. The marriage took place 8 years later in 1892 when Shireen came of age: she was 14 and Sheriar 39. To support his new lifestyle he became first a gardener and later the owner of a successful palm wine business in Poona (present-day Pune) where the couple moved in 1893. In all Sheriar and Shireen had nine children – seven sons and two daughters. Of these, three died in childhood: one son Shirmund at seven months, a second Jehangir at two years, and a daughter Freiny who died of plague at age six in 1902.|$|E

25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

For a while George was left at Cliff's stables until his father decided to send George to his alma mater facilitated by his winnings. Moore's formal education started at St. Mary's College, Oscott, a Catholic boarding school near Birmingham where he was the youngest of 150 boys. He spent all of 1864 at home, having contracted a lung infection brought about by a breakdown in his health. His academic performance was poor while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and unhappy. In January 1865, he returned to St. Mary's College with his brother Maurice, where he refused to study as instructed and spent time reading novels and poems. That December the principal, Spencer Northcote, wrote a report that: [...] "he hardly knew what to say about George." [...] By the summer of 1867 he was expelled, for (in his own words) 'idleness and general worthlessness', and returned to Mayo.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Augustine {{was sent}} to school at Madaurus (now M'Daourouch), a small Numidian city about [...] south of Thagaste. There he became {{familiar}} with Latin literature, as well as pagan beliefs and practices. His first insight {{into the nature of}} sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, The Confessions. He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> but because [...] "it was not permitted." [...] His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself." [...] From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.|$|E
2500|$|While {{on the way}} to Haridwar, in September 1888, Narendra {{stayed at}} Hathras. There in the railway waiting room Narendra met Sharat Chandra Gupta, a railway station master. Gupta went to Narendra and asked if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> to which he got a reply in positive. He took Narendra to his home. When Narendra asked him what food he was going to offer, Gupta quoted a Persian poem in reply: [...] "Oh beloved, I shall prepare the most delicious dish with the flesh of my heart". Narendra told Gupta that he had a great mission in life— he wanted to serve his motherland where {{starvation}} and poverty stalk millions of people. He narrated his dream of seeing India regaining her old glory. During the conversations Gupta asked Narendra if he could help him anyhow. Narendra immediately replied— [...] "Yes, take up the kamandalu and go begging". Gupta understood that he was being asked to renounce his personal interest for the welfare of many. He decided to renounce the world and became a disciple of Narendranath. Narendra and Gupta left Hathras together.|$|E

His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and have plenty to eat all the time, much of the time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and could not buy medicine or go to the doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want.
