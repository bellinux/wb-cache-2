To offer a deeper insight into this data the simultaneous visualization of these images, not regarding their source, must be provided.

Skin impressions from {{various parts of the}} body of two species of the hadrosaurine Saurolophus (S. angustirostris from Mongolia and S. osborni from Canada) are described from multiple specimens. These species, recently validated on osteological grounds, can be differentiated based solely on soft-tissue anatomy, namely scale shape and pattern.

Moreover, implants from different suppliers were also tested to study its impact on tracking accuracy. The calibration methodology and the algorithms employed proved to implement a suitable strategy for the evaluation of novel dental impression techniques. However, in the particular case of the evaluated electromagnetic tracking system, the order of magnitude of the obtained errors invalidates its use for the full-arch modeling of implant-supported prosthesis...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the results}} of the study {{indicated}} that higher voter turnouts occurred when one candidate is disliked to the point of being a threat to voters, while the other is perceived as a hero. However, subjects who liked both candidates were not as likely to vote, even if they liked one significantly more than the other. This also holds true for subjects who disliked both candidates because in these cases voters would be happy or unhappy with either outcome. The studies also indicated that mudslinging in political campaigns effectively increased voter turnout, provided that candidates vilified their opponents tastefully without tarnishing their own image. The study also revealed that if people liked or disliked the candidate at the first encounter, their opinion was difficult to change later on. In fact, Krosnick's studies show that people become more resistant to changing their views as they learn more and more about a candidate. At the start of a campaign, most candidates are viewed in a mildly positive light. After presenting their <b>positions,</b> <b>impressions</b> of candidates solidify and information gained earlier in the campaign tends to have a greater impact.

40|$|To date, {{the vast}} {{literature}} on theories of psychology, and psychology as a practice, still remains {{a reflection of}} Western experiences and conceptions of reality. This is so despite "psychology" and "psychotherapy" being studied and implemented by Africans, dealing with Africa's existential issues, in Africa. In this context, a distorted <b>impression</b> that <b>positions</b> psychology and psychotherapy as irreplaceable and irrefutable Western discoveries is created. This perception creates a tendency in which psychotherapists adopt and use universalised, foreign and imposed theories to explain and deal with African cultural experiences. In recent years, African scholars' quest to advance "African-brewed" conceptions, definitions and practices of "psychology" and "psychotherapy" is gaining momentum. Psychologists dealing with African clients are increasingly confronted with the difficulty, {{and in some instances}} the impossibility, of communicating with, and treating local clients using Western conceptions and theories. Adopting the dominant Western epistemological and scientific paradigms constitutes epistemological oppression and alienation. Instead, African conceptions, definitions and practices of "psychology" and "psychotherapy" based on African cultural experiences, epistemology and ontology are argued for. The thesis defended in this study is that the dominant Western paradigm of scientific knowledge in general and, psychology in particular, is anchored in a defective claim to neutrality, objectivity and universality. To demonstrate this, indigenous ways of knowing and doing in the African experience are counterpoised against the Western understanding and construction of scientific knowledge in the fields of psychology and psychotherapy. The conclusion arising from our demonstration is the imperative to rethink psychology and psychotherapy in order to (i) affirm the validity of indigenous African ways of knowing and doing; (ii) show that the exclusion of the indigenous African ways of knowing and doing from the Western paradigm illustrates the tenuous and questionable character of its epistemological and methodological claims to neutrality, objectivity and universality. Indeed the Western claim to scientific knowledge, as described, speaks to its universality {{at the expense of the}} ineradicable as well as irreducible v ontological pluriversality of the human experience. This study's aim is to advance the argument for the sensitivity to pluriversality of be-ing and the imperative for wholistic thinking. PsychologyD. Phil. (Psychology...|$|R

However, there is little clinical evidence to support or refute its use. The aim of this prospective {{clinical study}} was to evaluate the occlusion and marginal fit of posterior full crowns made from double-arch impressions, and to compare these to control crowns fabricated from conventional complete-arch impressions. Methods: Ten patients requiring single posterior ceramo-metal full crowns had both double-arch and complete-arch impressions taken of the prepared tooth. Two crowns were fabricated for each tooth, using the casts made from both impression methods. Both crowns were tried in and the occlusion and margins evaluated. The results were composed using nonparametric statistical analysis with the probability level for significance at a= 0. 05. Results: The crowns fabricated from the double-arch impression were found to be more accurate in closure to the intercuspal position and had fewer interferences in lateral excursions. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two crown groups regarding protrusive interferences and margin quality.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : The {{evaluation}} of alveolar bone healing {{may have a}} role in dental implantology, in prosthodontics in the post-extraction phase and in monitoring fracture repair. There are several radiological techniques described to evaluate alveolar bone regeneration. However, most are expensive and time consuming. OBJECTIVES : To develop and evaluate a radiological method utilising readily available equipment to measure alveolar bone regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS : An apparatus was designed to enable the acquisition of standardized x-ray images, consisting of a disposable <b>impression</b> tray, digital <b>positioning</b> system, aluminum step wedge, digital x-ray sensor, Rinn apparatus and laboratory putty. Bone biopsies were collected from each oral quadrant in each of five Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Accurately standardised x-ray images of the biopsy sites were taken pre-operatively, directly post-operatively and again after three and six week intervals. These images were analysed using a graded histogram provided in a computer software program. RESULTS : The average gray-scale value on the histogram of the selected biopsy area was determined on the series of standardised images. The average values for the three biopsied sites per quadrant were expressed as percentages of pre-operative density. The results indicated a mean increase of 6. 3 % (± 1. 4 %) (mean ± 1 SEM) in bone density after three weeks and 12. 6 % (± 1. 7 %) six weeks post-operatively. CONCLUSION : A standardised radiological examination method was developed which, together with a computerised evaluation technique, could be applied to accurately determine relative bone density. This method was shown to provide comparative bone density values during the regeneration process of alveolar bone over a six week period. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{who have}} {{suffered}} obstetric brachial plexus injury (OBPI) have {{a high incidence of}} musculoskeletal complications stemming from the initial nerve injury. The presence of muscle imbalances and contractures leads to typical bony changes affecting the shoulder, including the SHEAR (Scapular Hypoplasia, Elevation and Rotation) deformity. The SHEAR deformity commonly occurs in conjunction with Medial Rotation Contracture (MRC) of the arm. OBPI also causes muscle imbalances {{at the level of the}} forearm, that lead to a fixed supination deformity (SD) in a small number of patients. Both MRC and SD will cause severe functional limitations without surgical intervention. Methods Fourteen OBPI patients were diagnosed with MRC of the shoulder and SD of the forearm along with SHEAR deformity during a 16 month study period, with eight patients available to long-term follow-up (age range 2. 2 – 18 years). Surgical correction of the MRC was performed as a triangle tilt or humeral osteotomy depending on the age of the child, after which, the patients were treated with a radial osteotomy to correct the fixed supination deformity. Function was assessed using the modified Mallet scale, examination of apparent supination and appearance of the extremity at rest. Results Significant functional improvements were observed in patients with surgical reconstruction. Mallet score increased by an average of 5. 2 (p Conclusion The simultaneous presence of two opposing deformities in the same limb will visually offset each other at the level of the wrist and hand, giving the false <b>impression</b> of neutral <b>positioning</b> of the limb. In reality, the neutral-appearing position of the hand indicates a fixed supination posture of the forearm in the face of a medial rotation contracture of the shoulder. Both of these deformities require surgical attention, and the presence of concurrent MRC and SD should be monitored for in OBPI patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Part A of the thesis, {{the concept}} of {{hardness}} and its measurements are briefly reviewed at the beginning. Micro-hardness {{and its relation to}} crystal properties is also discussed. Micro-hardness test indentations with the double cone made on the (0001) plane of cleaved single crystals of zinc are measured and the variation of hardness with direction is studied. The value of hardness repeats itself for every 60 degrees due to the six fold symmetry of the basal plane. The observations are not in conformity with theory. The distortion around the impressions is studied by multiple-beam interferometry using the microflat technique. Kink traces on a microscopic scale are very clearly shown by phase contrast microscopy. The extent of the region of kink traces belonging to different kink systems, with the different positions of the indenter is revealed and discussed. Micro-twins are observed at the tips of the <b>impression</b> for certain <b>positions</b> only. An X-ray study of the disordered region around the impression was also made and is discussed. Clear evidence for the process of polygonization is seen after annealing at 380 °C for 2 hours. In Part B, the equilibrium diagrams of binary alloys is briefly reviewed. The different theories of cathode sputtering are discussed. This technique of etching by the bombardment of positive ions using the metal to be etched as the cathode in a glow discharge, is described. Tin and tin-indium alloys of low indium percentages are etched after different heat treatments and a metallographic study is made. The different phases observed are discussed. The results do not agree with the equilibrium diagram determined by Rhines, Urquhart and Hoge. Many interesting features are observed {{during the course of the}} microscopic examination and these are discussed. An optical method for determining the rate of etching is given. <p...|$|R
500|$|On 28 May the {{regiment}} had to man a position just {{captured by the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles, called No.3 Post. The 6th Squadron was chosen and started improving the trenches on arrival. Daylight was at 03:30 and although having worked all night, they had made no real <b>impression</b> on the <b>position</b> and were exposed to Turkish fire all day. However, instead of abandoning the post, at 21:00 they were relieved by the 9th Squadron. An hour later Major Selwyn Chambers, commanding the 9th Squadron reported they were surrounded by about one thousand Turkish troops. At 23:35 communications with the 9th Squadron failed. The squadron were fighting off attacks, but could not stop Turkish troops reaching {{the edge of their}} trench and throwing hand grenades into their positions. A troop from the 2nd Squadron, sent as reinforcements, were unable to break through. So at midnight the remainder of the 2nd Squadron attempted to reach them, but instead had to dig in to defend themselves. Even though outnumbered, both squadrons managed to hold out, [...] providing covering fire for each other. At 03:30 another Turkish attempt to capture their trenches began, this time from the south. When Turkish troops got into {{the left side of the}} 2nd Squadron trench, Major James Elmslie led a troop in a counter-attack, clearing them out. At 06:30, by using signal flags, communications with regimental headquarters were re-established. Casualties were mounting and supplies of ammunition dwindling, and the defence was becoming untenable. The 6th Squadron managed to reach the 2nd Squadron's position, but in the face of heavy Turkish fire, were unable to advance any further. Around 12:00 Turkish troops got into the 9th Squadrons trenches, forcing one troop to withdraw. After Captain Spragg of 9th Squadron located an abandoned supply of British ammunition, the New Zealanders were able to return fire at will without having to conserve ammunition. Nevertheless, the Turkish force, now numbering about three thousand men, continued their attacks all day.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the mandibular displacement from three methods of centric relation record using an anterior jig associated with (A) chin point guidance, (B) swallowing (control group) and (C) bimanual manipulation. Ten patients aged 25 - 39 years were selected if they met the following inclusion criteria: complete dentition (up {{to the second}} molars), Angle class I and absence of {{signs and symptoms of}} temporomandibular disorders and diagnostic casts showing stability in the maximum intercuspation (MI) <b>position.</b> <b>Impressions</b> of maxillary and mandibular arches were made with an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material. Master casts of each patient were obtained, mounted on a microscope table in MI as a reference position and 5 records of each method were made per patient. The mandibular casts were then repositioned with records interposed and new measurements were obtained. The difference between the two readings allowed measuring the displacement of the mandible in the anteroposterior and lateral axes. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. There was no statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) among the three methods for measuring lateral displacement (A= 0. 38 ± 0. 26, B= 0. 32 ± 0. 25 and C= 0. 32 ± 0. 23). For the anteroposterior displacement (A= 2. 76 ± 1. 43, B= 2. 46 ± 1. 48 and C= 2. 97 ± 1. 51), the swallowing method (B) differed significantly from the others (p 0. 05) was found between chin point guidance (A) and bimanual manipulation (C). In conclusion, the swallowing method produced smaller mandibular posterior displacement than the other methods. Este estudo comparou o deslocamento mandibular a partir de 3 métodos de registro da relação cêntrica usando um jig anterior associado com: (A) guia da ponta do mento; (B) deglutição grupo controle (C) manipulação bimanual. As moldagens dos arcos maxilares e mandibulares foram feitas com hidrocolóide irreversível. Os modelos de estudo de cada paciente foram obtidos e montados em máxima intercuspidação como uma posição de referência no microscópio. Foram obtidos 5 registros de cada método em 10 pacientes. Os modelos mandibulares foram reposicionados com os registros interpostos e novas medidas foram obtidas. A diferença entre as duas leituras permitiu a medida do deslocamento mandibular nos eixos ântero-posterior e laterais. ANOVA não demonstrou diferença estatisticamente significativa entre os 3 métodos em relação ao registro do deslocamento lateral (A = 0, 38 ± 0, 26, B = 0, 32 ± 0, 25 e C = 0, 32 ± 0, 23). Quanto ao deslocamento anteroposterior, ANOVA e o teste de Tukey (a= 0, 05) indicaram diferença estatisticamente significante entre os três métodos (A= 2, 76 ± 1, 43, B= 2, 46 ± 1, 48 e C= 2, 97 ± 1, 51). Não houve diferença estatisticamente significante entre A e C. A deglutição propiciou menor deslocamento mandibular posterior que os outros métodos...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} depiction of the nobility in ten romances composed in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It looks into {{the extent of the}} nobility’s power in these texts, {{and the ways in which}} this power is evoked. It is likely the first study to use a theoretical framework based on the work of the sociologist Michael Mann in the analysis of Middle English literature. Mann’s theory distinguishes between four forms of social power: economic, military, ideological and political. Political power is rarely evident in the corpus and therefore only incidentally features here. In the treatment of ideological power, a distinction is made between ideological power enjoyed within the context of the romance itself and ideological power enjoyed in the ‘real world’ outside the text. The romances in the corpus are King Horn, Havelok, Sir Degaré the Northern Octavian, Sir Launfal, Sir Amadace, Sir Cleges, Roswall and Lillian, The Taill of Rauf Coilyear and The Squyr of Lowe Degre. They were selected on the basis of two criteria. Firstly, were social contrasts in individual romances sufficiently evident for effective analysis to be possible even without very specific historical contexts from which to read them. Secondly, was there a temporal spread which might allow for conclusions to be drawn on the influence of specific socio?historical contexts on the worlds portrayed in the romances of the corpus. The application of Mann’s theory to the corpus produces a rich image. The image of the nobleman as a mounted warrior appears in each of the romances, testifying to the influence this image exerted over medieval conceptions of the nobility. After c. 1350, it lost much of its connection with reality as mounted warfare diminished in importance. The romances also share their portrayal of the monarch as a central figure. Some of the works espouse notions of the nobility’s engagement with military activity which clearly deny or ignore the realities of high and late medieval society. In such romances, the ideological power which the nobility enjoyed over the author and/or individuals in their environment appears to have partly suppressed realisations which challenged an exclusive association of the nobility with military power. In two romances, non-nobles can become knights and even powerful barons. Yet in three of the romances we find clear suggestions that nobility ultimately rests on factors which lie beyond human society. The notion that nobility is innate runs counter to thirteenth-, fourteenth- and fifteenth-century practice. Ideology here suppresses realistic perceptions of the social mechanisms that surrounded the nobility. Three of the romances point to the economic vulnerability of noble lords by indicating that boundless munificence need not equate having boundless resources. The romances in the corpus display considerable variety in their evocation of noble power, even to the extent of allowing one to gather a nuanced <b>impression</b> of noble <b>positions.</b> At the same time, they point to a future in which the notion of the knight as a heavily armed warrior on horseback moved into the realm of fancy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study some {{various aspects of the}} modern digital workflow to produce Fixed Dental Prostheses (FDP) : from the optical impression, directly in the mouth, to the finalization of the prosthetic device specific for the patient. The motivation of this study is related to the growing need around the dental world to optimize and modernize the workflows that are still essentially artisanal. Taking advantage of modern digital technologies, that are rapidly spreading in the dental field, it is possible to obtain products with the highest quality standards, with lower production costs. Moreover it is important to spread the knowledge and skills to the dentists and to the dental technicians for an optimal use of these knowledges. In particular, we have have taken into consideration the following issues of distinct particular clinical importance: - optical intraoral scanning technology: specific operative and technical performance of these digital devices were investigated with particular reference to edentulous patients who need a full-arch implants rehabilitation, - innovative ceramic materials, used to produce metalfree multilayer bridges on natural teeth using Cad-Cam technology. It was also investigated an innovative resin composite material, which is also workable with Cad-Cam technology and used for the production of single crowns on implants. The revision of the scientific literature, suggested goals and metrological aspects of the experimental program of this research. The investigations, have evaluated precision and accuracy aspects of the optical <b>impression</b> of implants <b>position,</b> the geometric coupling precision of the multilayer metal free bridge components, mechanical resistance of different types of materials, and adhesion between a recent Cad-Cam resin composite referred as, Resin Nano-Ceramic (RNC) and zirconia. Moreover the introduction of instruments and methods established in the technical-scientific field, has been provided suitable to characterize the manufacturing processes used, the materials used and the devices manufactured. More in detail, the activities involved: 1. the study, in terms of metrological performance, of the acquisition process performed by the True Definition Scanner using a clinical sample reproducing a fully edentulous arch rehabilitated with 6 implants, 2. the verification of the geometric precision of the coupling component, sub and superstructure, of multilayer metalfree bridges made with different ceramic materials (zirconia-lithium disilicate), produced by Cad-Cam technology, and assembled by two different operators; the assembly / union of the bridge components, is instead carried out manually by the dental technicians totally handmade; 3. the analysis of the mechanical behavior, static, of the multilayer metalfree bridges, cited in paragraph 2, compared with another type of multilayer prosthesis (from the same Cad projects) but made with zirconia and glass ceramic (RLT), 4. the analysis by mechanical test, both static and under fatigue, of an innovative composite material resin supplied in blocks for Cad-Cam processing: Lava Ultimate. This new composite material presents, mechanical properties (Young's modulus), more similar to the natural tooth, compared to other aesthetic materials. For this reason, it was used to produce single crowns on implants comparing two different modes of use: cementing a composite crown produced with Cad-Cam technology directly on a titanium standard abutment supplied by industry, or producing a Cad-Cam zirconia customized abutment and cementing the composite crown to this; 5. verification of bonding capacity between zirconia and Lava Ultimate, using two different resin cements by means of shear bond test. Based on the results of the test campaigns conducted in this study it can be stated that: 1 technologies of digital intraoral optical impression are able to fulfill the clinical requirements of precision even in the case of full arch implants rehabilitations, 2. multilayer metalfree bridges, made with Cad-Cam technology according to the precision requirements of digital workflow, are affected by the intervention of the dental technician during the final assembly of the bridge components, resulting in reduced quality of precision established in the Cad phase, 3 multilayer metalfreee bridges show fracture toughness values {{greater than or equal to}} the minimum values reported in the scientific literature, 4. the implants crowns made with the innovative composite material subjected to strength tests and fatigue resistance, when cemented on an customized zirconia abutment, have superior mechanical characteristics than the cheapest solution, which provides the composite crown cementation directly to a standardized titanium abutment, 5. the use of adhesive cements for luting Lava Ultimate on zirconia, allowed to highlight the opposite results regards the strenght of adhesion, measured by means of the shear bond test...|$|R
