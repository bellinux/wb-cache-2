50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely <b>fired,</b> <b>voltages</b> everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.|$|R

An average value of leakage current through {{the surface of the}} pilot insulator in a duration is measured, for this {{is a function of the}} quantity of salt adhered and its moisture content. In each cycle, the program signals give one by one the instructions on a start and an end of the integration of leakage current, a detection of the integrated value, a stop of the washing device and a reset of the integrator. The integrator consists of RC circuit and the main detecting part consists of the thyristor whose <b>firing</b> gate <b>voltage</b> is used as a reference value. If the integrator output rises above the <b>firing</b> gate <b>voltage,</b> the pulse signals are made in the signal conversion part at the same time that the thyristor turns on, which are distributed to the pump motor or the electromagnetic valve.

The conclusions are summarized as follows. (1) An average value of leakage current is justified to be the detecting variable.

Similar to direct blockade of HCN channels, α 2 -NA receptor stimulation produced a significant enhancement in temporal summation during trains of distally evoked EPSPs. These dual effects of α 2 -NA receptor stimulation – membrane hyperpolarization and enhanced temporal integration – together produce an increase in the overall gain of the response of PFC pyramidal neurons to excitatory synaptic input.

40|$|Chronic neuropathic pain {{resulting}} from neuronal damage remains difficult to treat, in part, because of incomplete understanding of underlying cellular mechanisms. We have previously shown that inward Ca 2 + flux (I(Ca)) across the sensory neuron plasmalemma is decreased in a rodent model of chronic neuropathic pain, but the direct {{consequence of this}} loss of I(Ca) on function of the sensory neuron has not been defined. We therefore examined {{the extent to which}} altered membrane properties after nerve injury, especially increased excitability that may contribute to chronic pain, are attributable to diminished Ca 2 + entry. Intracellular microelectrode measurements were obtained from A-type neurons of dorsal root ganglia excised from uninjured rats. Recording conditions were varied to suppress or promote I(Ca) while biophysical variables and excitability were determined. Both lowered external bath Ca 2 + concentration and blockade of I(Ca) with bath cadmium diminished the duration and area of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP), accompanied by decreased current threshold for action potential (AP) initiation and increased repetitive firing during sustained depolarization. Reciprocally, elevated bath Ca 2 + increased the AHP and suppressed repetitive <b>firing.</b> <b>Voltage</b> sag during neuronal hyperpolarization, indicative of the cation-nonselective H-current, diminished with decreased bath Ca 2 +, cadmium application, or chelation of intracellular Ca 2 +. Additional recordings with selective blockers of I(Ca) subtypes showed that N-, P/Q, L-, and R-type currents each contribute to generation of the AHP and that blockade of any of these, and the T-type current, slows the AP upstroke, prolongs the AP duration, and (except for L-type current) decreases the current threshold for AP initiation. Taken together, our findings show that suppression of I(Ca) decreases the AHP, reduces the hyperpolarization-induced voltage sag, and increases excitability in sensory neurons, replicating changes that follow peripheral nerve trauma. This suggests that the loss of I(Ca) previously demonstrated in injured sensory neurons contributes to their dysfunction and hyperexcitability, and may lead to neuropathic pai...|$|E

Fixed ranges of substrate firing temperature (11001 – 13001 C), deposition voltage (50 – 300 V), and deposition time (1 – 5 min) were used as the in-dependent design variables to model responses of YSZ deposi-tion thickness, area-specific interfacial resistance (ASR), and power density.

Shunting inhibition scales subthreshold voltage, increasing the excitation frequency required to attain a particular firing rate. This reduces gain because frequency-dependent increases in input variability, which couple mean subthreshold <b>voltage</b> to <b>firing</b> rate, boost <b>voltage</b> fluctuations during inhibition.

40|$|A key {{question}} in neuroscience is at which level functional meaning emerges from biophysical phenomena. In most vertebrate systems, precise functions are assigned {{at the level}} of neural populations, while single-neurons are deemed unreliable and redundant.

Based on the hypothesis that neural circuits generate precise population codes under severe constraints on metabolic costs, we derive synaptic plasticity rules that allow a network to represent its time-varying inputs with maximal accuracy. We provide exact solutions to the learnt optimal states, and we predict the properties of an entire network from its input distribution and the cost of activity. Single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically observed in cortex emerge over the course of learning, but paradoxically coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code.

The NFPA ABU can be used upon approval by unit commanders by personnel requiring a fire-retardant fabric. The fabric is also NIR Compliant. There is another 100% cotton ABU version that is discontinued but available in limited quantities in both men's and women's sizes but this version is not fire retardant. Since the NFPA ABU's are 100% cotton, they are not nearly as durable, nor as [...] "wash and wear" [...] as the regular ABU's, but they are much cooler in extremely hot weather.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} antagonist, D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV), and other excitatory amino acid antagonists, were studied on CA 1 pyramidal neurones treated with picrotoxin or bicuculline to reduce synaptic inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Under these conditions epileptiform burst firing is readily produced by orthodromic stimulation of the pyramidal cell population. D-APV reduced the plateau amplitude and duration of the depolarization underlying evoked and spontaneous bursts without affecting membrane potential, input resistance or {{the ability of the}} cell to fire a Ca 2 + spike or a short train of Na+ spikes. A late component of the subthreshold excitatory post-synaptic potential (e. p. s. p.) was voltage dependent, being reduced in amplitude on membrane hyperpolarization. D-APV selectively removed this component of the e. p. s. p. in disinhibited slices. In contrast, in the absence of GABA antagonists, D-APV had no noticeable effect on the e. p. s. p. as studied with field potential recordings. The concentration-response relationship of the inhibitory effect of D-APV and L-APV on population spike bursts was studied. The action of APV was highly stereoselective; the EC 50 of D-APV was approximately 700 nM, whereas a similar inhibition required 540 microM-L-APV. A number of other excitatory amino acid antagonists were tested at a fixed concentration (100 microM). Among them, the quisqualate antagonist gamma-D-glutamylaminomethyl sulphonic acid was ineffective against epileptiform bursts. In the low nanomolar concentration range both D- and L-APV potentiated bursting. These results suggest that in the absence of GABAergic inhibition, a significant component of the slow depolarization underlying burst <b>firing</b> is <b>voltage</b> dependent, synaptic in origin and mediated by NMDA receptors. We propose that, under normal (non-epileptic) physiological conditions, the balance between synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA receptors and synaptic excitation mediated by NMDA receptors may modulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites...|$|R
