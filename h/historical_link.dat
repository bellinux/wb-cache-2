5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded Chortens are the Great Chorten and the Small Chorten (stupa) to {{the early}} 13th century, following {{the building of the}} Sumtseg. These chortens are decorated gateways known locally as 'Kakani Chörten' and 'Ka-ka-ni mchod-rten' that are considered unique to Alchi with <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> to other monuments. More chortens were added between the 13th and 14th centuries. In the Alchi complex, there are also three other chortens, which have ancient paintings.|$|E
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus also {{mentions}} that in 492 BC, some Thracian Brygoi or Brygians (Greek: Βρύγοι Θρήικες) fell upon the Persian camp by night, wounding Mardonius himself, though {{he went on}} with the campaign until he subdued them.

25|$|From 1972 onward, Clark became heavily {{involved}} {{in the use of}} newly developed scientific techniques for the analysis of archaeological material. Influenced by German and Scandinavian archaeological models, Clark drew on folklore and ethnography {{to gain a better understanding}} of prehistoric modes of subsistence. He nevertheless did not use such analogies uncritically, believing that they were mostly of use when there was a continuous <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> between older and more recent communities and where they both lived in very similar environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the inaugural}} 1988 season, the club's jersey design {{featured}} the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon {{and white and}} the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the maroon of the Queensland rugby league team. Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue {{was added to the}} jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{it became}} {{uneconomical}} to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped {{out and the}} salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected {{the town and the}} surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders that could be jacked up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> with the salt industry is celebrated in its museum, which is today located in the old workhouse.|$|E

25|$|Al-Arsuzi's central {{thought was}} the {{unification}} of the Arab Nation. He believed that the Arab Nation could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> to an Arab Nation {{was more important to}} al-Arsuzi than it was to other Arab nationalists and Ba'athists. The only way to create a new Arab Nation in the Modern Age was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language—the only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the Arab Nation) and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non–Arabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics—these laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.|$|E
500|$|The Rhondda Valley is {{most notable}} for its <b>historical</b> <b>link</b> to the coal mining {{industry}} {{which was at}} its peak between 1840 and 1925. The Rhondda Valleys were home to a strong early Nonconformist Christian movement which manifested itself in the Baptist chapels which moulded Rhondda values in the 19th and early 20th century. Rhondda is also famous for strong masculine cultural ties within a social community which expressed itself outside industry {{in the form of}} male voice choirs, sport and politics.|$|E
500|$|The {{new stadium}} took {{its name from}} the street which {{encloses}} the ground on three sides, the fourth boundary being the River Wensum. The name [...] "Carrow" [...] originally refers to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside, [...] its name in turn having possible Norse origins. In 1800, John Ridges, owner of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land opposite {{on the banks of the}} Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, [...] "granted permission for a proposed road access across his grounds to Carrow". [...] By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a surgeon, owned the building, lands and manor of Carrow, including the adjacent Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was created on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to provide work for the poor in the community. The road linked Martineau's [...] Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, installed in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had acquired the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of the future stadium belonged to the firm of J. & J. Colman. The stadium's Thorpe Corner acknowledges this <b>historical</b> <b>link.</b> In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and construction of the new stadium began swiftly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was purchased and ten days later, on 11 June, work began.|$|E
