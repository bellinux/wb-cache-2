5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in {{multistory}} apartment buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), toilets that were <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common {{people who lived in}} the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E

During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of holding}} a bicycle race around Italy was first {{suggested}} in a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of La Gazzetta dello Sport, to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando Cougnet. La Gazzettas rival, Corriere della Sera {{was planning to}} hold a bicycle race of its own, <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> the success of its automobile race. Morgagni decided to try and hold the race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, and following La Gazzettas success in creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea. The inaugural Giro d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in {{the first page of}} that day's edition of La Gazzetta, to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French magazine L'Autos organization of the Tour de France.|$|E

To check this, 66 Ghezel ewes were used in six groups (11 in each group) : Treatments consisted of group A as a control (basal diet), group B (<b>flushing</b> <b>with</b> barley grain), group C (<b>flushing</b> <b>with</b> barley grain+vitamin E+organic selenium), group D (<b>flushing</b> <b>with</b> barley grain+vitamin E+mineral selenium), group E (<b>flushing</b> <b>with</b> barley grain+monensin) and group F (<b>flushing</b> <b>with</b> barley grain+yeast). Ewes received experimental diets for 5 weeks (two weeks before and three weeks after mating). Magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium of serum were measured. The results showed that ewes in groups C and D had {{the lowest level of}} calcium and magnesium and highest level of sodium and potassium in the time of estrous and 21 days after mating (...|$|R

5|$|Walpole's {{taste for}} {{adventure}} did not diminish {{in his last}} years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst's newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was Tom Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which Walpole arrived <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII's election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book Roman Fountain, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

Burning and destroying everything in their path, they crossed the river. (There was no vessel with which to resist them, as all those of the Spanish fleet were in the provinces of the Pintados.) The Chinese rebels entered the parián (the Chinese quarter), and furiously assaulted the city gate, but were driven back by the arquebuses and muskets of the Spanish defenders, with the loss of many Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Freshwater mussels {{reproduce}} sexually. Sperm {{is released}} by the male directly {{into the water and}} enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a glochidium (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Reversed phase columns {{are quite}} {{difficult}} to damage compared with normal silica columns; however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and {{should never be}} used with aqueous bases as these will destroy the underlying silica particle. They {{can be used with}} aqueous acid, but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. RP-HPLC columns should be <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> clean solvent after use to remove residual acids or buffers, and stored in an appropriate composition of solvent. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a column is to inject a sample which is a mixture of 2,2'- and 4,4'- bipyridine. Because the 2,2'-bipy can chelate the metal, the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted (tailed) when metal ions are present {{on the surface of the}} silica...|$|E

25|$|The {{ecosystems}} of the Aral Sea and {{the river}} deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and {{the people living in}} the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. All of this has resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. The dust storms also contribute to water shortages through salt deposition, which has accelerated glacial melting to as much as 12 times the normal rate. The overuse of pesticides on crops to preserve yields has made this worse, with pesticide use far beyond health limits. Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land, and fields are being <b>flushed</b> <b>with</b> water at least four times per day to try to remove the salinity from the soils. The dust storms make regional winters colder, and summers hotter.|$|E
