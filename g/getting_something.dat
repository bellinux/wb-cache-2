How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since {{by definition}} it cannot {{be due to}} the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> from nothing.|$|E
25|$|In May 1940, the US {{requested}} base {{rights in}} Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> in return. In September 1940, {{as part of}} the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was {{for the duration of the}} war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).|$|E

500|$|Presley's divorce {{took effect}} on October 9, 1973. He was now {{becoming}} increasingly unwell. Twice {{during the year}} he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. Toward the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semicomatose {{from the effects of}} pethidine addiction. According to his primary care physician, Dr. George C. Nichopoulos, Presley [...] "felt that by getting [...] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> off the street." [...] Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever. Despite his failing health, in 1974 he undertook another intensive touring schedule.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{interpret}} the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. [...] Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship {{in such a}} manner that Jake knew [...] "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill." [...] Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, [...] "you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her." [...] By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the [...] "everyman," [...] and that {{in the course of the}} narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.|$|E

500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} {{and head of}} division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may {{think that they are}} <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> out of the performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?".

500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{completion}} of The Return of the King, Weta Workshop and Weta Digital, supervised by Taylor, Rivers, and Joe Lettieri, started pre-production on King Kong. Jackson brought back most of the crew he had on The Lord of the Rings series, including cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, production designer Grant Major, art directors Simon Bright and Dan Hennah, conceptual designer Alan Lee, and editor Jamie Selkirk. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens began to write a new script in late October 2003. Jackson acknowledged that he was highly unsatisfied with the original 1996 script. [...] "That was actually just Fran and Peter very hurriedly <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> down on paper", Boyens explained. [...] "It was more one of many possible ways the story could go." [...] The writers were adamant to base the new script on the 1933 film, rather than the 1996 script. They also included scenes that were either uncompleted or entirely omitted from James Ashmore Creelman's original script in the cutting room floor. In the scene where Kong shakes the surviving sailors pursuing Ann and himself from a log into the ravine, it was originally the intention of directors Merian Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack to feature giant spiders emerging from the rock to devour their bodies. This was cut from the original release print, and remains known to Kong fans only via a rare still that appeared in Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson included this scene and elaborated upon it. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens also cited Delos W. Lovelace's 1932 novelization of King Kong as inspiration, which included the character Lumpy (Andy Serkis). To make the relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong plausible, the writers studied hours of gorilla footage. Jackson also optioned Early Havoc, a memoir written by vaudeville performer June Havoc to help Walsh and Boyens flesh out Ann Darrow's characterization. Carl Denham was intentionally modeled after and inspired by Orson Welles. Their new draft was finished in February 2004.|$|E

2500|$|On {{arriving}} in Paris after the war, de Hory {{attempted to make}} an honest living as an artist, but soon discovered {{that he had an}} uncanny ability to copy the styles of noted painters. In 1946, he sold a pen and ink drawing to a British woman who mistook it for an original work by Picasso. His financial desperation trumped his scruples, as was most often the case for the next two decades. To his mind, it offered redemption from the starving artist scenario, buttressed by the comfortable rationalization that his buyers were <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> beautiful at [...] "friendly" [...] prices. He began to sell his Picasso pastiches to art galleries around Paris, claiming that he was a displaced Hungarian aristocrat and his offerings were what remained from his family's art collection, or that he had acquired them directly from the artist whom he had known during his years in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2016 ASEAN Summit, Duterte and U.S. President Barack Obama {{planned to}} meet with each other.

2500|$|In sports, {{competition}} tests who {{has better}} skill and ability {{at the time}} of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two chickens that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitates towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence [...] "the unity of society". Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of <b>getting</b> <b>something</b> so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting.
