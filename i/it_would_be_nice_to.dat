500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown {{at the end of the}} episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E

Flandez {{deemed the}} cover of [...] "Keep Holding On" [...] an [...] "emotionally satisfying showstopper", however was critical of Quinn's cover of [...] "You Keep Me Hangin On", which he called [...] "thin and jarring". Mitchell enjoyed the [...] "No Air" [...] duet, however felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see characters besides Finn and Rachel take the lead on the majority of songs. Reviewing musical performances in the series so far on October 21, 2009, Denise Martin for the Los Angeles Times rated [...] "Hate On Me" [...] the fourth best performance to date, writing that Riley: [...] "blew [...] away." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide also named the rendition one of Glee best performances, describing it as [...] "a real Beyoncé moment".

500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E
500|$|The actors' {{performances}} were praised by several critics. Carman thought McCormack and Messing worked [...] "nicely" [...] together, {{and called the}} supporting cast [...] "an asset". Kay Mcfadden of the Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". Robert Laurence of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote: [...] "Messing and McCormack play wonderfully together, tossing lines {{back and forth as}} if they'd been at it for years, making their relationship quite believable. Sean Hayes, as the flamboyantly gay Jack, adds to the mix. Jack is flighty, temperamental, good-humored and highly likable." [...] A reviewer for USA Today said he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Will have a [...] "full life of his own", and not just serve as a [...] "love-life adviser" [...] to Grace and Jack. [...] "I know it won't happen soon; NBC is so skittish about the so-called Ellen 'gay show' stigma, it's gone to Herculean lengths to avoid mentioning Will's sexuality.

500|$|On 1 December Sunderland beat Derby County 1–0. The defeat against Everton led to Craig Gordon {{being dropped}} from the side. He was {{replaced}} by Darren Ward who made a save to push Kenny Miller's strike onto the post. With the game looking to be heading towards a draw, Anthony Stokes scrambled to ball in to win the game. On 8 December Sunderland travelled to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea. Sunderland went behind in the 23rd minute through an Andriy Shevchenko goal. Chelsea won the game 2–0 after Liam Miller was sent off whilst giving a penalty away, which Frank Lampard scored. Sunderland played Aston Villa on 15 December, Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland ahead with a 10th-minute header. Villa midfielder Shaun Maloney equalised when he scored a from a 71st minute free kick. Sunderland could have won the game late on, but Danny Collins' header was ruled out by referee Steve Bennett for a foul. Roy Keane displayed his annoyance at Bennett saying [...] "It sums up (the referee's) day. He was giving everything against us and to say we're disappointed would be an unbelievable understatement. You could sense he was waiting to blow his whistle. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see him later." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me {{wondering if}} there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and I hope we get to hear more of it. [...] <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Megan get her answers, {{no matter what they}} may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} a {{mission in the}} Bahamas, Bond is in Nassau and attends a dinner party at Government House. When the other guests have left, Bond remarks that, if he ever marries, he imagines <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> marry an air hostess. The Governor then tells Bond {{the story of a}} relationship between a former civil servant Philip Masters and air hostess Rhoda Llewellyn. After meeting aboard a flight to London, the couple married and went to live in Bermuda; but, after a time, Rhoda began a long open affair with the eldest son of a rich Bermudian family. As a result, Masters' work deteriorated, and he suffered a nervous breakdown. After recovering, he was given a break from Bermuda by the Governor and sent on an assignment to Washington. Upon his return, Masters was determined to end his marriage; and he divided their home into two sections, half to each of them and refused {{to have anything to do}} with his wife in private—although they continued to appear as a couple in public. He eventually returned to the UK alone, leaving Rhoda with unpaid debts and stranded in Bermuda—a cruel act which he would have been incapable of carrying out just a few months earlier. The Governor explains his point to Bond: when the [...] "Quantum of Solace" [...] drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone and the relationship is finished. Despite the success of Masters' plan to take revenge on his unfaithful wife, he never recovered emotionally. After a time, Rhoda married a rich Canadian. The Governor then reveals that the dinner companions whom Bond found dull were in fact Rhoda and her rich Canadian husband.|$|E

500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> play something that requires {{a little bit more than}} just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E
500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith took {{inspiration}} for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 {{of the first}} series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. This episode took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. The writers were keen to explore other stories in this bottle episode or TV play format, and Inside No. 9 allowed them to do this. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying {{that the two of}} them had [...] "been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] Elsewhere, Shearsmith explained that the pair returned to writing macabre stories as they [...] "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [...] write something that's purely comedic, [...] it just feels too frivolous and light". The first story that the pair wrote specifically for Inside No. 9 was about a birthday party. BBC producers felt that this story would work as the opening episode of a sitcom, but, given the script's events, Pemberton and Shearsmith were not happy to develop the idea into its own programme. The script was consequently shelved and revisited during the planning process for the second series, becoming [...] "Nana's Party", the fifth episode of the series and eleventh overall. During the filming Inside No. 9, Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on the programme, saying that [...] "eing in the middle of filming a third series of Psychoville would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience with Inside No. 9 than they had experienced with Psychoville, describing [...] "Sardines", Inside No. 9s first episode, by saying that it was [...] "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "well put together", noting {{that it had}} [...] "ood set ups and good execution" [...] and that it [...] "gave us good comedy" [...] as it had [...] "plenty to work with." [...] In regards to the Liz and Dennis story, he admitted that while it was funny, it was [...] "fairly stereotypical." [...] Canning commented that Jack's relationship with Condoleezza Rice in the episode was a [...] "great concept" [...] and [...] "offered up {{a good number of}} chuckles", although [...] "it never became as clever as it appeared it was going to be." [...] Canning gave the episode a 6.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich was complimentary towards the episode, reporting, [...] "Now this is what I'm talking about. Second-tier cast integration, multiple stories going on, intimations that Condoleezza Rice likes phone sex... Another winning week for NBC's 30 Rock." [...] Mitovich enjoyed the fact that Jack was in a relationship with Rice, writing that another show [...] "would build [...] whole episode around them" [...] but that 30 Rock [...] "made it that much funnier by playing it in the background and thus getting to be more outrageous with it." [...] Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that Alec Baldwin [...] "always knocks the ball out of the park on the acting front" [...] but noted that [...] "the best material" [...] in this episode belonged to the Tracy and Toofer story. [...] "The show does have a tendency to telegraph its punchlines, but it was nice to have the two men's differences resolved by finding the funny in a Star Jones/excessive vomiting sketch." [...] Ward was complimentary towards Jane Krakowski, observing that her [...] "comic timing" [...] in [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "impeccable as usual, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see her character get a tad more three-dimensional." [...] Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on the show, citing that he does a [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis, while the Houston Chronicles Mike McDaniel opined that Winters had a [...] "cene-stealing and hilarious role" [...] on the show.|$|E

2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. [...] "But", someone says, [...] "we didn't know it would happen." [...] Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> clear {{away some of the}} moral fogs that surround our technologies.

[...] Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound stated that, [...] "Watching Movies is Miller's most enduring, and endearing, project yet. I won't be worried {{if he decides to}} overhaul his sound again someday – I trust his artistic acumen now – but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see him run with the aesthetic he found here."
