5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to <b>folic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that {{live within the}} human digestive system contribute to human health through gut immunity, the synthesis of vitamins such as <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and biotin, and the fermentation of complex indigestible carbohydrates.|$|E
5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid.</b> Another proposed {{explanation is that}} it is used to supply dietary fiber, helping the cat defecate more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{on the use}} of {{vitamins}} and minerals have not found enough consistent evidence to recommend them. This includes vitamin A, C, the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E, selenium, zinc, and <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> with or without vitamin B12. for the Prevention and Treatment of Healthy Elderly and Demented people | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | page = CD004514 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18843658 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004514.pub2 }} Evidence from a single study indicates that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E may slow cognitive decline. Trials examining <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements from plants and fish, and dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), do not appear to benefit people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{association}} between the blood levels of homocysteine and thrombosis, although {{this has not been}} reported consistently in all studies. Homocysteine levels are determined by mutations in the MTHFR and CBS genes, but also by levels of <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, which depend on diet.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and iron), occurring singly or in combination, {{and with}} or without any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> {{fortification}} {{regulation in}} 1996, the projected increase in <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake was 100nbsp&µg/d. Data {{from a study}} with 1480 subjects showed that <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake increased by 190µg/d and total folate intake increased by 323µg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/d. <b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake above the {{upper tolerable intake level}} (1000µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> supplements as well as <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> found in fortified grain products. Taken together, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> fortification has led to a bigger increase in <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake than first projected.|$|E
25|$|Folate {{deficiency}} can disrupt neuralation and neurogenesis. Maternal <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake {{around the}} time of conception prevents neural tube defects. Furthermore, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake was recently associated with incidence of autism. Enriched white flour is fortified with <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> in the United States and many other countries. However the European Union does not have mandatory <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> fortification. Although the protective effects of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeration. Furthermore, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{previous}} {{debate in the}} United Kingdom regarding the inclusion of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> in products such as bread and flour. While the Food Standards Agency has recommended <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> fortification, and wheat flour is fortified with iron, <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> fortification of wheat flour is allowed voluntarily rather than required.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the link between insufficient <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> and neural tube defects, governments and health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation for women intending to become pregnant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> used in {{fortified}} foods is {{a synthetic}} form called pteroylmonoglutamate. It {{is in its}} oxidized state and contains only one conjugated glutamate residue. <b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> therefore enters via a different carrier system from naturally occurring folate, and this may have different effects on folate binding proteins and its transporters. <b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> has a higher bioavailability than natural folates and are rapidly absorbed across the intestine; therefore, {{it is important to}} consider the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) when calculating one's intake. Natural occurring folate is equal to 1 DFE;, however, 0.6µg of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> is equal to 1 DFE.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortification}} {{program was}} estimated to raise a person’s <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake level by 70–130µg/day; however, an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed. This could be {{from the fact that}} many foods are over fortified by 160–175% the predicted value. In addition, much of the elder population take supplements that adds 400µg to their daily <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> intake. This is a concern because 70–80% of the population have detectable levels of unmetabolized <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> in their blood and high intakes can accelerate the growth of preneoplastic lesions. It is still unknown the amount of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation that might cause harm.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a lack of}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> a vitamin B, in {{the diet}} of a mother can cause {{cellular}} neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida. Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity (NTD) can be prevented by 72% if the mother consumes 4 milligrams of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy. <b>Folic</b> <b>acid,</b> or vitamin B9, aids {{the development of the}} foetal nervous system.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> {{fortification}} {{program in}} the United States has increased <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> content of commonly eaten foods such as cereals and grains, and as a result, diets of most adults now provide recommended amounts of folate equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate, which {{inhibits}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients on {{high dose}} {{sulfasalazine}} require folic supplementation (1mg/day) (1000µg/day) to maintain normal cell division. This may, however, be counter-productive {{for patients who}} are also taking methotrexate, which is a <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibitor. <b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> might also be counter-productive for patients taking 6-MP and related drugs that inhibit all cell division.|$|E
25|$|As of November 2013, no EU {{country has}} {{mandated}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> fortification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> {{supplements}} have {{no effect}} on the risk of developing prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{continues to}} investigate {{the extent to which}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> can reduce the incidence of clefting.|$|E
25|$|The pathway {{leading to}} the {{formation}} of tetrahydrofolate (FH4) begins when <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH2), which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. Thus, hydride molecules are transferred from NADPH to the C6 position of the pteridine ring to reduce <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> to THF.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the studies about the {{influence}} of dietary <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> on breast cancer have been contradictory.|$|E

25|$|Methotrexate {{is another}} {{immunosuppressive}} drug. It works by inhibiting <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> which {{is necessary for}} DNA replication and, therefore, cell division.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholics {{are often}} {{deficient}} in various nutrients, {{which can cause}} severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and <b>folic</b> <b>acid.</b> During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, <b>folic</b> <b>acid,</b> and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Folic</b> <b>acid</b> food {{fortification}} became mandatory in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150µg of <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> per 100grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains. The purpose of fortification was {{to decrease the}} risk of neural tube defects in newborns. It is important to fortify grains {{because it is a}} widely eaten food and the neural tube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even know they are pregnant.|$|E
