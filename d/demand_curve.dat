25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly elastic <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> equals minimum average cost. A MC firmâ€™s <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that circumstantial and empirical evidence for the existence of labour supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> is at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence. Because virtually all orthodox models of labour markets, simple and complex, are built upon the foundation stones of labour supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves,</b> these models lack empirically supported foundations. Orthodox labour economists must, therefore, either provide stronger evidence or stop using labour supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> as the foundation stones of their models. The conclusion discusses implications for future orthodox and heterodox labour economics...|$|R

25|$|When the income-consumption curve has a {{positive}} slope then the income elasticity of demand will be positive. The greater the shifts of the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> to the right, the greater the income-elasticity of demand. In such a case, the goods will be normal goods.|$|E

25|$|In two-sided networks, such pricing logic can be misguided. If firms {{account for}} the fact that {{adoption}} {{on one side of the}} network drives adoption on the other side, they can do better. <b>Demand</b> <b>curves</b> are not fixed: with positive cross-side network effects, <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> shift outward in response to growth in the user base on the network's other side.|$|R
25|$|The {{supply and}} demand {{economic}} model suggests that any tax raises the cost of transaction for someone, {{whether it is the}} seller or purchaser. In raising the cost, either the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> shifts leftward, or the supply curve shifts upward. The two are functionally equivalent. Consequently, the quantity of a good purchased decreases, and/or the price for which it is sold increases.|$|E
25|$|For all products, the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> has {{negative}} slope (slope, {{which is}} constant {{in case of}} a straight demand function, must not be confused with price elasticity of demand, which varies depending on the point of the curve on which it is calculated and is not therefore constant even along a straight demand curve; see the mathematical definition for more), and meets upwards sloping supply curve at a price point that defines the market for any given good or service at a particular moment in time.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a consumer good, the {{point on the}} <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer {{would be prepared to}} pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|Why do poor {{countries}} tax agriculture {{more than other}} sectors, whereas rich countries subsidize farmers? Using the neoclassical economic theory of the political market for Distortionary policies, an explanation is sought by examining changes to factors affecting the supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> in that political market. The aggregate effect of these changes is a shift in both the <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> and the supply curve to the right as industrialization proceeds. ...|$|R
2500|$|Since {{determinants}} {{of supply and}} demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> (often described as [...] "shifts" [...] in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and <b>demand</b> <b>curves.</b>|$|R

Of primary interest are the cross-price effects between unbundled loops purchased {{with and without}} unbundled switching. As expected, we find downward-sloping <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> for unbundled elements, with own-price elasticities in the elastic region of demand. Interestingly, however, we also find no evidence of positive cross-price elasticities between alternative modes of unbundled element entry...|$|R
25|$|The law {{of demand}} states that, in general, price and {{quantity}} demanded {{in a given}} market are inversely related. That is, the higher {{the price of a}} product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's idea {{of solving}} the {{controversy}} was that the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based on the consumer problem of maximizing utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly Long run and short run. This set of ideas gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard microeconomics texts, even though Marshall himself was highly skeptical {{it could be used}} as general model of all markets.|$|E
500|$|This {{method for}} {{computing}} the price elasticity {{is also known}} as the [...] "midpoints formula", because the average price and average quantity are the coordinates of the midpoint of the straight line between the two given points. This formula is an application of the midpoint method. However, because this formula implicitly assumes the section of the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> between those points is linear, the greater the curvature of the actual <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> is over that range, the worse this approximation of its elasticity will be.|$|E

In equilibrium the fee charged by active managers has to equal the before-fee alpha they earn; this endogenously determines the amount of active capital and the slopes of <b>demand</b> <b>curves.</b> A calibration of the model reveals that <b>demand</b> <b>curves</b> can indeed be steep enough to match the magnitude of many empirical findings, including the price effects for stocks added to (or deleted from) the S&P 500 index...|$|R
