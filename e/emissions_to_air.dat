Total identified mercury <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> soil and water in Poland for year 2010 from anthropogenic sources was estimated as 18. 0 Mg. Annual Hg <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> from by-product sources was equal 13. 5 Mg, with the highest share of emission from brown coal-fired power plants. Mercury contained in combustion residues and removed from flue gases is transferred to waste waters, disposed to landfills and used to a concrete production with unknown amounts. Annual mercury <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> {{from the use of}} mercury-containing products (0. 5 Mg) was estimated by authors based on model for distribution and emissions for batteries, light sources, other electrical and electronic equipment and also for measuring and control equipment. <b>Emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> from dental practice (0. 3 Mg) was estimated for combustion of wastes containing dental amalgam and from bodies cremation. SFA for the use of mercury-containing products and dental practice presents significant load of 10. 4 Mg mercury contained in hazardous wastes produced annually. It covers wastes of used products, dental amalgam wastes directly from clinics as well as stream from incineration of infectious dental wastes. In the paper mercury discharges to water from large and medium industrial facilities (2. 9 Mg) and municipal waste-water treatment plants in large agglomerations (0. 4 Mg) are presented. Smaller loads are generates by leachate transfer from municipal landfills to WWTPs and further to agriculture and also by releases from dental amalgam in buried bodies.
