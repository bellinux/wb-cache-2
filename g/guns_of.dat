5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> several {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> enemy battleships.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, the dispositions <b>of</b> the <b>guns</b> on the Western Front were: 1 <b>gun</b> <b>of</b> 92 Battery and 1 <b>gun</b> <b>of</b> 543 Battery with First Army i.e. Artois; 1 <b>gun</b> <b>of</b> 92 Battery with Third Army i.e. Somme; 1 <b>gun</b> <b>of</b> 543 Battery with Fourth Army i.e. Somme.|$|R
50|$|Total was 1 <b>of</b> 90 <b>guns,</b> 2 <b>of</b> 80 <b>guns,</b> 9 <b>of</b> 70 <b>guns,</b> 7 <b>of</b> 60 <b>guns,</b> 2 <b>of</b> 50 <b>guns,</b> 1 <b>of</b> 44 <b>guns.</b> The British fleet also {{comprised}} 6 smaller vessels - the fireships Garland (Samuel Atkins) and Griffin (Humphrey Orme), the storeship Success (Francis Knighton), {{the hospital}} ship Looe (Timothy Splaine), the bomb-ketch Basilisk (John Hubbard) and an unnamed bomb tender.|$|R

5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon {{would have had}} to have been designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to the breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm <b>guns,</b> <b>of</b> which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve {{seakeeping}} and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{designed}} by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the Regia Marina, based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire. In addition, the ship's superstructure and funnels were to be kept to a minimum.|$|E

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign, Burgess, now a major, {{commanded}} the 9th (Tasmanian) Battery. However, the <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> his battery were not landed until early May 1915. He {{and his men}} took over the <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> 7th Battery, allowing its personnel some rest. On 5 May, while reporting the location of Turkish artillery positions to his commander, Colonel Charles Rosenthal, he was wounded by shelling. His injuries required hospital treatment but {{he returned to the}} front on 17 May. Eventually poor health led to his evacuation from Gallipoli in October 1915. For his services during the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916 and given command of the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade, he served on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Finally, U.S. armored {{divisions}} {{under the}} March 1942 organization possessed 68 37mm anti-tank <b>guns.</b> <b>Of</b> these, 37 {{belonged to the}} armored infantry regiment (four in each company and one in regiment HQ); 27 to the armored engineer battalion; three to the divisional train and one to division HQ.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire.

5|$|After safely landing {{the first}} half of the division, the 12th Cruiser Squadron {{returned}} to Bizerta to collect the remaining troops, consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade, the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the Glider Pilot Regiment. The only casualties in the landing occurred on 10September when HMS Abdiel, while manoeuvring alongside the dock, struck a mine and sank. Casualties totaled 58 killed and 154 wounded from the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, and 48 dead among Abdiel's crew. Abdiel was also carrying twelve 6pounder anti-tank <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Anti-tank Battery, and the division's reserve ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|Although the PanzerI would {{participate}} {{in almost every}} major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> the PanzerI.|$|E
