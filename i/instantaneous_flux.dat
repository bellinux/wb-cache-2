The decrease in volume of the liquid A and increase in volume of the gas B over time can be ignored for the purposes of solving the equations that describe the behaviour, and an assumption can be made that the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>flux</b> at any time is the steady state value. There are no radial or circumferential components to the concentration gradients, resulting from convection or turbulence caused by excessively vigorous flow at the upper mouth of the tube, and the diffusion can thus be treated as a simple one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction. The mole fraction of A at the upper mouth of the tube is zero, {{as a consequence of the}} gas flow. At the interface between A and B the flux of B is zero (because it is insoluble in A) and the mole fraction is the equilibrium value.|$|E

We then extend the analysis to provide analytic expressions for the momentum flux integrals in both the energy-resolved, and the energy+angular-momentum-resolved microcanonical ensembles. These latter expressions allow substantial gains in the efficiency of microcanonical variational implementations of Transition State Theory with generalized reaction coordinates.

40|$|Abstract-Magnetic core pulse {{transformers}} {{operating in}} a repetitive mode must maintain the core flux density within the saturation bounds of the magnetic material to provide satisfactory performance. The <b>instantaneous</b> <b>flux</b> is established by the time integration of the induced winding voltage. Alternatively, the flux is also determined by the net instantaneous magneto-motive force acting on the core {{in relation to the}} core dimensions and material hysteresis characteristics. Core material is typically non-linear and is awkward to model, so the preferred method of flux determination is via the induced voltage integration method. During the output pulse duration, this induced voltage is forced on the core via the winding by the pulsed power source and establishes the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>flux</b> and flux time derivative during the pulse. In the steady state, the integration of the induced voltage that occurs between load pulses, commonly called the back-swing period, must equal the value established by the output or load portion of the pulse to avoid saturation.

The transmembrane pressure (TMP) obtained after 24 h of filtration was dominated by the fouling rates calculated within the first hour of the experiment.

An analysis of the three different fouling layers provided a unique insight into the composition (protein and carbohydrate) and spatial distribution of the particulate and soluble foulants. The upper fouling fraction consists of a porous, loosely bound cake layer with a similar composition to the biomass flocs. The intermediate fraction, which consists of equal parts of soluble molecular products (SMP) and biomass aggregates, features a higher concentration of carbohydrates and possibly plays a significant in the formation of consecutive cake layer.

Typically, the time discretization of most models is flexible and can range from minutes to months. However, the implications of variable time discretization for predicted soil C turnover are seldom discussed. In this study, we demonstrated that averaging of input temperature data will lead to changes in predicted C turnover in terms of daily amplitude and the impact of extreme temperatures.

During the investigation, river discharge was controlled to increase sharply and then decrease gently. The measurement {{data were analyzed}} with composition method. The results show that exchange flow varied significantly over the spring–neap cycle, being weakest during middle tides and strongest during neap tides. It could be concluded that sub-tidal vertical shear dispersion, resulting from the estuarine exchange flow, is the dominant mechanism driving the salt flux since the salt flux resulting from vertical shear dispersion varies in amplitude by over an order of magnitude, which is close to two times {{as large as the}} variation of advective salt flux. Intorduction It is every difficult to measure the tidally averaged salt fluxes because the amplitude of the fluctuating component of the <b>instantaneous</b> salt <b>flux,</b> due primarily to tidal advection of the mean along-channel salinity gradient, can exceed the tidally averaged salt flux by an order of magnitude or more.

Strong nonlinear responses to environmental variability characterize WLES, and the resulting complexity of system dynamics has challenged research focussed on general understanding and site specific predictions. To address this challenge our synthesis brings together current views of complexity from ecological and hydrological sciences to look towards a framework for understanding ecohydrological systems (in particular WLES) as complex adaptive systems (CAS). This synthesis suggests that WLES have many properties similar to CAS. In addition to exhibiting feedbacks, thresholds, and hysteresis, the functioning of WLES is strongly affected by self-organization of both vertical and horizontal structure across multiple scales. As a CAS, key variables for understanding WLES dynamics are related to their potential for adaptation, resistance to variability, and resilience to state changes. Several essential components of CAS, including potential for adaptation and rapid changes between states, pose challenges for modelling and generating predictions of WLES. Model evaluation and predictable quantities may need to focus more directly on temporal or spatial variance in contrast to mean state values for success at understanding system-level characteristics.
