40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out in one {{irrigation}} scheme of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study assessed the economic performance of a smallholder irrigation scheme (Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme). The study took place in a former homeland area (Ciskei). This region is submitted to a semi-arid and relatively mild climate. The infrastructures were built during the apartheid era, in order to provide employment and food to the local black population. Currently, the farmers crop from 1 to 10 hectares, producing vegetables and maize with low productivity. The government has engaged in a revitalization process, aimed at upgrading infrastructures and establishing new local organisations. Its objectives are to curtail the financial burden of operation and maintenance costs and withdraw from any direct farming activities and management of the schemes. The process includes the rehabilitation of infrastructure and establishment of Water User’s Associations, which are to take over ownership and collective management of the scheme. In such context the aims of the research were: (i) To evaluate the diversity of livelihoods and the contribution of farming; (ii) To estimate productivity of land and water; (iii) To identify factors influencing production at farm level; (iv) To examine the role of land tenure onto productivity. The conceptual framework for operation of an irrigation scheme, the Smile (sustainable management of irrigated land and environment) approach, the sustainable livelihood framework and descriptive statistics were used for analysis of the data. Primary data were obtained from 55 randomly selected households from the Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme. Verbal description, interpretation and appreciation of facts were used for the qualitative data analysis. Descriptive statistics and typologies were employed to analyse the quantitative data. Findings indicate that irrigation households pursue heterogeneous livelihood strategies due to different access to livelihood assets and heterogeneous constraints and incentives. A socioeconomic comparison on the land size indicates that land size in the scheme is not uniform, it varies from one person to another. Land tenure in Zanyokwe is very diverse. It is highlighted that land tenure {{does not seem to have}} impact onto the farming style adopted by farmers, with the exception of leasing which is not practised by non-farming holders and dry-land farmers. It is demonstrated that there is no direct or clear relationship between land tenure system and farming styles, farmer’s types, or cropping systems adopted. It is indicated that farmers under leasing arrangement are having small size, few years of settlement and youngest household <b>head.</b> <b>Leasing</b> arrangement is relatively new tenure in the scheme. The level of education in the scheme is very low. It is observed that more educated farmers have larger size of land in the scheme. The diversity of the farmer’s situation has been highlighted through the use of typological techniques. Five household types have been identified within the scheme, and thorough economic analyses have been carried out. Particularly, some vulnerable types of farmers have been identified. The results on irrigation performance indicate that productivity of water varies among crop management styles. For example, potato and butternut (high-yield) showed R 2. 55 and R 1. 75 as gross margin per cubic meter used respectively, and potato and butternut (low yield) showed R 0. 09 and R 0. 14 as gross margin per cubic meter used respectively, is measured in terms of gross margin per volume of irrigation water consumed as an estimate for return to irrigation water. Contingent analysis of willingness to pay indicated that farmers with limited demand, hence limited income from irrigation farming are not willing to pay, and it also suggests that farmers with high consumption of water are willing to pay for water related activities. Findings indicate that land productivity (yield/ha) is higher for specialised subsistence farmers than others types, per unit of land used The following recommendation arises on the basis of the findings of this study and evidence from other studies on smallholder irrigation in South Africa. Agriculture is likely to be a necessary feature of rural development in the Eastern Cape Province for years to come. It is highly recommended that intensification should be promoted along with training, and improved access to inputs at reasonable cost since high yielding crops are more profitable and more conducive to water valuation, and high yields come with intensification, since one given crop can perform very differently depending on the way it is grown.

40|$|Written by Whitlam, {{passed by}} Fraser, the Northern Territory Land Rights Act is falling victim to ill-considered amendments, writes Sean Brennan THERE are {{telltale}} signs when ideology overrides common sense in making new laws. Government tries to ram changes through quickly, {{under the radar}} of public and media scrutiny. The process looks dodgy and words in the law mean {{the opposite of what}} they say. Even long-term allies and kindred spirits cannot conceal their discomfort and unease. That is precisely what is going on this week with proposed amendments to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. This is Australia’s high water mark in land rights legislation. Whitlam introduced it in 1975 and Fraser ensured it went through the following year. For a long time it enjoyed bipartisan support and both sides of politics are rightly proud of what the law has achieved, including the return of half the Territory to traditional ownership. The Howard government wants to make some of the most dramatic changes to that law in its thirty year life. Some of the amendments reflect the public policy process at its best. Some show a government using parliament like a doormat. It is ignoring advice on all sides to slow down and bring people on board over issues that everyone can agree on. The Bill proposes a range of reforms. Many result from extended consultation and negotiation. As a result, changes to streamline agreement-making about mining on Aboriginal land enjoy broad support. They show that land councils and miners are just as interested as governments in facilitating appropriate economic development for Aboriginal people on their land. Sadly other parts of the package have not been approached in the same spirit. The proposal to grant <b>head</b> <b>leases</b> over Aboriginal townships to government entities for 99 years is about improved housing and economic development, according to the Minister Mal Brough. These are objectives no one disagrees with. So it is unfortunate that the Commonwealth has reverted to a “government knows best” attitude, something that has failed in indigenous affairs almost every time it has been tried. Instead of adopting the partnership approach it took to mining changes, the government has simply bolted the leasing proposals onto the Bill. Brough says leasing is voluntary, but no one is buying that and indications to the contrary are already coming in from the Top End. Flaws in the process show up in the content of the law. The terms of the leasing deal are stacked against traditional owners, in favour of the government. On the floor of parliament Brough had to ditch his initial plan for an arbitrary limit on the rent Aboriginal people could charge. But other restrictions on the ability of traditional owners to a get a fair deal remain. Why tie the hands of traditional owners in lease negotiations if the whole objective is to promote an enterprise culture? Meanwhile, last-minute changes of major proportions are still being made. The Northern Territory government, which is central to whole plan, had only three days to comment on the legislation. Like all cases of policy on the run you have to wonder what the rush is really about. The Bill also makes it possible for the Commonwealth minister to break up existing land councils into smaller, less powerful organisations. Again these are unilateral measures and reflect long-standing ideological views about the strength of existing Aboriginal organisations. They run counter to the Commonwealth’s drive elsewhere for consolidation and economies of scale in native title and Aboriginal legal services. That mismatch was pointed out by the Minerals Council of Australia. When the miners side with land councils against the government, it is a sure sign that government ideology about indigenous affairs is trumping workability and genuine stakeholder interest. When the government goes further and adopts the doublespeak of “delegation” to describe the stripping of core functions from land councils by the minister, it becomes even clearer that the Senate must not pass this law in its current form. The government used the guillotine procedure to cut off debate in the lower house, after less than three hours. A Senate committee had a one day hearing and a few days to write a report. Government senators said the process was “totally inadequate” and “such fundamentally important legislation should have bipartisan support with broad consensus among stakeholders affected”. At present half the Bill has that and the other half is nowhere near that point. The Bill is before the Senate. Either it should be split so that the consensus provisions can pass or the entire law should be deferred, so that more sensible proposals for achieving its objectives can be agreed upon by all stakeholders. • Sean Brennan is a project director at the Gilbert +Tobin Centre of Public Law at UNSW Law School. He has worked in the past for land councils, including in the Northern Territory. This article was first published on theage. com. au. Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|R
