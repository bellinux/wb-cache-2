40|$|AbstractAdaptability of {{inspection}} and testing activities in manufacturing systems is of high importance for sustaining quality of products and production processes. However, process models identifying the demand for changing quality testing activities as well as methodologies for systematic adaption of ongoing quality inspection processes are deficient. This {{is related to the}} fact that existing <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> procedures are primarily related to product and process development stages and not to ongoing series production. Furthermore, knowledge acquired by modifying ongoing quality inspection activities is seldom used systematically to improve <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> for future product and process development. This paper presents a holistic approach for <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> covering the systematic change and adaption process {{of inspection}} activities during manufacturing stage as well as knowledge transfer to future product and process development.

A quick collision detection algorithm is given, which is based on the STL representation. Force response is analyzed to distinguish between an occurred collision and a normal contacting of the tip to an inspection point. Using STL representation, the virtual CMM probe unit model is more precise, which results in the accessibility analysis implemented precisely.

This improvement in efficiency allows a greater range of designs to be assessed and the design space to be searched more effectively.

Designs with good typical performance are identified through utility maximisation.

Due to strict legal {{requirements}} {{to ensure the}} functionality of high-risk medical devices, both manufacturing costs and quality costs contribute significantly to total production costs. Thus, quality costs {{have to be taken}} into consideration during the stage of technology planning. Due to the high variety of potential interactions between individual component properties as well as between component properties and manufacturing processes, the analysis of the influence of the manufacturing history on an efficient design of inspection processes is extremely complex. Furthermore, the effects of test strategies and quality costs on the planning of manufacturing process sequences can not be modeled to date. As a consequence, manufacturing and testing processes are designed separately and thus a high cost reduction potential remains untapped. In this paper an approach for an integrative technology and <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> is presented. At first, existing approaches with regard to technology and <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> are reviewed. Afterwards, a model to depict the manufacturing history including alternative inspection pro-cesses will be introduced.

40|$|Abstract: A basic {{assumption}} {{often made}} in risk- and reliability-based <b>inspection</b> <b>planning</b> {{is that a}} Bayesian approach can be used. This implies that probabilities of failure can be updated in a consistent way when new information (from inspections and repairs) becomes available. The Bayesian approach and a no-crack detection assumption imply that the inspection time inter-vals usually become longer and longer with time. For ageing platforms several small cracks {{should be expected to}} be observed according to the bath-tub curve development often assumed – implying an increased risk for crack initiation (and coalescence of small cracks) and increased crack growth. This should imply shorter inspection time intervals for ageing structures. Different approaches for updating <b>inspection</b> <b>plans</b> for older installations are proposed. The most promis-ing method consists of increasing the rate of crack initiations {{at the end of the}} expected lifetime – corresponding to a bath-tub hazard rate effect.
