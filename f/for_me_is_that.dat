500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says {{at the end and}} yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is where I want to be. [...] The best thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacGill {{is noted}} for his fondness for wine, holding {{a degree in}} viticulture, and books, once reading 17 novels during a tour of Pakistan. Known for his individuality, {{he was the only}} Australian cricketer to declare himself {{unavailable}} to tour Zimbabwe in 2004 on moral grounds. He also refused to appear in an advertisement for Cricket Australia sponsor KFC, saying: [...] "The problem <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> KFC and Cricket Australia are hitting parents where they’re vulnerable. Parents are already {{under a lot of pressure}} from kids to buy this stuff and when you get the Australian cricket team endorsing it you just increase that pressure. It’s just wrong in so many ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} a great time to bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Kim Medcalf for her great work playing Sam Mitchell for three years and welcome Danniella back to pick up the baton once again." [...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago. All Ricky ever gets off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E

[...] Additionally, University of California scientists and other independent experts recommend containment measures in urban areas, but that full-scale airplane spraying should be saved for crop areas that agricultural departments are trying to protect in the Central Valley. [...] Oakland city council member Jane Brunner questioned the location of the sprayings in interviews and in her resolution against the efforts, stating, [...] "A very curious issue <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they're spraying in Richmond, Berkeley and Oakland, but they are not spraying in Danville, Walnut Creek and out in the valley." [...] In April 2008, Oakland City Attorney John Russo, in an article expressing his reasons for opposing the spray, said that state officials cannot describe the amount of the chemical it will take to rid the state of apple moths, nor how many years the spray will need to be conducted. [...] He also mentioned: ...|$|E

The problem <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> should not allow the creation of a second minority problem in the area of western Greek Macedonia first minority being the Turkish-speaking Greeks of western Thrace. My main aim was to convince the Republic to declare <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no Slavomacedonian minority in Greece. This was the real key of our difference with Skopje.|$|R

At 13 Talmy appeared regularly on the popular NBC-TV television show Quiz Kids, a question-and-answer program out of Chicago.

40|$|I {{began my}} journey as {{librarian}} for my church sometime {{at the end}} of 2004. I truly enjoyed the library experience at my previous church and wanted my new church home to offer a wide variety of great materials for our congregation. The good news <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we already had a room and materials that served as our church library. The bad news <b>was</b> <b>that</b> most of the materials were really outdated and only a very few people were using the library. So, I took a step back and devised a strategy for bringing our library back to life...|$|R

It was all just dreadful stuff, but you stumble along, and you learn.

5000|$|In {{his first}} notable case, Cochran {{represented}} an African-American widow who sued several {{police officers who}} had shot and killed her husband, Leonard Deadwyler. Though Cochran lost the case, it became {{a turning point in}} his career. Rather than seeing the case as a defeat, Cochran realized the trial itself had awakened the black community. In reference to the loss, Cochran wrote in The American Lawyer, [...] "those were extremely difficult cases to win in those days. But what Deadwyler confirmed <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this issue of police abuse really galvanized the minority community. It taught me that these cases could really get attention." ...|$|R

6000|$|They all {{spoke of}} Hawthorne, {{and with the}} same affection, but {{the same sense of}} {{something}} mystical and remote in him; and every word was priceless to me. But these masters of the craft I was 'prentice to probably could not have said anything that I should not have found wise and well, and I am sure now I should have been the loser if the talk had shunned any of the phases of human nature which it touched. It is best to find that all men are of the same make, and that there are certain universal things which interest them as much as the supernal things, and amuse them even more. There was a saying of Lowell's which he was fond of repeating at the menace of any form of the transcendental, and he liked to warn himself and others with his homely, [...] "Remember the dinner-bell." [...] What I recall of the whole effect of a time so happy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in all that was said, however high, however fine, we were never out of hearing of the dinner-bell; and perhaps this is the best effect I can leave with the reader. It was the first dinner served in courses that I had sat down to, and I felt that this service gave it a romantic importance which the older fashion of the West still wanted. Even at Governor Chase's table in Columbus the Governor carved; I knew of the dinner 'a la Russe', as it was then called, only from books; and it was a sort of literary flavor that I tasted in the successive dishes. When it came to the black coffee, and then to the 'petits verres' of cognac, with lumps of sugar set fire to atop, it was something that so far transcended my home-kept experience that it began to seem altogether visionary.|$|E
