500|$|Znaniecki {{coined the}} term [...] "humanistic coefficient" [...] for a method of social {{research}} by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> objectively described. He argued {{that the difference between}} the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.|$|E

By March 19, the Tonga Electric Power Board had restored electricity to several consumers including major government buildings and the Nuku'alofa Business District. However, several consumers were expected to be without electric until at least June 1997.
