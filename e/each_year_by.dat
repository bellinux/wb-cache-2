5|$|Annual world {{production}} of yttrium oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of yttrium oxide were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, {{there were}} only about 600 mares and 50 stallions left in the breed. Increasing {{mechanization}} and competition with other livestock hurt the Poitevin, as did a lack of promotion and protection. Between 1970 and 1990, {{the population of the}} Poitevin varied between 250 and 300 animals, with an average of 20 new horses entering the studbook <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> <b>By</b> the early 1990s, population numbers fell to the lowest in history. Sources are unclear on the number of living Poitevins in the early 1990s, but by 1996 one author says there were 64 newly registered foals and 28 approved breeding stallions, while another gives a total population of 293 horses in 1997.|$|E

The council itself consists of 11 councillors elected for a four-year term and from these a mayor and deputy mayor are elected <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> the council.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate {{that has taken place}} since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> the Icelandic Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|Packer {{estimates}} {{more than}} 200 Tanzanians are killed <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, {{and that the}} numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters {{not just because of}} ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.|$|E

The two participating teams in that year's World Series were previously represented by two press pins {{set on the}} base of the trophy. It is the only championship trophy of the four major sports in North America that is not named after a particular person (contrasting with the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup, the National Football League's Vince Lombardi Trophy, and the National Basketball Association's Larry O'Brien Trophy).|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{has been}} used in falconry for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605) of the Mughal Empire. There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail in Tunisia and Georgia, where there are 500 registered bazieri (sparrowhawkers) and a monument to bazieri in the city of Poti. Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland. At Cap Bon in Tunisia, and in Turkey, thousands are captured <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> falconers and used for hunting migrant common quails. Although they were formerly released {{at the end of the}} season, many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants.|$|E
5|$|World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by {{attendees}} and judges {{at the annual}} World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which {{has the power to}} break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue {{in the form of a}} bust of H.P.Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; future ceremonies will present a different, unannounced statuette.|$|E

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— {{in most cases}} by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E
