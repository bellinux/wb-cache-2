5|$|In December 1595, Kepler was {{introduced}} to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. Müller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also {{the daughter of a}} successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials—who had <b>helped</b> <b>set</b> up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.|$|E

5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort <b>helped</b> <b>set</b> up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game <b>helped</b> <b>set</b> Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, <b>helped</b> <b>set</b> her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{inability}} to take a wicket in the WNCL, Ebsary was retained in the national team {{and in the next}} five months of international cricket, she did not bowl a ball. Ahead of the 2009 World Cup, the Australians headed to New Zealand for a Rose Bowl series, Ebsary was left out of the first two ODIs against New Zealand, but was recalled for the next two matches at Seddon Park in Hamilton. She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top-score of 86 the next day. Batting at No. 3, she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls, scoring at faster than a run-a-ball. This <b>helped</b> <b>set</b> up Australia's 4/307 and they went on to win by 44 runs, their second consecutive victory. The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground. She did not bat or bowl in a rain-affected Australian win.|$|E

When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered.
