5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or <b>introductory</b> <b>course,</b> sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E

25|$|Many modern Karaite Jews {{have emerged}} from the Karaite revival of the late 20th century; the World Karaite Movement was founded by Nehemia Gordon and Ḥakham Meir Rekhavi in the early 1990s. Karaite Jewish University (KJU), {{approved}} by the Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim (the Council of Sages) in Israel, was founded to teach an <b>introductory</b> <b>course</b> on Karaite Judaism.

Thus, newly admitted converts to Karaite Judaism can choose to accept or reject Sevel HaYerushah.|$|E
25|$|A {{compulsory}} <b>introductory</b> <b>course</b> to Swedish for all {{pupils in}} primary education {{was introduced in}} the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (peruskoulu, grundskola) was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in secondary and tertiary education. Administrative services have, {{since the end of the}} 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with the Western world through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was still a part of the Nordic countries, and not an Eastern Bloc country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.|$|E

Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his students {{to a greater extent than}} those which he was then lecturing on, and so undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot {{described}} StarCraft as [...] "The defining game of its genre. It is {{the standard}} by which all real-time strategy games are judged." [...] IGN stated that StarCraft [...] "is hands {{down one of the}} best, if not the best, real-time strategy games ever created." [...] StarCraft is frequently included in the industry's best games rankings, for example it ranked 37 in Edges top 100 games of all time. StarCraft has even been taken into space, as Daniel Barry took a copy of the game with him on the Space Shuttle mission STS-96 in 1999. StarCrafts popularity resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the game four world records, including [...] "Best Selling PC Strategy Game," [...] "Largest Income in Professional Gaming," [...] and [...] "Largest Audience for a Game Competition" [...] when 120,000 fans turned out to watch the final of the SKY proleague season 2005 in Busan, South Korea. Researchers have shown that the audience for watching StarCraft games is diverse and that StarCraft uses instances of information asymmetry to make the game more entertaining for spectators. In addition, StarCraft {{has been the subject of}} an academic course; the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-run <b>introductory</b> <b>course</b> on theory and strategy in spring 2009.|$|E
