25|$|Global brain theorists {{reply that}} the {{emergence}} of distributed intelligence {{would lead to the}} <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> this vision. The reason is that effective collective intelligence requires diversity of opinion, decentralization and individual independence, as demonstrated by James Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

25|$|In the 1820s, Eugene Onegin is a bored Saint Petersburg dandy, {{whose life}} {{consists}} of balls, concerts, parties and nothing more. One day he inherits a landed estate from his uncle. When {{he moves to}} the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic and the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech {{is often referred to as}} Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.|$|E

25|$|There are oxygen sensors in {{the smaller}} bronchi and bronchioles. In {{response}} to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexly cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict. (This is the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O2 cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting {{in a much more}} even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in middle of the lungs that the blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.|$|E

500|$|With a $15 million budget, {{production}} {{began on}} February 23, 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia. Zombie acknowledged that filming in Georgia provided certain {{tax breaks for}} the company, but the real reason he chose that location was because the other locations {{he was planning to}} use were still experiencing snowy weather.

500|$|Kamal Haasan's character, Arun, is {{an early}} version of a {{metrosexual}} male [...] sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, is the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Arun [...] money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: [...] "Women should be enjoyed, not analysed." [...] According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life— he too smokes and drinks, but applies vibhuti (sacred ash) on his forehead. This implies that Thyagu was also an atheist. According to film critic Naman Ramachandran, Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu [...] "a prejudiced ass", Thyagu responds by saying, [...] "I am a male ass," [...] with the dialogue being in English.

In [...] "Two odes of Keats's" [...] (1897), William C Wilkinson suggested that [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is deeply flawed because it contains too many [...] "incoherent musings" [...] that failed to supply a standard of logic that would allow the reader to understand the relationship between the poet and the bird.
