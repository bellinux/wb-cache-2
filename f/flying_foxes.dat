5|$|St Kilda's {{adventure}} playground covers 4 hectares {{along the}} seafront {{and is one}} of South Australia's best known. The playground has a constructed shipwreck, wooden castle, huge slides, a spiral slide inside a hill, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and numerous other pieces of play equipment, with South Australian children naming it in 2002 as the best adventure park in the state.|$|E
5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> {{are exposed}} to several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a megabat {{native to}} Australia. The species shares {{mainland}} Australia {{with three other}} members of the genus Pteropus: the little red <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. scapulatus), the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. conspicillatus), and the black <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. alecto).|$|R
50|$|The small <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> island <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> or {{variable}} <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus hypomelanus) is {{a species of}} <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It is found in Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|The large <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. vampyrus) is {{generally}} reported {{as the largest}} Pteropus, but a few other species may match it, {{at least in some}} measurements. The large <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> has a wingspan up to 1.5 m and five individuals weighed 0.65 - 1.1 kg. Even greater weights, up to 1.6 kg and 1.45 kg, have been reported for the Indian <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. giganteus) and great <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. neohibernicus), respectively. The black-bearded <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. melanopogon) is massive and may be heavier than all other megabats, but exact weight data are not available. Comparably, no full wingspan measurements are available for the great <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. neohibernicus), but with a forearm length up to 206 mm, it may even surpass the large <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. vampyrus) where the forearm is up to 200 mm. Outside this genus, the giant golden-crowned <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Acerodon jubatus) is the only bat with similar dimensions.|$|R
5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this {{is associated with a}} steep drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E
5|$|Baby <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> {{usually come}} into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the second}} largest order of mammals (after the rodents), {{representing}} about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders: the less specialized and largely fruit-eating megabats, including <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> and the highly specialized and echolocating microbats. About 70% of bat species are insectivores. Most of the rest are frugivores, or fruit eaters. A few species feed from animals other than insects, with the vampire bats being hematophagous, or feeding on blood.|$|E
50|$|The insular <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> or Pacific <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus tonganus) is {{a species}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It is {{geographically}} widespread, the most widespread <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the Pacific: it is found in American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa (where it is called pe'a fanua, pe'a fai and taulaga), the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.|$|R
50|$|The black-bearded <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus melanopogon) is an {{endangered}} species of megabat in the Pteropus genus. It is endemic to Indonesia, found on the islands of Ambon, Buru, Seram, Banda, and Yamdena. Currently considered monotypic, it formerly included the Aru <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> and Kei <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> as subspecies. No weight data are available for the black-bearded <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> {{but it is a}} massive species and it may be the heaviest megabat.|$|R
50|$|The Vanikoro <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{is a small}} <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{that has}} an average body length was {{indicated}} by surveyors as about {{half the size of}} a Pacific <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> with large heads and small ears. Coloration includes a dark brown pelage with dark brown-black skin.|$|R
5|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>foxes</b> {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. <b>Flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Movements of grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{terrestrial}} mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), cats (Felis catus), {{and brown}} rats (Rattus norvegicus), are fairly {{common in the}} stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> {{were found in the}} stomach of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.|$|E
50|$|The dusky <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus brunneus), {{also known}} as the Percy Island <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> is an extinct species of <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It was endemic to Percy Island off the {{southeast}} coast of Mackay, Queensland, in the northeast corner of Australia.|$|R
50|$|The masked <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> Moluccan masked <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> or masked {{fruit bat}} (Pteropus personatus), is {{a species of}} <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to Indonesia. It {{is part of a}} species complex of closely related species. The species is hunted.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> least <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> or least {{fruit bat}} (Pteropus woodfordi) is {{a species of}} <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands. It is {{threatened}} by deforestation, which is believed to damage roosting sites in old growth forests.|$|R
5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set to go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and <b>Flying</b> <b>Foxes</b> were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but {{it takes}} birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including <b>flying</b> <b>foxes)</b> as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus. It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up {{to the size of a}} swan. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{is similar}} to the Siamese algae eater (Crossocheilus oblongus) and the false <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Garra cambodgiensis) when young.|$|R

50|$|The Samoa <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> or Samoan <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus samoensis) is {{a species}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> in the family Pteropodidae. It is found in American Samoa, Fiji, and Samoa (where it is known as pe'a and pe'a vao). Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Their winter colonies {{can have}} as many as 100 individuals. Bonin <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> do not have a strong fear of humans.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the northernmost}} species of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> It is endemic to the Bonin Islands of Japan, {{including}} Chichijima and Hahajima; and the Iwo Islands, including North Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and South Iwo Jima.|$|E

50|$|The Mauritian <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus niger), {{also known}} as Greater Mascarene <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> or Mauritius fruit bat is a large megabat species endemic to Mauritius and La Réunion.|$|R
25|$|The large <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus vampyrus), {{also known}} as the greater <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> Malayan <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> Malaysian <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> large fruit bat, kalang or kalong, is a {{southeast}} Asian species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. Like {{the other members of the}} genus Pteropus, or the Old World fruit bats, it feeds exclusively on fruits, nectar and flowers (despite its scientific name). It is noted for being one of the largest bats. As with nearly all other Old World fruit bats, it lacks the ability to echolocate but compensates for it with well-developed eyesight.|$|R
