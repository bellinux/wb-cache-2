The two tool stowage boxes on the fenders were removed. The swim vanes were {{modified}} by reducing the number of vanes from seven to four and the fender profile was raised nearer to the horizontal. The fume <b>extraction</b> <b>ports</b> on the hull roof to the rear of the turret were moved outwards and reoriented to point toward the rear of the vehicle. The single torsion bar used to spring the rear roof troop hatches was replaced by a twin torsion bar system. The firing ports on the side were moved up into the armor plate, giving the weapons used in the ports a higher degree of elevation. The vehicle weighs 12.6 tonnes. It was built from 1966 to 1969. It is sometimes incorrectly known as the BMP-A by some Western sources. NATO gave it the designation BMP Model 1966.|$|R

50|$|Since shotgun shells {{are nearly}} twice as wide as 7.62×39mm cartridge, the <b>extraction</b> <b>port</b> {{in the side of}} the dust cover had to be {{increased}} in size. However, since the bolt had to remain the same length to fit inside the AK-47 sized receiver, the rear section of the bolt is covered by a sliding metal flap that rides on the recoil spring. This allows the gun to be sealed against dirt when the bolt is forward, but the compression of the recoil spring during firing moves the flap rearward to clear the extracted shells.|$|E

40|$|Beam {{to the new}} Isotope Separation and ACcelerator (ISAC) Facility at TRIUMF will be {{extracted}} from <b>extraction</b> <b>port</b> 2 A of the cyclotron. Whereas other beam lines at TRIUMF require achromaticity at target locations for both beam size and experimental requirements, this extraction line need not be achromatic provided that a nominal beam diameter of 5 mm is attainable at the target locations. This paper presents a proposed beam line configuration that meets these requirements. Beam spill calculations with the program REVMOC show that no beam loss occurs beyond the cyclotron and the combination magnet. 1 AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT An ISAC facility for TRIUMF was first proposed in 1984 at the Mount Gabriel Workshop[1] and the Parksville Workshop[2] in 1985 defined the basic accelerator parameters.

Given {{the lack of}} navigable river systems, which had facilitated that economic development of the United States, the innovation of railroad construction overcame significant topographical obstacles. Where large networks were constructed, they aided domestic economic integration as well as linking production zones to ports and borders for regional or international trade. In some cases, railway lines directly linked zones of production or <b>extraction</b> to <b>ports</b> without linkages to larger internal networks. An example is line built from the nitrate zone in northern Chile, seized during the War of the Pacific, to the coast.

Dustiness is relevant wherever powders are mixed, transferred or handled, and {{is important in}} the control of hazardous exposures and the prevention of dust explosions and product loss. Limited quantities of active pharmaceutical powders available for testing led to the development (at University of North Carolina) of a Venturi-driven dustiness tester.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the anatomy, literature, and our own {{experiences}} {{in an effort to}} assist in the decision-making process of choosing between an umbilical or vaginal port. Umbilical access is more familiar to general surgeons; it is thicker than the transvaginal entry, and has more nerve endings and sensory innervations. This combination increases tissue damage and pain in the umbilical port site. The vaginal route requires prophylactic antibiotics, a Foley catheter, and a period of postoperative sexual abstinence. Removal of large specimens is a challenge in traditional laparoscopy. Recently, there has been increased interest in going beyond traditional laparoscopy by using the navel in single-incision and port-reduction techniques. The benefits for removal of surgical specimens by colpotomy are not new. There is increasing interest in techniques that use vaginotomy in multifunctional ways, as described under the names of culdolaparoscopy, minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Both the navel and the transvaginal accesses are safe and convenient to use in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons. The umbilical site has been successfully used in laparoscopy as an entry and <b>extraction</b> <b>port.</b> Vaginal entry and extraction is associated with a lower risk of incisional hernias, less postoperative pain, and excellent cosmetic results.

40|$|Introduction Measuring {{the beam}} profile on a medical cyclo-tron {{in real time}} can aid in {{improved}} tuning of the cyclotron and give important information for a smooth operation. Typically the beam profile is measured by an autoradiography technique or even by a scintillator that can be viewed in real time [1, 2]. Another method is to use collimators {{in front of the}} target to assess the beam center-ing [3]. All these methods have potential draw-backs including; an inability to monitor the beam in real time for the radiograph, exhibiting a non-linear correlation in signal response to the power deposited for a scintillator, and not providing a 2 -dimensional profile of the complete beam for collimators. Our goal was to design a realtime, linear, 2 -dimensional beam-profile monitor that is able to withstand the high power of a PET cyclotron. Material and Methods The beam-profile monitor (PM) is designed for the TR 13, a 13 MeV negative hydrogen-ion cyclotron at TRIUMF. The design follows the concept of a ‘harp’ monitor, widely used at TRIUMF for tuning proton and radioactive ion beams, and is installed on the <b>extraction</b> <b>port</b> without separation from the tank vacuum. The TR 13 monitor is designed to withstand a 13 MeV proton beam with a beam current of up to 25 µA, has an active area of 10 by 10 mm and does not affect the 10 - 7 torr tank vacuum. The device consists of a water-cooled Faraday cup made out of aluminium for low activation and two orthogonal rows of eight tungsten electrodes each mounted on a water-cooled support frame. Electrodes are spaced 1 mm apart from each other, see FIG. 1. The electrodes are electrically isolated from each other and each has a current pickup soldered to it. The material and the shape of the electrodes are optimized to withstand the deposited power of the proton beam. A voltage of - 90 V is applied to the electrodes to repel secondary electrons and prevent crosstalk between neighbouring electrodes. The electrode current is amplified using a custom current amplifier, and read by an ADC. From there, the current data is displayed on a PC. This allows one to observe changes of the beam profile in real time. The electronics are designed to read out all sixteen channels in parallel, or, if {{only a limited number of}} ADC channels are available, to cycle through the different channels. In our current setup all sixteen channels are read out simultaneously. Results and Conclusion The beam-profile monitor provides a real-time representation of the proton beam, see FIG. 2. The data can also be recorded and analyzed at a later time. The linearity of the monitor has been measured up to 30 µA of proton beam current [4]. With the use of the monitor, it was possible to increase the output of the ion source into the target by 50 % in comparison to the standard tune...|$|E

40|$|The Celtic Sea marine {{ecosystem}} {{is an area}} of diverse wildlife and important ecological activity. It {{is also one of the}} most heavily used bodies of water in the world of with multiple sectors including industry, shipping, commercial fishing and coastal recreation competing for space and resources. Like oceans and seas globally, this region is experiencing pressures due to increasing human activity. In response to this growing problem, the European Commission LIFE+ programme funded a project called Partnerships Involving Stakeholders in the Celtic Sea Eco-System (PISCES). The primary aims of PISCES are to: find new and innovative ways to engage stakeholders in working together on environmentally sound solutions for the region; develop stakeholder understanding of the ecosystem-based approach to marine management; and, produce a set of stakeholder-led guidelines for an ecosystem-based approach to management of activities in the area.   Current EU-wide marine management policies rely on effective application of an ecosystem-based approach (e. g., the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive; the Common Fisheries Policy). PISCES is a pioneering project in that it is translating EU maritime policy into practical outputs for multiple sectors and across a multinational area encompassing four countries: the UK, Ireland, France and Spain. This three-year project, which began at the end of 2009, identifies the key players in the Celtic Sea representing all major human uses and impacts, and builds successful stakeholder partnerships through a series of workshops whilst also facilitating additional interactions in order to maximise the out-reach and impact of the practical guidelines. Stakeholders include the fishing and aquaculture industries, marine renewable energy companies, shipping, oil, gas and aggregate <b>extraction</b> industries, <b>ports,</b> environmental agencies, coastal tourism and recreation industries, as well as key policy makers from the four countries...|$|R
40|$|Aim: We {{compare the}} outcome of three {{different}} methods of graft extraction after a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Materials and Methods: After a conventional five port laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, specimen was extracted through one of three approaches: 1. Iliac fossa (IF) incision and hand extraction, 2. Midline (MD) periumbilical with a lower polar fat stitch incorporating gonadal vein for traction while retrieval, and 3. Pfannensteil (PF) with Gel <b>port</b> <b>extraction.</b> Estimated blood loss, operating time, warm ischemia time, incision length, pain score, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, wound complications, graft complications and recipient creatinine at 6 weeks were analyzed. Results: Warm ischemia time was significantly reduced in PF group {{when compared to other}} groups. Length of the incision was less in the MD group compared to other groups. Wound complications were significantly less in PF group when compared to other groups. Graft extraction complications were significantly high in MD group compared to other two groups. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained, our current method of preference is by Pfannensteil incision. A controlled extraction {{with the use of a}} hand assist device would be best for donor safety and to avoid graft related complications...|$|R
