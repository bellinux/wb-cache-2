25|$|Later {{that same}} day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as Singing on the River, where they perform madrigals and {{arrangements}} of popular songs from {{a raft of}} punts lit with lanterns or fairy lights on the river. For the finale, John Wilbye's madrigal Draw on, sweet night, the raft is unmoored and punted downstream to give a <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>effect.</b> As a tradition, however, this latter concert dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this, an annual concert on the river was given by the University Madrigal Society.|$|R
50|$|This {{is why it}} is so {{difficult}} to explain how quick the passage is between what is visible for the eye and the mind and what is not, as is revealed by the notorious <b>fade</b> in-fade <b>out</b> <b>effect</b> used in the movies when one picture succeeds another: as one picture gradually vanishes, the following one gets clearer and clearer. And the same goes for music when one theme succeeds another.|$|R
50|$|The first 11 {{tracks on}} Disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition are each longer than their {{correspondent}} {{on the standard}} version, some more significant than others.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} ECEC on child development and children’s later life outcomes. Using meta-analytical techniques, we synthesize the findings from a recent strand of literature, exploiting natural experiments to identify the causal effects of universal ECEC arrangements (IV; DID; RDD). We use 253 estimates from 30 studies conducted between 2005 and 2015. Our meta-regressions include estimates {{on a wide variety}} of children’s outcomes, ranging from (non-) cognitive development measured during early childhood to educational outcomes during adolescence and labor market performance during adulthood. We classify these diverse outcomes by whether the effect of ECEC on children’s outcomes is significantly negative, statistically insignificant or significantly positive and estimate our main meta-analytical models regressions with ordered probit models. Our findings indicate that the evidence on universal ECEC is mixed. Whether the impact is positive or negative cannot be explained by the age of enrollment nor the intensity of the program. Quality, however, matters critically. Furthermore, there is no evidence of <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> and the <b>effects</b> of ECEC appear to be more favorable in the long run (during adolescence/adulthood). The study shows that the gains of ECEC are concentrated within the group of disadvantaged children...|$|R

5000|$|STTD {{is one of}} {{numerous}} open loop transmit diversity schemes which also include Phase Switched Transmit Diversity (PSTD), Time Switched Diversity (TSTD), Orthogonal Transmit Diversity (OTD) and Space Time Spreading (STS) 1. The aim {{of all of these}} schemes is to smooth the Rayleigh <b>fading</b> and drop <b>out</b> <b>effects</b> observed when using only a single antenna at both ends of a radio link in a Multipath propagation environment. Diversity improves link reliability for each user over time, especially near cell edges (in the absence of soft handoff), and also the average performance of an ensemble of users at any particular instant. Not being reliant on slow channel-state feedback from the mobile (i.e. user equipment) means that open loop STTD is almost immune to Doppler shifts associated with high UE speeds and is the preferred method for this scenario. However, an open loop transmit diversity scheme must not degrade performance for a user close to the base station where the channels may be line of sight and nearly ideal. Since STTD is an orthogonal coding system this is also guaranteed.|$|R

50|$|Both the {{original}} and radio edit of the song was often played over the airwaves during the late 1970s. The difference is the song <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> before the second saxophone solo and ending guitar melody that would itself eventually <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> with primary instruments being removed.|$|R
5000|$|Of note, 1960s record {{releases}} {{of the second}} version, as well as subsequent hits packages of the song, feature a <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending. The cold ending version (heard in one episode of the television series) was first released on Arista's [...] "Then And Now, The Best Of The Monkees" [...] in 1986. Subsequent hits packages and reissues of the single on their Flashback label also feature the longer version. Early examples of the Flashback single release have the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending.

40|$|About 30 % {{of people}} on Earth have latent toxoplasmosis. Infected {{subjects}} do not express any clinical symptoms, however, they carry dormant stages of parasite Toxoplasma {{for the rest of}} their life. This form of toxoplasmosis is mostly considered harmless, however, recent studies showed its specific effects on physiology, behaviour and its associations with various diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Individuals who suffer from schizophrenia have about 2. 7 times higher prevalence of Toxoplasma-seropositivity than controls, which suggests that some traits characteristic of schizophrenic patients, including the sex difference in schizophrenia onset, decrease of grey matter density in specific brain areas and modification of prepulse inhibition of startle reaction could in fact be caused by toxoplasmosis for those patients who are Toxoplasma-seropositive. We measured the effect of prepulse inhibition/facilitation of the startle reaction on reaction times. The students, 170 women and 66 men, were asked to react as quickly as possible to a startling acoustic signal by pressing a computer mouse button. Some of the startling signals were without the prepulse, some were 20 msec. preceded by a short (20 msec.) prepulse signal of lower intensity. Toxoplasma-seropositive subjects had longer reaction times than the controls. Acoustic prepulse shorted the reaction times in all subjects. This effect of prepulse on reaction times was stronger in male subjects and increased with the duration of infection, suggesting that it represented a cumulative effect of latent toxoplasmosis, rather than a <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> after <b>effect</b> of past acute toxoplasmosis. Different sensitivity of Toxoplasma-seropositive and Toxoplasma-seronegative subjects on effect of prepulses on reaction times (the toxoplasmosis-prepulse interaction) suggested, but of course did not prove, that the alternations of prepulse inhibition of startle reaction observed in schizophrenia patients probably joined the list of schizophrenia symptoms that are in fact caused by latent toxoplasmosis...|$|R

5000|$|Another aspect in {{the film}} are the <b>fade</b> <b>outs,</b> which are {{traditionally}} used in movies to represent time passing or to conclude a certain scene, instead bring the viewers {{back to the point}} in time which the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> began. The occasional <b>fade</b> <b>outs</b> and <b>fade</b> ins to Julie's character are used to represent an extremely subjective point of view. According to Kieślowski: [...] "at a certain moment, time really does pass for Julie while at the same time, it stands still. Not only does her music come back to haunt her at a certain point, but time stands still for a moment." ...|$|R
