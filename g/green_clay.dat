5|$|Shelby's {{confidence}} in the federal government's war planning was shaken by the disastrous Battle of Frenchtown in which a number of Kentucky soldiers died. He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so. In March 1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at Fort Meigs. Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest son James, under General <b>Green</b> <b>Clay.</b> The reinforcements arrived to find Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians. Clay's force was able to stop the siege, but {{a large number of}} them were captured and massacred by Indians. Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner exchange.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, <b>Green</b> <b>Clay</b> pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{served in}} the Virginia House of Delegates and as a presidential elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and <b>Green</b> <b>Clay.</b> A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} deposits that {{we analyzed}} from Leg 70 {{are composed of}} ferruginous <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> and fragments of manganese-hydroxide crust. Data from X-ray diffraction, IR-spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and chemical analyses indicate that the hydrothermal <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> are composed of disordered mixed-layer phases of celadonite-nontronite. Electron diffraction shows that {{the parameters of the}} unit cells and the degree of three-dimensional ordering of mixed-layer phases with 80 % celadonite interlayers are very close to Fe-micas of polymorphic modification IM-celadonite. In some sections, there is a tendency for the number of celadonite layers to increase with depth. The manganese-hydroxide crust fragments are predominantly composed of todorokite (buserite). An essential feature of hydrothermal accumulation is the sharp separation of Fe and Mn. Ba/Ti and Ba/Sr ratios are typical indicators of hydrothermal deposits. Sediments composing the hydrothermal mounds were deposited from moderately heated waters, which had extracted the components from solid basalts in environments where there were considerable gradients of temperature, eH, and pH. The main masses of Fe and Mn were deposited in the late Pleistocene. Postsedimentary alteration of deposited hydrothermal sediments led to their slight recrystallization and, in the <b>green</b> <b>clays,</b> to celadonitization. Further, factor analysis (by Varentsov) of chemical components from these hydrothermal deposits revealed paragenetic assemblages. <b>Green</b> <b>clays</b> corresponding to a definite factor assemblage were formed during the main stage of hydrothermal mineral formation. Manganese hydroxide and associated components were largely accumulated during an early stage {{and at the end of}} the main stage...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of physical properties, including wet-bulk density, water content (porosity), sonic velocity, thermal conductivity, and shear strength {{were made for}} sediments from the Galapagos mounds area cored by the hydraulic piston corer. Sediments in this area include manganese oxides, granular <b>green</b> <b>clays,</b> nongranular <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> (intermediate be-tween granular <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> and pelagic sediments), and pelagic sediments. Average values of physical properties appear in Table 1. The difference in sonic velocity and density between hydrothermal materials and pelagic sediments may be respon-sible for the complex seismic reflection pattern at mound sites. However, the depth variation of acoustic impedance in holes which are not at mound sites is smooth, {{and there are no}} obvious contrasts to account for regional seismic reflec-tors at 7 and 15 meters depth. The depth gradients of porosity and therefore of density (and thermal conductivity) of pelagic sediments in the mounds area are very large and correlate well with surface heat flow. This suggests that the high depth gradients may be attributed to the effect of hydrothermal circulation and that hydrothermal convection cells may be essentially fixed with the moving plate. Based on the porosity-depth relation found in this area, the hydraulic impedance of sediment layers is calculated as a function of their thickness, using the porosity-permeability relation of Bryant et al. (1974). The hydraulic impedance of the sediment layer increases with thickness and at several tens of meters thickness it becomes comparable to that of the basement rock layer, if the basement layer is 2 ~ 3 km thick and has an average permeability of 2 ~ 30 millidarcy...|$|R

500|$|Although he did {{not believe}} Garrard had {{personally}} done anything wrong, Logan formally protested the outcome of the election to Kentucky Attorney General John Breckinridge. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the state senate, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the [...] "peace and welfare" [...] of the state. State senator <b>Green</b> <b>Clay</b> was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning. By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him.|$|E
500|$|The {{largest group}} of delegates at the {{convention}} [...] about 18 in number [...] were aristocrats who advocated protection of their wealth and status, including instituting voice voting in the legislature (which left legislators vulnerable to intimidation), safeguarding legal slavery, and limiting {{the power of the}} electorate. A smaller group led by <b>Green</b> <b>Clay</b> and Robert Johnson consisted mostly of planters who opposed most limits on the power of the legislature, which they believed was superior to the executive and judicial branches. A third group, led by future governor John Adair, agreed with the notion of legislative supremacy, but opposed limits on other branches of the government. The smallest group was the most populist and was led by John Bailey. The conservative faction strengthened the previous constitution's slavery protections by denying suffrage to free blacks and mulattoes. Legislative apportionment based on population, the addition of a lieutenant governor, and voice voting of the legislature [...] all issues advocated by Breckinridge [...] were also adopted. He was unable to preserve the electoral college that elected the governor and state senators, but the direct election of these officers was balanced by a provision that county sheriffs and judges be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Attempts to make judicial decisions subject to legislative approval were defeated after Breckinridge defended the extant judicial system. He was also the architect of the constitution's provisions for amendment, which made changing the document difficult, but not entirely impossible. Because of his leading role in the convention, Breckinridge was regarded as the father of the resultant constitution, which was ratified in 1799, and emerged from the convention as the leader of his party. He was reelected as Speaker of the House in 1800.|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} mounds on {{the southern}} flank of the Galapagos Spreading Center are characterized by the following main features: 1) They are located over a young basement (0. 5 to 0. 85 m. y. of age) in a region known for its high sedimentation rate (about 5 cm/ 10 ** 3 y.) because {{it is part of}} the equatorial high biological productivity zone. 2) They are located in a region with generally high heat flow (8 to 10 HFU). The highest heat-flow measurements (up to 10 ** 3 HFU) correspond to mound peaks (Williams et al., 1979), where temperatures up to 15 °C were measured during a dive of the submersible Alvin (Corliss et al., 1978). 3) They are often located on small vertical faults which displace the basement by a few meters (Lonsdale, 1977) and affect the 25 - to 50 -meter-thick sediment cover. Most of these characteristics have also been observed in the other three known cases of hydrothermal deposits with mineral parageneses similar to that of the Galapagos mounds. However, the case of the hydrothermal mounds south of the Galapagos Spreading Center is unique because of the unusual thickness of the hydrothermal deposits present. The mounds are composed of several, up to 4. 5 -meter-thick, layers of <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> which, in one case (Hole 509 B), are overlain by about 1. 4 meters of Mn-oxide crust. We suspect that such a large accumulation of hydrothermal products results from the "funnelling" of the hydrothermal solutions exiting from a highly permeable basement along the faults. This chapter reports a preliminary study of those <b>green</b> <b>clays</b> collected by hydraulic piston coring of the Galapagos mounds during Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 70 of the D/V Glomar Challenger. <b>Green</b> <b>clays</b> have also been reported from three presently or recently active hydrothermal areas in or close to spreading centers...|$|R
