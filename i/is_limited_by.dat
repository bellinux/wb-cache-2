40|$|Abstract In total hip arthroplasty, {{determining}} the impingement free {{range of motion}} requirement is a complex task. This is because in the native hip, motion is restricted by both impingement as well as soft tissue restraint. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine a range of motion bench-mark which can identify motions which are at risk from impingement and those which are constrained due to soft tissue. Two experimental methodologies were used to determine motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> impingement and those motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> both impingement and soft tissue restraint. By comparing these two experimental results, motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> impingement <b>were</b> able to be separated from those motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> soft tissue restraint. The results show motions in exten-sion as well as flexion combined with adduction <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> soft tissue restraint. Motions in flexion, flexion combined with abduction and adduction are at risk from osseous impingement. Consequently, these motions represent where the maximum likely damage will occur in femoroacetabular impingement or at most risk of prosthetic impingement in total hip arthroplasty...|$|R

5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} {{analysis}} {{are used in}} the bioprospecting of metagenomic data: function-driven screening for an expressed trait, and sequence-driven screening for DNA sequences of interest. Function-driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity, followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis. This approach <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell. Moreover, the low rate of discovery (less than one per 1,000 clones screened) and its labor-intensive nature further limit this approach. In contrast, sequence-driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest. In comparison to cloning-based approaches, using a sequence-only approach further reduces the amount of bench work required. The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated, which require high-throughput bioinformatic analysis pipelines. The sequence-driven approach to screening <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the breadth and accuracy of gene functions present in public sequence databases. In practice, experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence-based approaches based upon the function of interest, the complexity of the sample to be screened, and other factors.|$|E
