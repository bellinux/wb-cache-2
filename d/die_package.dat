The objectives of this study to investigate the warpage issues for QFN package with different die sizes. It was found that the balance between the bending at the edge size region and the die attach region controls the package warpage. The warpage was attributed to a large mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).

40|$|International audienceThermal {{management}} {{is becoming a}} major concern in microelectronics because of transistor technology reduction and power density increases within complex packages. Temperature rise due to power dissipation worsens harmful clock skew, jeopardizes reliability and leads to over-consumption because of leakage current dependence on temperature. To limit these risks, electronics engineers have to perform thermal simulations {{at an early stage}} of the design flow and for several granularity levels (<b>die,</b> <b>package,</b> PCB, [...] .). To speed up and ease the thermal characterization process, the engineers need small, accurate and easy-togenerate thermal models, which can be reused at every integration step. Several macro-modeling techniques exist (DELPHI, HotSpot, [...] .), but they cannot satisfy all the points mentioned above. This paper presents a new methodology called Flex-CTM for Flexible Compact Thermal Modeling to build and to interface compact thermal models at different granularity levels. Each part of an electronic system is prepared to be plugged into any other environment and reduced to save memory and time, resulting a thermal micro-model. Therefore, a fast-to-simulate macro-model of a full system can be obtained by assembling the micro-models. The Flex-CTM is found to have number of advantages over both current resistive models (junction-tocase and junction-to-board) and Dynamic Compact Thermal Models. The first advantage of coupling models together allows multi-source and dynamic simulations at any design level. The second is the control on the accuracy. The third advantage is the Boundary Condition Independence property to allow architecture exploration. Finally and the most important, micro and macro-models are shared by teams to be reused and completed...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{improvements}} in the VLSI domain have enabled the integration of billions of transistors on the same die operating at frequencies in the gigahertz range. These advancements have brought upon the era of system-on-chip (SoC). Traditionally, analog ICs has been prone to device noise while digital ICs have typically not been the prime concern being considered as relatively immune to noise. With faster transition times and denser integration, the scenario wherein digital ICs {{were considered to be}} immune to noise has changed significantly. Drastic changes in the physical design of an IC and increase in the operating frequencies has immensely changed the classical understanding of noise in the new age complex ICs. Switching noise specifically has become a dominating criteria for high performance digital and mixed signal ICs. Voltage variations on the power/ground nodes of a circuit is a type of switching noise affecting digital and mixed-signal ICs. Therefore, power integrity (PI) has become a critical challenge that must be addressed at the system level considering the parasitic effects of package and board. In this work, a <b>die,</b> <b>package</b> and board modeling and co-simulation methodology is presented which can be easily integrated into a standard VLSI design flow.

Suitable die attached condition and DAF material selection had been evaluated to achieve required reliability performance in the manufacturing of the 3 D Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) stacked <b>die</b> <b>package.</b> Approach: During this study, special attention {{was given to the}} development of the residual stresses due to mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion of different DAF materials. Both experimental and finite element method were employed to gain a better understanding in a stress development induced between two different type of DAF, different die attach temperature and during the manufacturing process. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the changes of heat flow characteristics for both types of DAF. The die bond strength results measured using shear testing machine were compared with the finite element method prediction. Results: Although both DAF samples achieved good reliability performance and passed the Moisture Sensitivity Level 3 test (MSL 3) at reflow 260 °C without any sign of delamination, numerical simulation had demonstrated that the stress development were increased exponentially as the die attach temperature increased. It showed that different DAF gave different values of stresses but presented the same trend which the lowest die attached temperature (100 °C in comparison with 125 °C and 150 °C) gave more stress to the die and possibility that the die will have weak adhesion to the substrate was high. Conclusions/Recommendations: Therefore for this case, stress can be relieved by having higher die attached temperature with an adequate bonding force and time, however die attached temperature for both DAF must be used above the glass transition temperature (128 °C for DAF A and 165 °C for DAF B) and being controlled not to exceed the crystallization temperature (203 °C for DAF A and 204 °C for DAF B) of both DAF...|$|E
40|$|This unique push-pull/parallel circuit {{produces}} a power output of four devices without the added loss {{and cost of}} power splitters and combiners. Motorola MRF 150 RF power FET {{makes it possible to}} parallel two or more devices at relatively high power levels. This technique is considered impractical for bipolar transistors due to their low input impedance. In a common-source amplifier configuration, a power FET has approximately five to ten times higher input impedance than a comparable bipolar transistor in a common emitter circuit. The output impedance in both cases is determined by the dc supply voltage and power level. The limit to the number of FETs that can be paralleled is dictated by physical, rather than electrical restrictions, where the mutual inductance between the drains is the most critical aspect, limiting the upper frequency range of operation. The magnitude of these losses is relative to the impedance levels involved, and becomes more serious at lower supply voltages and higher power levels. Since the minimum mounting distance of the transistors is limited by the package size, the only real improvement would be a multiple <b>die</b> <b>package.</b> For higher frequency circuits, these mutual inductances {{could be used as a}} part of the matching network, but it would seriously limit the bandwidth of the amplifier. This technique is popular with many VHF bipolar designs. In paralleling power FETs another important aspect must be considered: If the unity gain frequency (fα) of the device is sufficiently high, an oscillator will be created, where the paralleling inductances together with the gate and drain capacitances will form resonant circuits. The feedback is obtained through the drain to gate capacitance (Crss), which will result in 360 ° phase shift usually somewhere higher than the amplifier bandwidth. Thus, the oscillations may not be directly noticed in the amplifier output, but may have high amplitudes at the drains. This can be cured by isolating the paralleling inductance, which consists of the dc blocking capacitors (C 7 – C 10, Figure 2) and their wiring inductance from the gates. Low value noninductive resistors which do not appreciably affect the system gain can be used for this purpose...|$|E
