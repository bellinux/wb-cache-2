2500|$|Besides {{many of the}} pasta, {{sausage and}} dessert dishes common to {{continental}} Europe, churrasco is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Chilean asado) which originated in southern Brazil. It contains a variety of meats which may be cooked on a purpose-built [...] "churrasqueira", a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. Portable [...] "churrasqueiras" [...] {{are similar to those}} used to prepare the Argentine, Chilean, Paraguayan and Uruguayan asado, with a <b>grill</b> <b>support,</b> but many Brazilian [...] "churrasqueiras" [...] do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the State of Rio Grande do Sul).|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of choices for the decking {{material}} as it is required to be both tough and non-slip in a range of operating conditions. Most manufacturers use some form of open <b>grill</b> sheeting <b>supported</b> on a rugged base structure.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Perry opened Rockpool Bar & Grill in Melbourne. Less formal than Rockpool, the {{restaurant}} is an upmarket steakhouse, located in Crown Casino. High quality beef cooked over wood-fire <b>grill,</b> <b>supported</b> by a modern and international à la carte menu form {{the backbone of the}} food served. In spite of the riskiness of opening a large restaurant (serving up to 200 people a day) in a venue as high profile and lucrative as Crown Casino, {{the restaurant}} has proved a major success for Perry. Rockpool Bar & Grill Melbourne has also received positive reviews from critics since opening, including being awarded two coveted [...] "chefs hats" [...] in the Melbourne Good Food Guide.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 and 2003 the {{building}} from surveyed for its physical integrity {{and the degree}} of damage it had suffered. It was found that the conservation status of {{the building}} had been affected by the spread of Serpula lacrymans (dry rot), causing serious deterioration to the roof {{and other parts of the}} wooden structure; almost the whole building is affected. Subsequently, the previously closed windows were fitted with <b>grills,</b> <b>supporting</b> the ceilings, which were in danger of collapsing, and new coverings were installed over the roof. Because no buyer had been found for the listed building, Deutsche Bahn submitted an application for its demolition to the Federal Railway Authority (EBA) in Hanover in the summer of 2005. Deutsche Bahn undertook to build a modern station after the planned demolition, sufficient for current purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} inexpensive of charcoal grills, the brazier grill {{is made of}} wire and sheet metal and composed of a cooking grid placed over a charcoal pan. Usually the <b>grill</b> is <b>supported</b> by legs attached to the charcoal pan. The brazier grill {{does not have a}} lid or venting system. Heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grid up or down over the charcoal pan. Even after George Stephen invented the kettle grill in the early 1950s, the brazier grill remained a dominant charcoal grill type for a number of years. Brazier grills are available at most discount department stores during the summer.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. We introduce real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) for continuous cell mechanical characterization of large populations (> 100, 000 cells) with analysis rates greater than 100 cells/s. RT-DC is sensitive to cytoskeletal alterations and can distinguish cell-cycle phases, track stem cell differentiation into distinct lineages and identify cell populations in whole blood by their mechanical fingerprints. This technique adds a new marker-free dimension to flow cytometry with diverse applications in biology, biotechnology and medicine. We thank A. Taubenberger, M. Herbig, C. Liebers, L. Menschner, C.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to analyze the thermodynamics (thermal conductivity and diffusivity as well as protein denaturation) and physical properties (percent expressible moisture, cooking loss, change in steak thickness, shear force, texture profile analysis and rheological behavior) of beef steaks of different USDA quality grades (Upper 2 / 3 Choice and Select), thicknesses (thick and thin), and grill surface temperatures (high and low) cooked to the same internal degree of doneness {{to determine if a}} specific set of cooking parameters would create a profound difference in the eating characteristics, described by the tenderness and juiciness of cooked beef strip steaks. The elastic behavior of the surface and centers of beef steaks were analyzed to determine how the microstructure of the beef responded to applied stress. The elastic behavior of steak centers was influenced in a three-way interaction between USDA Quality Grade, steak thickness, and grill surface temperature while the elastic behavior of the surface of steaks was influenced only by USDA Quality Grade and steak thickness. These interactions along with the differences in the thermal characteristic of proteins suggest that the microstructure of beef steaks is significantly affected by each cooking treatment group. The physical properties in the beef steaks further support through more tangible applications that the composition, thickness, and cooking regiments impact the microstructure and thermal properties of beef and thus final tenderness and texture. This project identified cooking preparation should take into consideration that quality grade, thickness and cooking temperature will affect the textural eating qualities of beef steaks. Choice steaks were shown to be ideally sliced thick and cooked on a low <b>grill</b> surface temperature <b>supported</b> by the springiness, hardness, expressible moisture, and rheological data. Select steaks were not always effected by grill surface temperature and had similar results among the different measurements but the hardness, resilience and chewiness values along with viscosity suggest a thick steak cooked at a high grill surface temperature. Therefore, cooking parameters may be utilized as a mechanism to enhance beef steak palatability...|$|R
