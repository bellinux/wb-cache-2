40|$|Building a robot {{from scratch}} in an {{educational}} context {{can be a}} challenging prospect. While a multitude of projects exist that simplify the electronics and software aspects of a robot, the same cannot be said for construction systems for robotics. In this paper, we present our efforts to create a low-cost do-it-yourself construction system for small robots. We have created three different construction systems (laser-cut screw connectors, printed friction-fit <b>connectors,</b> and printed <b>hybrid</b> <b>connectors)</b> using small aluminium T-slot extrusions, based on prior work done by Industrial Design college students. Eighty-six secondary school students and 35 teachers tested these three systems during a five-day robotics contest where they had to build firefighting robots. Follow-up questionnaires and an expert evaluation were {{used to measure the}} usability, affective appraisal and functionality of the three systems in order to determine which system should serve as a basis for further design iterations. Overall, a clear preference was shown for the hybrid system, which relies on its interlocking shape as well as on a screw connection to create robot frames that are both quick to construct and very rigid once assembled. We believe our work represents a solid first step toward an inexpensive, “hackable” construction system for educational robotics...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} connectorized, subsea fiber-optic data link was {{installed}} on the Phillips “Little Dotty ” field in January of 1997, the subsea oil industry has seen a number of projects, where optical fiber has been either critical to the program or has offered significant cost or performance advantages. These projects {{have been at the}} forefront of recent tieback technology development, and have been as diverse as the Norsk Hydro Troll Pilot subsea separation system and the Petrobras SBMS multiphase pump project, to new downhole gauges with remote, real time monitoring, such as the Shell ETAP program. Many of these projects have already been installed or are scheduled for phased installation over the next year or two. Optical fiber has been critical to these programs for a variety of reasons, ranging from data security for fiscal metering subsea through communication bandwidth and electrical noise immunity, to CAPEX reduction for Integrated Service Umbilicals for very deep-water installation (> 2000 m). Many of the goals for the tieback community can be achieved only with the aid of fiber-optic communication. Long step-out distances, or eventually tieback to shore, can benefit from fiber’s unrepeated communication distances of greater than 100 km. High-power, subsea pumps needed to pressure boost fluids over these step-out distances need electrical noise immunity, inherent in optical fiber. Umbilicals designed for long step-outs can be more cost efficient using optical fiber in high-density, small cable designs. While the control systems for complex subsea installations need increased bandwidth, which can easily be supplied by optical fiber, while wet-mate <b>hybrid</b> <b>connectors</b> allow modular installation...|$|R
5000|$|An {{enhanced}} mini-USB (EMU) connector {{is a type}} of <b>hybrid</b> electrical <b>connector</b> {{which carries}} Universal Serial Bus data and power as well as other connections such as bidirectional audio. It was invented for and is mainly used on mobile phones. Motorola, HTC Corporation, and other mobile phone manufacturers use EMU connectors. [...] There is more than one standard for EMU connectors, which are incompatible between manufacturers, but all are physically and electrically compatible with standard mini-USB connectors. The EMU connector has five pins for USB on one side. While regular USB connectors are empty on the other side, EMU has more pins intended for headsets. In HTC's version, two pins are for the microphone, three are for stereo sound, and one is for the push-to-talk switch.|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. In steel construction, {{there are}} various seismic {{structural}} systems that have been successfully utilized in the past including eccentric and concentric braced frames and moment frame systems. When these systems are used, the building envelope between structural members is filled with architectural components such as masonry infill walls, which are only expected to carry out of plane loads, such as wind, on each individual wall panel. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively new}} type of structural system which incorporates the masonry infill walls within steel frames into the structural system to resist lateral loads imposed on the structure. This research represents the third phase of testing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and is part of an ongoing project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) to investigate the applicability of hybrid masonry as an adequate structural system. In phases I and II of <b>hybrid</b> masonry <b>connector</b> plate development research at UHM, a wide variety of connector designs were explored to determine the positive and negative aspects to different fuse and link connector plate designs and connection methods. Fuse connector tests demonstrated the viability of tapered fuses to dissipate large amounts of energy during cyclic loading. These tests also showed that various practical connector orientations and methods can be applied for <b>hybrid</b> masonry <b>connectors,</b> particularly the straight bolted side plate connection. In addition, during phase I of testing, a series of bolt push out tests were performed to determine the shear strength of post-installed through-bolts in masonry. Observations from the first two phases of testing were used as a guide for selecting 4 -inch and 6 -inch tapered fuse designs for testing on partially grouted and fully grouted masonry wall specimens. Multiple pairs of both tapered fuse connectors were slip-critically bolted to side plates, which were welded to a steel beam above the masonry wall specimens. These tests were performed to verify that the behavior of multiple pairs of connector plates in series is similar to the behavior of the individual pairs of connector plates. In addition, the tests were performed to observe the interaction between the steel connector plates and masonry wall specimens. Based on numerous observations and results in this phase of testing, the design of Type I hybrid masonry connections was improved. The fuse connector tests showed that the strength and behavior of multiple pairs of fuse connectors can be approximated by designing a single connector plate and multiplying the single plate's capacity by the number of connector plates used. These fuse connectors displayed the capability of dissipating large amounts of seismic energy before failure. Based on the results of these connector subassembly tests, recommended design procedures for connector plates were modified. Both masonry walls failed by means of shear friction at the location of the joint between the masonry and concrete slab. The results from UHM's testing will guide the development of full-scale two-story hybrid masonry test frames which will be tested at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Hybrid masonry {{construction}} has relatively recently been {{developed as a}} means to provide a more efficient use of masonry infill walls by designing these walls to function {{as a part of a}} structure's lateral force resisting system, with current applications in low seismic regions (Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C). In regions of higher seismicity (Seismic Design Categories D and greater), there exists a much greater need for a clearer understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the steel frame of a building and the masonry shear wall as well as the development of specific detailing requirements to provide for a ductile and somewhat predictable response in a seismic event of significant magnitude. The scope of this thesis is the investigation of the connection between the steel beam and the top of the masonry wall for a Type I hybrid masonry system, using a proposed steel connector plate through-bolted to the masonry wall bond beam, in order to provide preliminary guidelines and recommendations for the development of energy dissipating <b>hybrid</b> masonry <b>connector</b> plates. The first portion of this study focused on the development of connector plate designs to determine which provided the most stable, ductile cyclic response. The second portion of this study investigated the strength and limit states of the through-bolted connection to the masonry wall bond beam under shear loading. Based on these experiments, recommendations are provided for the most suitable connector plate designs as well as a general evaluation of the connection to the masonry wall and potential limit states to consider in future design applications. For a "rigid" connection between the steel frame and CMU wall, link connectors with a thickness greater than 0. 5 inches is recommended, whereas fuse Type T was proven to be superior for a ductile, energy dissipating connector plate. ACI 530 - 08 design values for bolt shear yielding and masonry shear failure were determined to be the most appropriate limit states for determining an approximate design values for the thru-bolted CMU wall connections...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This report {{details the}} research, design, {{development}} {{and testing of}} the third generation underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) produced by the University of Cape Town’s Robotics and Agents Research Laboratory (RARL). The ROV was designed and built {{in response to a}} request from the Department of Zoology for an ROV to aid their oceanic research. The two generations that had gone before this ROV had provided the research group with good experience, but a new vehicle was required that would offer a more robust research tool for the zoologists and a more versatile platform for future development within the RARL. ROV System Together with project partner Thomas Knight, a new ROV design was developed that was based on the open frame designs commonly used on commercially available ROVs. The ROV was to be propelled by five individual thruster modules and carried four high-powered LED light modules to provide lighting for the ROV’s forward and aft video cameras. In order to navigate the ROV a sonar unit was also incorporated on board. In order to provide power and communications from the surface station to each of the modules on board the ROV, distribution systems for each were required. As the project progressed, it became clear that these distribution systems were critical to the reliability and versatility of the vehicle and became the focus of the author’s scope. The report starts with a description of the design process that resulted in the decision to design a new ROV and then a brief description is provided of the ROV systems incorporated in the final design. The detailed design of the power and communications distribution systems is then presented using a bottom-up design approach, starting with the distribution of power and communications on board the ROV. Brief descriptions of the major components in these systems follow below. Electronics Pod The Electronics Pod (E-Pod) was designed to distribute power to each module on the ROV at the required voltages and currents, and to distribute serial communications to each module over an RS- 485 multi-drop network. The E-Pod incorporated two microcontrollers that were used to control the switching of power to each of the modules and were also connected on the RS- 485 communications network. This RS- 485 network was connected to the surface via an optical fibre link in the ROV’s tether, and the two converters required to establish this link were also housed in the E-Pod. Video feeds from the on-board cameras were fed into an encoder in the E-Pod and transmitted to the surface controller also via the fibre link. The power required by the E-Pod was drawn from the Power Pod on the ROV, which is described below. Power Pod The Power Pod was designed to convert the 400 VDC supply from the tether into 5 V, 12 V, 15 V and 48 V, which were required by the E-Pod. A total of 1. 66 kW was to be supplied to the E-Pod so compact, high-power DC-DC converters were integrated into the design of custom-made printed circuit boards (PCBs) in order to provide the required power. Currents sensors, temperature sensors and voltage level sensors were incorporated in the Power Pod circuitry. A microcontroller in the Power Pod was used to read all of the sensors and communicate the values to the surface controller via the E-Pod. Subsea Junction Box Because the ROV’s tether contained copper cores for power transmission and optical fibres for communications transmission, a very expensive <b>hybrid</b> subsea <b>connector</b> was required if it was to plug directly into the Power Pod or E-Pod. A junction box was therefore designed in which the copper cores of tether were separated from the optical fibres. The copper cores were fed to the Power Pod and the optical fibres to the E-Pod. The junction box was filled with oil and pressure compensated {{to reduce the risk of}} water ingress. Surface Power Supply Unit Including power losses in the distribution system, 2 kW of power was required to be supplied to the tether. A surface power supply unit (PSU) was designed with an isolated, ungrounded 400 VDC power supply, which ran off a standard 230 V, 16 A mains supply. Start and emergency-stop switches were provided on the PSU enclosure, as well as a lockable isolator. The PSU incorporated an Ethernet network switch and fibre optic media converter to provide the link necessary between the tether and the laptop running the user interface and sonar software...|$|R
