5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to <b>flamingos</b> as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought <b>flamingos</b> would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink <b>flamingos.</b> Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>flamingo</b> (Phoenicopterus ruber) {{is a large}} {{species of}} <b>flamingo</b> {{closely related to the}} greater <b>flamingo</b> and Chilean <b>flamingo.</b> It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific with the greater <b>flamingo,</b> but that treatment is now widely viewed (e.g. by the American and British Ornithologists' Unions) as incorrect {{due to a lack of}} evidence. It is also known as the Caribbean <b>flamingo</b> although it is present in the Galápagos Islands.

The Chilean <b>flamingo,</b> Andean <b>flamingo</b> and James's <b>flamingo</b> are all sympatric, and all live in colonies (including shared nesting areas). The James's <b>flamingo</b> was thought to have been extinct until a remote {{population}} was discovered in 1956.|$|R
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, <b>flamingos</b> and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. <b>Flamingos,</b> three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E

As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring planar {{polarization}} of the Drosophila wing epithelium, the homophilic adhesion molecule <b>Flamingo</b> localizes to proximal/distal cell boundaries {{in response to}} Frizzled signaling; perturbing Frizzled signaling alters <b>Flamingo</b> distribution, many cell diameters distant, by a mechanism that is not well understood. This work identifies a tissue polarity gene, diego, that comprises six ankyrin repeats and colocalizes with <b>Flamingo</b> at proximal/distal boundaries. Diego is specifically required for polarized accumulation of <b>Flamingo</b> and drives ectopic clustering of <b>Flamingo</b> when overexpressed. Our data suggest that Frizzled acts through Diego to promote local clustering of <b>Flamingo,</b> and that clustering of Diego and <b>Flamingo</b> in one cell nonautonomously propagates to others...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink <b>Flamingos</b> (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 <b>flamingos</b> rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
5|$|When the Sun Sox {{released}} him, Martin {{was hired}} to manage the Miami Beach <b>Flamingos</b> of the Florida International League in 1952. Despite leading them to a 103-49 record, the Flamigos finished the season one game behind his former team, the Sun Sox. In 1953, he became {{the manager of the}} Fort Lauderdale Lions and led them to the Florida International League title. After spending the 1954 season as the manager for the Portsmouth Merrimacs, Martin was named as a coach for the Chicago Cubs in September 1955. Stan Hack was fired as the Cubs manager when they finished in last place in the 1956 season, and the new Cubs manager, Bob Scheffing, asked for Martin's resignation {{along with the rest of}} the coaching staff. Martin returned to the minor leagues once again where he became a player-coach for the Tulsa Oilers, playing his final game at the age of 54. He took his final field assignment as the manager of the Miami Marlins in 1959.|$|E

5|$|With Pink <b>Flamingos</b> (1972) and Reefer Madness (1936) {{making money}} in midnight showings nationwide, a Fox executive, Tim Deegan, {{was able to}} talk {{distributors}} into midnight screenings, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976. The cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City., then spread to other counties in NYC, and to Uniondale, L.I. Rocky Horror was not only found in the larger cities but throughout the United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the film's release included The U.A. Cinemas in Fresno and Merced, The Cinema J in Sacramento, California, and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organised performance group was active with the release there {{as well as in}} such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.|$|E
25|$|The {{presumption}} {{of a shared}} evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can sometimes elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, {{there has been a}} dispute about whether <b>flamingos</b> are more closely related to the storks or to the ducks. The fact that <b>flamingos</b> share parasites with ducks and geese was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks. However, evolutionary events such as the duplication or extinction of parasite species (without similar events on the host phylogeny) often erode similarities between host and parasite phylogenies. In the case of <b>flamingos,</b> they have similar lice to those of grebes. <b>Flamingos</b> and grebes do have a common ancestor, implying cospeciation of birds and lice in these groups. Flamingo lice then switched hosts to ducks, creating the situation which had confused biologists.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flamingo</b> is {{a member}} of the adhesion-GPCR family of proteins. <b>Flamingo</b> has {{sequence}} homology to cadherins and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). <b>Flamingo</b> was originally identified as a Drosophila protein involved in planar cell polarity.

25|$|In addition, a {{study on}} Chilean <b>flamingos</b> (Phoenicopterus chilensis) found that birds in a bond were much more {{aggressive}} than single birds. The paired birds {{were significantly more likely}} to start an agonistic encounter in defense of their mate or young whereas single birds were typically non-breeding and less likely to fight. Not all <b>flamingos</b> can mate in the population because of an unsuitable sex ratio or some dominant <b>flamingos</b> mating with multiple partners. Mates are a fiercely contested resource in many species as the production of offspring is essential for an individual to propagate its genes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{atypical}} cadherin <b>Flamingo</b> plays {{key roles}} {{in a number}} of developmental processes. We have used the sensory nervous system of the Drosophila embryo to shed light on the mechanism by which <b>Flamingo</b> regulates axon growth. <b>flamingo</b> loss of function mutants display a highly penetrant sensory axon stall phenotype. The location of these axon stalls is stereotypic and corresponds to the position of intermediate target cells, with which sensory axons associate during normal development. This suggests that <b>Flamingo</b> mediates an interaction between the sensory neuron growth cones and these intermediate targets, which is required for continued axon advance. Mutant rescue experiments show that <b>Flamingo</b> expression is required only in sensory neurons for normal axon growth. The <b>flamingo</b> mutant phenotype can be partially rescued by expressing a <b>Flamingo</b> construct lacking most of the extracellular domain, suggesting that regulation of sensory axon advance by <b>Flamingo</b> does not absolutely depend upon a homophilic Flamingo–Flamingo interaction or its ability to mediate cell–cell adhesion. Loss of function mutants for a number of key genes that act together with <b>Flamingo</b> in the planar cell polarity pathway do not display the highly penetrant stalling phenotype seen in <b>flamingo</b> mutants...|$|R
