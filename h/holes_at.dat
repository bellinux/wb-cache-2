5|$|In {{response}} to concerns and recommendations {{raised by the}} Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> dawn and dusk. Their legs are feathered {{down to the}} toes.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when {{a star in}} a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E
5000|$|The 16th <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> Edzell {{golf course}}, the 5th <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> Strathtay golf course, and the 2nd <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> Traigh golf course are each named Spion Kop.|$|R
5000|$|Typically made of stamped {{steel or}} forged alloy, {{it has a}} large <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> the bottom for {{connecting}} to one's harness and a smaller <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> the top for attaching a retrieval cord {{in case of a}} fall.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{during a}} {{practice}} round, García made an albatross (double eagle) on the par-5 second <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> the Masters, {{one of the}} few players to have ever done so. On the 575 yd <b>hole</b> <b>at</b> the Augusta National Golf Club, he holed a 253 yd 2-iron following a 325 yd drive.|$|R
5|$|Galaxies are {{categorized}} {{according to}} their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies {{are thought to have}} black <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke <b>holes.</b> <b>At</b> one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power. Solar activity {{is thought to have}} played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|There are eleven {{golf courses}} {{open to the}} public in the city, as well as four country club layouts and 36 {{military}} <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> NAS Oceana's Aeropines course. Among the best-known public courses are Hell's Point Golf Club and Virginia Beach National, the latter of which hosted the Virginia Beach Open, a Nationwide Tour event from 2000 to 2006. Also, the Kingsmill Resort hosts the Kingsmill Championship, an annual LPGA Tour tournament.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom of}} {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, {{making it difficult for}} plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E

25|$|Nine <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> Langston re-opened in September 1976, and the {{remaining}} nine holes on April 15, 1977. The National Park Service began {{looking for a new}} concessionaire to take over the park in September 1977.|$|E

25|$|Lee began a {{noticeable}} return {{to form a}} couple of months into the new year. A tie for 7th in the Chitimacha Louisiana Open was followed by a strong showing for 54 <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> the Malaysian Open, eventually being disqualified for signing an incorrect final round scorecard (denying him a tie for 17th). The next week he tied for 2nd at the Volvo China Open, four shots behind winner Nicolas Colsaerts.|$|E
25|$|Note that if {{a normal}} right-side-drive {{crankset}} is installed backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} crank arms would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen the pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.|$|E
25|$|Leakage was {{affected}} by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed. In summer when the springs receded, water was lost through these <b>holes</b> <b>at</b> a rate greater than the available supply. In one of the attempts to rectify this problem, {{the size of the}} locks was reduced which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance. In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King's Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay.|$|E
