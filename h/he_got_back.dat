25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but {{he somehow}} managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, {{but it was too}} quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E

The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up.

In the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, he {{fought against the}} British. Wounded {{three times in the}} action, he required several months of convalescence. At the end of the Siege of Alexandria on 2 September 1801, he was ordered to sign the articles of capitulation. He {{became a member of the}} legion d'honneur on 11 December 1803 and served in the Bordeaux military district as a dragoon commander.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after they}} moved to Monastir, the Husainid Dynasty made many reforms for Tunisia to avoid the fate of Ottoman Algeria who had just being colonized by France, in 1830. The reforms {{included}} the establishment of new institutions in order to compete with Europe. But this attempt was a complete failure and ended with a financial crisis. In order to repay foreign loans, the Tunisian government raised the taxes of the mejba. But this resulted in dissatisfaction of the Tunisian people who decided to revolt in 1864. The uprising ended with a terrible repression: The bey decided to punish any person {{who had participated in}} the event. Therefore, the bey sent general Ahmed Zarrouk to Monastir in order to pacify the situation. Thus, he arrested the city's notables, including Mohamed Bourguiba and his brother, who were detained in a beylical camp settled at the west of the city. They were freed only with the family's efforts who sacrificed all their wealth, jewelry, money and properties. The youngest of Mohamed Bourguiba's sons, Ali, who was only 14, was responsible for bringing the ransom to the general's tent. He was noticed by Zarrouck who saw in him a good recrew for his troops and decided to enroll him in the army. Therefore, Ali spent 19 years of his life campaigning, before ending his military career with the rank of sergeant-in-chief and a quarterly pension of 11.25 francs. However, Mohamed Bourguiba passed away on the very night <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> home, in 1865.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} United's {{last two games}} was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United {{got off to a}} great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a {{deflected}} shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were looking to be settling into a rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball nestled in the bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to {{the last day of the}} season for the first time since 1999.|$|E

500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential {{to the story of}} characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed". He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied once <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Beadle {{later wrote}} to his fellow High Court judge Benjamin Goldin {{that he thought he}} had [...] "saved the situation" [...] by going to London, [...] having persuaded Wilson to give some ground on the terms for the Royal Commission, but his trip alarmed the pro-UDI camp in the Rhodesian Cabinet, who feared that Beadle might be {{carrying}} a message to the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs telling him to [...] parliament. Smith and his Cabinet declared independence on 11 November 1965, while Beadle was at Lusaka Airport on his way home. Smith later rejected the suggestion that Beadle could have had anything significant to tell them on his return, saying that [...] "the only thing that Beadle could have done when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> was to have talked us out of insisting on our questions".|$|E

His business became larger, with hundreds of employees and international operations; he had become a millionaire by the 1960s.

500|$|On 22 October, Benfica hosted Estrela da Amadora. The {{visitors}} scored first though Dário, but Benfica equalized in {{the first}} half and scored two more goals in the second, winning the match 3–1. Santos was highly critical of the referee Carlos Xistra, who issued 18 yellow cards and three red cards, one of them to Miccoli, who would therefore miss the next match, a visit to Porto. Five days later, Benfica played Porto {{in the first}} Clássico of the season. In a high-tension match, Benfica conceded two goals {{in the first half}} but equalized in the second half, drawing the game in the 82th minute. However, in injury time, Bruno Moraes scored, bringing the score to 3–2 to Porto. Santos said the result was unfair, adding, [...] "After <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> into the game and managed to level it, 'that' happened in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} hear from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
500|$|Taylor said Marvel's The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon rewrote several {{scenes in}} the film explaining, [...] "Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times.

In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the [...] "Loki trilogy", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film.
