40|$|Evaluation of {{previously}} established field trials of remedial internal treatments demonstrates the continued performance of chioropicrin, Vorlex, and methylisothiocyanate (MITC). While {{the degree of}} protection afforded by these treatments has declined with time, residual fungitoxic levels remain in many tests. Field trials of gelatin encapsulated MITC indicate that gelatin had no negative effect on fumigant performance even when no water was added {{at the time of}} treatment. Closed tube bioassays, chemical analyses, and culturing of Douglas-fir and southern pine poles treated with glass encapsulated METC (MITC-Fume) indicate that this chemical is outperforming metham sodium 3 years after application. While the glass vials lost chemical very slowly, the slow release rate did not appear to adversely affect MITC performance. Trials to evaluate the performance of fused borate rods were sampled after 1 or 2 years of exposure. Chemical analysis of cores removed from the test poles revealed that none of the treatments contained boron at levels which would be considered adequate for arresting or preventing colonization by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, boron levels in poles exposed in Hilo, Hawaii were highest above the treatment hole, suggesting that some upward diffusion of this chemical is possible. The low boron levels in these poles are reason for concern, since a number of utilities are considering the using this formulation for remedial treatment at the groundline. Evaluations of new solid fumigants are progressing. Trials with Basamid indicate that the addition of copper compounds improved the rate of decomposition to produce MITC. Simultaneous addition of copper sulfate and Basamid may be useful for accelerating the decomposition of this compound, making it practical for control of internal decay fungi. Trials have been established to evaluate the performance of gelled and pelletized metham sodium and a sodium fluoride/boron rod. These trials will be evaluated in future reports. A third field trial to evaluate the performance of a copper naphthenate/boron paste for internal treatment of Douglas-fir poles is currently be evaluated to determine chemical levels 3 years after treatment. The performance of gelled metham sodium was further evaluated under laboratory conditions to better understand the performance of this chemical. Gelled metham sodium provided improved fungal control in comparison with liquid metham sodium and appeared to produce increased MITC levels under a variety of test conditions. The improved performance of this formulation may reflect the ability of the gell to retain moisture {{for longer periods of time}} than the liquid metham sodium formulation. Further studies of this formulation are underway. Laboratory studies were also performed to evaluate the effects of various additives on the performance of Basamid. Once again, the addition of copper compounds enhanced the production of MITC. A number of other compounds shifted decomposition to the production of carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide, two less fungitoxic compounds. Further studies are underway to identify non-sulfur products which may provide some protection against wood decay fungi. Evaluations of the effects of artificial voids on performance of fumigants in Douglas-fir poles indicate that voids had little or no effect on fumigant distribution. As a result, fumigant treatment of solid wood around voids represents a viable strategy for improving pole service life. Evaluation of timbers treated with metham sodium indicate that detectable levels of MITC were present one year after treatment. These timbers will be evaluated in subsequent years to determine the protective period provided by fumigants in sawn material. We continue development of a fumigant movement model using data previously developed on MITC. This year, we evaluated a previously developed system, ANSYS. Results of preliminary trials are similar to data previously developed on MITC-Fume treated poles and indicate that modeling MITC movement should be possible. Further trials are underway to confirm and expand this model. The effect of wood moisture content, temperature and wood species on metham sodium decomposition was investigated under laboratory conditions. The efficiency of dcomposition to MITC varied widely, but was most affected by temperature and wood moisture content. The results suggests that there is considerable potential for improving decomposition efficiency to enhance performance of this fumigant. Further studies to characterize the relationship between chemical content of the wood species and decomposition are underway. Field trials to identify safer treatments for preventing decay of cedar sapwood and protecting field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> holes are continuing. Diffusible treatments continue to provide excellent protection for field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> holes. A study to develop estimates of the extent of decay above the groundline in Douglas-fir poles in the Pacific Northwest is underway. The data from this study will be used to develop estimates of the potential for damage and provide some insight into the extent of this problem. Studies to develop guidelines for sterilization of Douglas-fir poles following air-seasoning are continuing. Evaluations of internal temperature development during kiln-drying were completed this year and indicate that internal temperatures during typical pole drying schedules were more than adequate for acheiving sterilization. Further evaluations of the data are underway to develop reliable heating curves for this process. Evaluations of groundline preservative systems have been established at Corvallis, OR and Merced, CA. The results indicate that all of the formulations are moving well through the wood in a manner similar to that found with pentachlorophenol-based systems. Chemical levels in some treatments; however, are beginning to decline 30 months after treatment. Studies are now underway to establish thresholds for combinations of the various formulations. Copper naphthenate treated western redcedar stakelets continue to perform well in fungus cellar trials. Stakes weathered prior to treatment are degrading slightly faster, while freshly sawn stakelets continue to perform well. Field trials have also been established to evaluate the performance of copper naphthenate treated Douglas-fir utility poles in California and Oregon. The chemical levels and fungal colonization will be monitored in these poles to provide a guide to performance of this chemical in western wood species...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{previously}} established field trials of internal remedial treatments continues {{to verify the}} excellent long-term protection afforded by these treatments. Field trials with gell encapsulated methylisothiocyanate (MITC) demonstrate that gelatin does not interfere with chemical release, nor is addition of supplemental moisture required for release. Field trials have been established to evaluate several new formulations including Basamid plus copper, boron/fluoride rods, and boron rods. Field trials of gelled and pelletized metham sodium indicate that both formulations are moving well through Douglas-fir poles one year after treatment. Evaluations of a copper naphthenate/boron paste for internal treatment indicate that the formulation has moved {{a short distance from}} the point of application 3 years after treatment. Boron rod field trials were not fully sampled for residual chemical level this past year; however, evaluation of cores removed from fused borate rod trials in New York indicate that some additional boron diffusion has occurred. Examination of treatment holes suggests that considerable amounts of the boron remain in rod form 2 years after application. In laboratory studies, we have evaluated the use of metham sodium/basamid mixtures and have found that these formulations provide enhanced MITC production over longer periods than either of the components alone. Both formulations were solid, creating the potential for development of safer formulations which provide a rapid release with long term protection. Field trials of these systems will be established in the coming months. Studies also continue with Basamid in an effort to enhance decomposition of this compound. Studies have shown that moisture addition has the most significant effect on decomposition followed by the presence of copper and increasing pH. Further studies on decomposition products are planned to better understand the activity of this molecule. Examination of Douglas-fir timbers treated with metham sodium indicate that MITC levels are similar to those found in poles at similar times after treatment. The presence increased surface area on timbers apparently did not adversely affect diffusion or chemical loss. Evaluation of the fungitoxicity of mixtures of MITC and carbon disulfide is underway in an effort better understand the activity of metham sodium. This compound decomposes to produce a wide array of volatile compounds with varying degrees of toxicity to fungi. Preliminary trials have shown the relatively low toxicity associated with carbon disulfide, a major decomposition product, particularly under acidic conditions. Trials with mixtures will begin shortly. Efforts to develop a three dimensional model of MITC movement are continuing. The model has been evaluated on data collected from small blocks and efforts are underway to verify these results. In addition, full pole grids have been prepared to evaluate the effects of treatment hole geometry and orientation on fumigant movement. Studies to identify alternative treatments for protecting western redcedar sapwood from decay are continuing. A variety chemicals {{have been shown to be}} effective 5 years after treatment; however, longer term trials of other formulations suggests that performance declines rapidly at longer time points. Field trials of remedial treatments for field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> holes continue to demonstrate the performance of diffusible boron and fluoride for preventing fungal attack. These trials will be evaluated again in the coming year. Inspection of the above ground region of Douglas-fir poles in the Pacific Northwest have shown that many poles are colonized by decay fungi far above the groundline. Fungal incidence was greatest in poles near the coast, but decay fungi were also isolated from poles in drier climates. Sampling of additional poles is planned to provide a more detailed analysis of the risk of above ground decay in this region. Efforts are also continuing to evaluate the performance of through-bored Douglas-fir poles to provide better data on the degree of preservative penetration required in the through-bored zone to achieve optimum performance. These trials have shown that most poles are well treated, but no decay has been detected in the through bored zone of poles with as little as 60...|$|E
40|$|The Cooperative {{continues}} to actively address a {{diverse array of}} {{issues related to the}} effective use of wood utility poles. The trials {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} MITC-Fume are now in their seventh year and continue to show that methylisothiocyanate (MITC) levels in MITC-Fume treatments remain higher than comparable metham sodium treatments. The levels of chemical are, however, declining, suggesting that this treatment may need replenishment in 3 to 5 years. Trials with the solid wood fumigant Basamid continue to show that MITC release can be enhanced by addition of small amounts of copper. Field trials suggest that these additives become less important with time. As a result, unamended Basamid may be suitable for treatment where the risk of immediate decay is not high, but the utility wishes to protect against future attack. Field trials with various water-diffusible internal treatments continue to show that these treatments move more slowly through Douglas-fir heartwood than do fumigants. Boron levels in pole sections treated with fused borate rods remain at levels that will protect against fungal attack 6 years after treatment. Similar trials with a boron/ fluoride rod indicate that neither fluoride or boron levels in the poles are adequate for wood protection 2 years after treatment. While the dosages tested were relatively low, the volumes of chemical were similar to the liquid volumes normally applied during internal remedial treatment. We will sample these poles next year to ensure that our measurements accurately reflect the chemical levels present. Trials to evaluate the effects of glycol on boron movement from fused borate rods suggest that glycol enhanced boron diffusion to only a slight extent. This effect was most pronounced at lower moisture contents. This trial was established to identify methods for improving boron movement in drier wood. In addition, moisture measurements in these poles suggest the internal wood moisture content varies widely both seasonally and positionally. While elevated moisture levels can negatively affect the movement of gaseous fumigants, excess moisture is critical for diffusion of boron or fluoride and its absence around the treatment site can markedly reduce the efficacy of rod treatments. These poles will continue to be monitored to assess both boron movement and seasonal changes in moisture content. Trials to identify safe, effective and easily used systems for protecting wood exposed during field fabrication are continuing. Boron and fluoride continue to provide excellent protection to field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> holes. These treatments are safe and easy to apply, and have provided protection in our field test for 14 years. Trials of similar formulations on simulated decking are also reported to provide additional information on the ability of boron and fluoride to protect exposed Douglas-fir heartwood. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of through boring as a method for enhancing the treatment of Douglas-fir poles are continuing. This past year, we evaluated preservative distribution around through bored holes as a means of developing optimum through boring patterns that maximized treatment while minimizing potential strength effects. These trials suggest the diamond shaped through boring zone of effect is relatively narrow. This information will be used in the coming year to construct optimum patterns for poles of various classes. The goal of this project is to develop a standard through boring pattern that would permit automation of the process. This would create the potential for cost savings on new poles. Trials to evaluate the durability of western redcedar are nearly complete. These trials were initiated because of concerns that second growth western redcedar might be less durable than poles cut from older trees. As expected, cedar varied widely in its resistance to fungal attack. This resistance, however, was not related to tree age, suggesting that there might not be a difference between so-called "old-growth" and "second growth" material. These data will be more thoroughly analyzed once the final set of trials are completed. In addition, we are evaluating more rapid methods for assessing cedar durability by measuring tropolone content. Tropolones are an important component of the extractives that make cedar heartwood so durable. Field trials of various externally applied supplemental groundline treatments are continuing at sites in Oregon, California, and New York. Trials in Corvallis, Oregon, have shown that various copper naphthenate, fluoride or boron based systems are at least as effective as the pentachlorophenol (penta) based systems that were formerly used for this purpose. Penta concentrations in one system have now declined below a protective level, while the copper based systems continue to remain at a protective level. Field trials in California are following similar trends and indicate that the alternative systems will provide comparable performance. Fungus cellar trials of copper naphthenate treated western redcedar stakes continue to show that this chemical provides excellent protection to cedar sapwood. Weathered wood that was treated with copper naphthenate {{continues to}} perform more poorly than freshly sawn wood treated to similar retention levels. Variations in permeability likely account for these differences. A new Wood Pole Maintenance Manual has been completed and is now ready for distribution. This update of the 1979 publication includes more information on initial pole procurement and closely follows the video by the same name that we produced in 1994...|$|E

40|$|Previously {{established}} {{field trials}} of MTTC-Fume continue {{to show that}} this chemical remains in Douglas-fir and southern pine poles at fungitoxic levels 5 years after treatment. In general, increasing dosages resulted in higher chemical levels in the poles. All of the MITC-Fume treatments resulted in higher residual M 1 TC levels than comparable metham sodium treatments. Field trials with solid basaniid with and without copper sulfate continue to show the promise of this chemical. Basamid treated poles continue to contain MITC at levels which exceed those for comparable metham sodium treatments. These results, which are currently being confirmed in poles in service, indicate that this formulation can deliver fiingitoxic MITC levels to wood in service, without the risk of spills associated with metham sodium. We have completed trials with gelled and pelletized metham sodium formulations. Both of these formulations offered improved safety during application. Initial laboratory trials also suggested that the gelled formulation was more effective than comparable liquid metham sodium. Field trials, however, indicate that the formulations provided protection comparable to the liquid formulation in poles over the test period. The gelled formulation still offers the advantage of reduced risks of spills during application. Trials are also continuing with various solid, water diffusible treatments for arresting internal decay. Trials of fused borate rods continue to show that these treatments require more moisture for effective movement in Douglas-fir poles. Field trials have also been established with borate rods with glycol as an additive to determine if glycols can accelerate diffusion in drier wood. The poles in these trials have also been sensored to monitor internal moisture changes over {{time in order to}} better correlate boron diffusion with wood moisture content. Trials underway with a boronlfluoride rod indicate that the boron is diffusing well from these rods, while the fluoride is moving somewhat slower. Neither chemical has approached a fiungal threshold one year after treatment, but the combination of chemicals may lead to more effective fungal control. Trials with pelletized metham sodium/basamid mixtures suggests that using ratios of these two chemicals can produce an initial rapid burst ofMITC release followed by a slower MITC release with time. This combination allows for rapid control of existing fungal infestations followed by long term protection against reinvasion. These laboratory trials will be further confirmed with field trials. The trials to evaluate the effects of voids on fumigant movement initially suggested that voids have little influence on subsequent fumigant levels {{on either side of the}} void. Sampling 8 years after treatment, however, indicates that chioropicrin levels were generally higher in poles without voids. We plan further trials of actual field poles containing voids to confirm these effects. Trials to identify treatments for protecting the sapwood of western redcedar poles as well as wood exposed in field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> holes are continuing. Trials in western redcedar sapwood have identified a number of chemicals which can be remedially applied to protect this wood against fungal attack. At present, however, commercial pole spraying has largely ceased making further field trials difficult. Field trials to identify treatments for protecting untreated wood exposed during drilling for various pole attachments continue to show that diffusible boron and fluoride compounds provide excellent long term protection against flingal attack. The protective effects of one diffusible treatment, Boracol, however, has begun to decline. Further sampling will be undertaken to identify the long term effectiveness of the remaining treatments. Trials to identify enhanced patterns for through boring of Douglas-fir poles are complete. The results indicate that patterns as widely spaced as 400 mm apart longitudinally still produce a nearly completely treated pole i n the through bored zone. Pentachlorophenol levels in the through bored zone were generally above the threshold for ftrngal growth. Prior sampling of Douglas-fir poles in service suggest that even poles with small skips in the through bored zone contained no evidence of internal decay. These results suggest that the through boring pattern can be extended without adversely risking pole service life. A reduced through boring pattern would decrease treatment costs while minimizing impacts on pole strength. Trials to evaluate the application of boron to freshly peeled Douglas-fir poles as a means of preventing fungal colonization using a thermal process suggest that thermal treatment failed to produce a boron loading sufilcient to permit subsequent diffusion across the pole section after a 3 month diffusion period. Evaluations of various external groundline preservative formulations continue to indicate that replacement formulations based upon copper naphthenate, boron or fluoride perform comparably to earlier formulations employing pentachlorophenol and creosote. Pentachlorophenol levels in some treatments have fallen below the threshold for fungal growth, while those in all of the replacement treatments remain above a U protective level. These results suggest that the newer groundline preservative systems should provide a reasonable level of protection against external decay. Laboratory trials to better understand the levels of combinations of chemicals required for protection in the groundline zone are continuing. Fungal cellar evaluations of copper naphthenate treated western redcedar continue to show excellent performance at levels specified in the American Wood Preservers' Association Standards. Performance is generally better for wood which was freshly sawn prior to treatment, while wood cuts from weathered poles in service has provided slightly lower levels of protection. The weather wood apparently has higher permeability, making it more likely to lose chemical in soil contact. Further evaluations are planned...|$|E
40|$|The eighth {{annual report}} details {{continued}} progress {{on each of}} the five objectives. In this year's report, Objectives II and III from previous reports have been combined to reflect the similarity of each effort. Improved fumigants: The previously established field trials continue to demonstrate the superior performance of both chioropicrin and Vorlex after 18 years in poles and 13 years in piling. In addition, solid methylisothiocyanate (MIT) continues to protect Douglas-fir poles {{in a manner similar to}} Vorlex. Along with evaluations of existing registered formulations, we continue to explore the use of novel solid fumigants for their ability to arrest decay in Douglas-fir heartwood. Laboratory studies indicate that both Mylone and sodium n-methyldithiocarbamate (NaMDC) can be pelletized to improve handling safety. Previous studies indicate that the rate of decomposition to produce MIT is often too slow for effective fungal control, but the incorporation of certain buffers or metallic salts can alter the rate and characteristics of chemical decomposition. In our tests, the levels of chemical release varied with PH; however, complete fungal control was not achieved. Further studies are underway to determine if other conditions can alter the rate of MIT production by these compounds. Both chemicals are registered for other, nonfood uses and should be registerable for application to wood. Efforts to better understand the properties of MIT, the major fungitoxic product of both Vorlex and Vapam, are also continuing. These efforts have led to the development of a preliminary model to describe fumigant movement through Douglas-fir heartwood. The goal of this work is optimize treatment dosage and application patterns for various pole sizes. In addition to the more theoretical studies, we are continuing our efforts to determine the ability of fumigants to control decay fungi in poles containing large decay voids and to determine the levels of volatile emissions from fumigant treated wood. Field treatment: The field tests to evaluate potential replacements for pentachlorophenol (penta) treatment of western redcedar sapwood were evaluated after 7 years using the Aspergillus bioassay. The results indicate that residual levels of chemical were detectable in the penta treatments, but the remaining test chemicals exhibited little evidence of residual fungitoxicity. Further decay tests are planned on material removed from these pole sections. In addition to the pole sections, the small-scale test blocks were also evaluated using the Aspergillus bioassay. The results indicate that several chemicals remained in the wood at fungitoxic levels after one year of accelerated weathering. Further decay tests are also planned on these samples. The bolt hole study is now in its seventh year and the incidence of decay fungi in the test poles remains low. Variations in incidence from year to year have made it difficult to draw any useful conclusions from this study. To overcome this problem, a second test has been established which accelerates leaching and evaluates the ability of a test fungus to invade the field <b>drilled</b> <b>bolt</b> hole to cause wood weight loss. Decay detection and residual strength: We continue to evaluate the use of lectins for detecting fungal colonization at the early stages. This past year, we completed a comparison of colonization by three common decay fungi over a 12 week period. The search for small-scale methods for estimating residual strength is also continuing. Longitudinal compression measurements were used to determine residual strength of a pole involved in an automobile accident. ii Finally, we have completed portions of a study to determine the effects of fungal colonization on wood strength. Four fungi, Poria carbonica, Poria placenta, Peniophora spp., and Haematostereum sanguinolentum were evaluated in this study. Results with P. carbonica and Peniophora spp. indicate strength effects lag behind fungal colony development in small beams. These results were similar to previous field studies and indicate that air-seasoning for 2 to 3 years should not produce significant strength losses. Further studies with these fungi are underway. Initiation of decay in air-seasoning Douglas-fir: While the air-seasoning studies are now completed, we are continuing to evaluate the data from these tests. A detailed examination of the three year decay development study indicates that several fungi were typically found only in the heartwood or sapwood zones of the pole sections. In addition, the fungal flora at the four seasoning sites varied widely, with the greatest deviation occurring at the Oroville, CA. This site has the driest and warmest conditions, and would appear to be best site for seasoning. A detailed discussion of isolation frequency by position is presented for the eleven most common basidiomycetes. Studies to prevent colonization by basidiomycetes during air-seasoning are also continuing using polyborate dips or sprays. Sodium octaborate tetrahydrate appears to reduce the level of colonization after one year of air-seasoning at both Oroville and Corvallis, OR. Dipping shortly after peeling appeared to produce the best results, although spraying at regular intervals also had some effect on colonization. This study will continue for an additional two years. Determining the ability of existing pressure treatment cycles to eliminate fungi which colonize Douglas-fir poles during air-seasoning also remains a high priority. Only a few additional schedules were examined during iv the past year, but efforts to develop more realistic heating curves are under way. In addition, several questions concerning the accuracy of the existing data were answered. Additional studies using the Cellon process and the longer steaming period for the ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate treatments are planned in the coming year. While sterilization during preservative treatment is an important factor in pole longevity, questions have also arisen concerning the storage of poles for long periods after treatment. A survey of poles which were treated with creosote, pentachiorophenol, chromated copper arsenate, and ammoniacal copper arsenate prior to storage for one to 15 years was conducted. While colonization varied widely between sites, the results indicated that storage of poles for long periods substantially increased the risk that the pole would be placed in service with an active decay fungus established somewhere along its length. Several suggestions are made for remedying this situation. Effect of microfunqi on Douglas-fir poles: A study was conducted to determine the effect of microfungi which commonly colonize fumigant treated Douglas-fir heartwood on the ability of P. carbonica and P. placenta to cause wood weight loss in fumigant treated wood. The results indicate that several isolates were associated with reduced weight losses by these fungi. The decreased weight losses suggest that the microfungi could be colonizing fumigant treated poles prior to the basidiomycetes and, once there, could help prevent reinvasion. This scheme may help explain the remarkable protection provided by fumigant treatment. Further studies are underway to explore this possibility...|$|E

Two experiments {{were conducted in}} a virtual environment to determine optimal direction control-response relationships {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances. Direction errors were measured as a function of control orientation (horizontal or vertical), location (left, front, right) and directional control-response relationships. The results confirm that the principles of consistent direction and visual field compatibility are applicable to the majority of situations. An exception is that fewer direction errors were observed when an upward movement of a horizontal lever or movement of a vertical lever away from the participants caused extension (lengthening) of the controlled device, regardless of whether the direction of movement of the control is consistent with the direction in which the extension occurs. Further, both the control of slew by horizontally oriented controls and the control of device movements in a frontal plane by the perpendicular movements of vertical levers were associated with relatively high rates of directional errors, regardless of the directional control-response relationship, and these situations should be avoided. Statement of Relevance:The results are particularly applicable to the design of mining equipment such as <b>drilling</b> and <b>bolting</b> machines, and have been incorporated into MDG 35. 1 Guideline for <b>bolting</b> <b>drilling</b> plant in mines (Industry Investment NSW, 2010).

5000|$|Traditional climbing, or [...] "trad" [...] climbing, {{in which}} the leader uses mostly {{removable}} gear (and the occasional bolt placed on lead) to protect against falls. As with all partnered climbing involving belays the climbing team (a leader and follower, or multiple followers) begins {{at the bottom of}} a climb and ascends to the top, the leader placing protective devices in the rock as he/she climbs (Lead climbing). Once the leader is finished climbing, he/she establishes a belay. The follower then [...] "follows" [...] the route and removes all of the gear placed by the leader. It is important that the leader be proficient at placing trad (or clean or natural) gear (cams, stoppers, hexes, tri-cams, etc.) because his/her safety depends upon the soundness of each individual gear placement. Placing trad gear on lead can be time-consuming and thus tiring, sometimes making routes feel harder than their rating. Trad climbing is generally practiced according to ethical principles, that dictate primarily natural gear placements be made. However, when [...] "traditional" [...] was first coined in U.S. climbing literature, traditionalists of the day hand <b>drilled</b> <b>bolts</b> sometimes from delicate stances on lead when cams, stoppers, etc. were not possible to place. Some of the resulting traditional routes have long run outs between bolts, requiring a [...] "bold" [...] mentality. More important to the original traditionalists than bolting or not was the overall approach to climbing: no resting on the rope after falls, instead lowering to a stance or pitch beginning or even the ground for restart; no placing of protection from a top rope or rehearsing difficult moves over and over; and no fixing of ropes to high points (sieging) to return with aid for repeated tries. It is, with perhaps the exception of climbing with no rope and prior knowledge of a route Free-soloing, the purest form of climbing. Since the term traditional first emerged in U.S. climbing literature, its use has changed. Some, for example, now will call a climbing style [...] "trad" [...] only if no bolts are encountered, and may relax the old restraint of lowering off tension for restarts after a fall.|$|R

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of post mounts {{is that the}} bolt is threaded directly into the fork lowers. If the threads are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then the threads {{will need to be}} repaired, or the seized <b>bolt</b> <b>drilled</b> out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years post mount has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the brake calipers when using post mount. A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.|$|R

Indentation process, performed before the drilling operation, creates circumferential compression stresses around the hole which increase significantly the mechanical performance of the drilled structures. In this paper, static and the fatigue performances of aluminum–aluminum (AW 6082 -T 6) single-lap bolted joints are studied. In particular, the study compares the mechanical strength of only <b>drilled</b> single-lap <b>bolted</b> joints (OD specimens) and single-lap bolted joints subject to an indentation process (IP specimens). In order to determine the cycles to failure and the corresponding Wöhler diagram, several fatigue tests are performed. The analyses allow to determine the mechanical performance and the failure mode of the analyzed joints. Several numerical analysis, conducted in ANSYS environment on three-dimensional models of the single-lap joint, are focused on the evaluation of the residual stress on the indented plate and, in particular, to compare the stress distribution on both type of analyzed joints...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an {{invasive}} diagnostic pro-cedure in epilepsy {{surgery that}} is usually implemented with frame-based methods. OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique of frameless SEEG and report a prospective case series at a single center. METHODS: Image integration and planning of electrode trajectories were performed preoperatively on specialized software and exported to a Medtronic S 7 StealthStation. Trajectories were implemented by frameless stereotaxy using percutaneous <b>drilling</b> and <b>bolt</b> insertion. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients went this technique, with the insertion of 187 intra-cerebral electrodes. Of 187 electrodes, 175 accurately reached their neurophysiological target, as measured by postoperative computed tomography reconstruction and multimodal image integration with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Four electrodes failed to hit their target due to extradural deflection, and 3 were sub-sequently resited satisfactorily. Eight electrodes were off target by a mean of 3. 6 mm (range, 0. 9 - 6. 8 mm) due {{to a combination of}} errors in bolt trajectory implementation and bending of the electrode. There was 1 postoperative hemorrhage that was clinically asymptomatic and no postoperative infections. Sixteen patients were offered definitive cortical resections, and 6 patients were excluded from resective surgery. CONCLUSION: Frameless SEEG is a novel and safe method for implementing SEEG and is easily translated into clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the several}} {{machining}} processes, drilling {{is one of}} the most frequently used for the hole production for screws, rivets and <b>bolts.</b> <b>Drilling</b> of composite materials causes several damage modes, such as: delamination, fiber-pull out, edge chipping, spalling, uncut fibers, surface roughness and dimensional errors, and others. Delamination is a major problem associated with drilling fiber reinforced composite materials. It causes poor assembly tolerance, reduces structural integrity of material and the potential for long term performance deterioration. The thrust force has been cited as main cause of delamination. In this paper the objective was to establish correlation between cutting tool geometry, cutting velocity and feed rate with delamination during drilling carbon fibre reinforced composite materials.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the boom arm vertical speed for roof bolting machines {{to study a}} moving boom arm appendage at different speeds during different work scenarios. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine the impact of the appendage speed on the likelihood of the operator's hand, arm, head, or leg making contact, such as touching the moving appendage. The overall research goal is to reduce workers' risks to injury from exposure to underground mining machinery. Accident investigation reports from the Mine Safety and Health Administration do not usually contain enough information to aid in studying this problem, and lab experiments with human subjects are not feasible because of safety issues. As an alternative, researchers used a unique computer simulation model that uses a virtual human, vision tracking, and generates random virtual human motions and risky work behaviors. By using specialized software to simulate the computer model, researchers accurately identified potential hazards of tasks where it is not possible to perform experiments with human subjects. Results of a frequency distribution analytic approach show that, regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the boom was moving up, always greater on the hand, and always greater for the boom arm part of the machine. The reason why the subject experiences more contacts when the boom arm is moving up rather than down is that more risky behaviors occur during <b>drilling</b> and <b>bolting</b> when the boom is ascending. Results of a cross-tabulation analytic approach show that the 25 th- percentile operators experienced more contacts than other operator sizes and had most of their contacts during a boom speed of 13 in/sec. The hand-on-boom behavior during <b>drilling</b> and <b>bolting</b> tasks experienced more contacts than other work behaviors, and both tasks had most of their contacts during speed 13 in/sec. The 60 -in seam experienced more contacts than other seam heights and had most of the contacts during speed 16 in/sec. For univariate logistic regression models, seam height is the most important predictor of the probability of a contact. However, a multivariate logistic regression model predicted contacts are more likely with the both-knee work posture in the 60 -in seam, a 25 th-percentile operator compared to a 55 th-percentile operator, and speeds 16 and 22 in/sec compared to 7 in/sec. Results of a survival analytic approach suggest that controlling the boom speed is the most important factor in determining the risk of an operator making contact. Based on the data collected, boom speeds greater than 13 in/sec result in a substantial increase in risk to the roof bolter operator making contact. Speeds less than or equal to 13 in/sec are associated with a more modest relative risk of making contact, which represents a decrease in potential hazard. Virtual operator's response time has little effect on the number of contacts experienced. The mining industry can use the information in this study to reduce the likelihood that roof bolter operators will experience injury due to contact with a moving roof bolting machine's boom arm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper, therefore, {{is to find out}} whether in the course of task performances, miners engage in {{activities}} influenced by their tacit knowledge to enhance the quality of the maintenance process for high technology equipment in deep mines. Guided by an organizational activity theoretical framework, data was collected by observing and interviewing four different mineworkers engaged in rock <b>drilling</b> and roof <b>bolting</b> activities in an underground mine. An interpretive descriptive analysis was conducted to understand the mineworkers activities when engaged with their work. It is found that the miners use their acquired experiences to find ways of maintaining and managing the machines they use for optimum work performance. It is concluded that an employee’s tacit knowledge, when made visible, can help determine the horizon of possible actions that can influence either positively or otherwise on the maintenance process Godkänd; 2011; 20111214 (mohami) </p...|$|R
