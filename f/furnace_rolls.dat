40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the <b>furnace</b> <b>rolls</b> with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|E
50|$|The {{plant was}} an {{integrated}} steel mill. Raw materials were shipped in by rail, processed into steel and steel products, and then reshipped by rail and truck to their final market. The plant, {{in addition to}} having all of the facilities for primary steel making, included on-site conversion of coal into coke, plus other facilities for post-processing of coal byproducts, including production of inorganic fertilizers. Blast furnaces converted raw iron ores into pig iron, and final conversion into steel was via open hearth <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Rolling</b> mill facilities for forming steel into plate, pipe, and some structural shapes were also located there.|$|R

This paper for the first time proposed the self-centering ability of tapered hearth roll on initial flatness of strip travelling in the furnace and a FEM model that coupling the strip and <b>furnace</b> <b>roll</b> is constructed to simulate the traveling process of strip in the furnace. The self-centering ability is quite different with respect to the different initial flatness waves of strip traveling in the furnace and can be used for optimization of initial flatness of strip for stability improvement...|$|R

60|$|Who shall {{tell what}} did befall, Far away in time, when once, Over the lifeless ball, Hung idle stars and suns? What god the element obeyed? Wings of what wind the lichen bore, Wafting the puny seeds of power, Which, lodged in rock, the rock abrade? And well the primal pioneer Knew the strong task to it assigned, Patient through Heaven's {{enormous}} year To build in matter home for mind. From air the creeping centuries drew The matted thicket low and wide, This must {{the leaves of}} ages strew The granite slab to clothe and hide, Ere wheat can wave its golden pride. What smiths, and in what <b>furnace,</b> <b>rolled</b> (In dizzy aeons dim and mute The reeling brain can ill compute) Copper and iron, lead and gold? What oldest star the fame can save Of races perishing to pave The planet with a floor of lime? Dust is their pyramid and mole: Who saw what ferns and palms were pressed Under the tumbling mountain's breast, In the safe herbal of the coal? But when the quarried means were piled, All is waste and worthless, till Arrives the wise selecting will, And, out of slime and chaos, Wit Draws the threads of fair and fit. Then temples rose, and towns, and marts, The shop of toil, the hall of arts; Then flew the sail across the seas To feed the North from tropic trees; The storm-wind wove, the torrent span, Where they were bid, the rivers ran; New slaves fulfilled the poet's dream, Galvanic wire, strong-shouldered steam. Then docks were built, and crops were stored, And ingots added to the hoard. But though light-headed man forget, Remembering Matter pays her debt: Still, through her motes and masses, draw Electric thrills and ties of law, Which bind the strengths of Nature wild To the conscience of a child.|$|R

40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{and texture}} evolution of cold rolled low stacking fault energy fcc Fe- 30 Mn- 3 Al- 3 Si alloy was investigated {{as a function}} of the cold rolling strain. The alloy was melted and cast in a vacuum induction <b>furnace,</b> hot <b>rolled</b> and annealed before being cold rolled at three different strains: epsilon = 0. 035, epsilon = 0. 2 and epsilon = 1. 2. During the cold rolling process different deformation mechanisms became active depending on the strain. At low strain levels, epsilon = 0. 035 and epsilon = 0. 2, slip traces were observed whereas at higher strains shear bands appeared. The brass orientation { 110 } spreading towards the Goss orientation it { 101 } was dominant at every strain level. The intensity of these texture components increased with increasing rolling strain. The increase of the brass component was more, pronounced when epsilon varied from 0. 035 to 0. 2, whereas the increase of the Goss component was more pronounced when epsilon varied from 0. 2 to 1. 2. Additional texture components developed: the epsilon orientation it { 111 } lying on the gamma-fibre and the S orientation { 123 } lying on the beta-fibre. This evolution is comparable to other low SFE fcc materials exhibiting the brass-type texture. status: publishe...|$|R
