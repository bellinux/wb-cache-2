5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source {{of this type of}} tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets.

The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E

5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands. The breeding population had begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced {{suitability}} of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This bird is good eating; when they were common in England, Mrs Beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer. More significant than direct hunting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> many birds, up to 14,000 a year, in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nests and chicks from early mowing.

Nuclear β-catenin apparently can directly, transcriptionally activate EMT-associated target genes, such as the E-cadherin gene repressor SLUG (also known as SNAI2). Mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, can contribute to CSC survival and metastatic potential through stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors through interactions with ROS (reactive oxygen species).|$|E
