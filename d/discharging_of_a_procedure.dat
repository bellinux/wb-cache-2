This statute has {{completely}} reformed bankruptcy {{law in the}} Czech Republic including {{but not limited to}} by implementation of new legal institute <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debtor. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debtor is designed to be <b>a</b> mode <b>of</b> solution of consumer's bankruptcy for non-business individuals and non-business legal entities. Being modeled by foreign legal forms this institute has acknowledged a relief from debts and hence new start for economic life of the subject. New form of solution of consumer's bankruptcy has proven its need of existence also by the fact that <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debtor {{is by far the most}} frequent mode of bankruptcy solution in the Czech Republic.

The thesis text itself is divided into six chapters.

40|$|Background: It is {{sometimes}} difficult {{to decide on}} <b>a</b> safe <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acute asthmatic patient from the emergency room (ER). Objective: To develop a predictive score for safe <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acute asthmatic patient from the ER. Material and Method: All adult asthmatic patients who visited the ER at Ramathibodi Hospital from January 2004 to August 2005 were recruited. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and severity factors were recorded. Salbutamol was nebulized initially and repeatedly if the peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) were 2 predicted an unfavorable outcome. Conclusion: A predictive score based on three bedside parameters might be used for <b>a</b> safe <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> asthma patients from the ER...|$|R
40|$|Prediction <b>of</b> maximum <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{debris flow}} is as {{essential}} {{for the design of}} hard counter-measures as for the planning of soft countermeasures. Although the senior author has presenteda formula predicting the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debris flow generated from rather uniform sediment bed,the one which predicts the discharge due to failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural dam has not been available yet. This paper presents two discharge predicting forumlae, the one is applicable to the case inwhich overspilled water flow scours the dam-body, and the other is applicable to the case in whichthe collapse of the dam-body occurs by the effect <b>of</b> seepage flow. <b>A</b> method to classify the twocases is also proposed. The <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debris flow which occurred in the basin of the Kizuriver is well explained by the latter discharge predicting formula. This formula would be alsoapplicable to a debris flow which originates from a moving earth block accelerated by a landslide...|$|R
