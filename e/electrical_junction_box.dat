5000|$|In the 1920s, in {{the hills}} above the development, a large sign spelled out [...] "Outpost" [...] in red neon letters 30 feet high. It was {{intended}} {{to compete with the}} Hollywoodland sign, (which later became the Hollywood sign. At the time, it was the largest neon sign in the United States. The Outpost sign was dismantled during World War II, and the wreckage of the sign was left in place, buried in the weeds. Even the original foundation and <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> survived. The twisted remains were identified by hikers in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The 2009 {{breakdown}} {{was caused}} by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called [...] "a perfect storm" [...] of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant. But the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's [...] "wet well" [...] from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, {{only one of the}} four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> <b>boxes</b> placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.|$|R

Outdated <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> transformers, wiring, and conduits were replaced. [...] Many of these devices are from the star's original 1949 construction. The upgrades cost $100,000. The work is expected to save the city more money in the long run due to a reduced need for maintenance.|$|R

50|$|A typical {{ceiling fan}} weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many {{junction}} boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan in operation exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object {{from which it}} is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the National Electric Code (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.|$|E
50|$|The ball turret {{has been}} {{restored}} and a machine gun (with new ammo box) mounted {{in one of the}} waist gunner positions. New gun barrels were fabricated and added to the tail and chin positions and a fully refurbished, modified top turret has been installed. Both the ball turret and top turret can be manually operated. New signage (part of an Eagle Scout project) directs visitor attention to, and provides information about, various features of the aircraft. Crew station equipment, particularly in the radio compartment and tail gunner positions are being restored, replaced with new surplus items, or if necessary, fabricated in preparation for reinstallation when structural repairs are completed in those positions. The tail cone has been removed and structural repairs in it are nearing completion after the tedious task of stripping all old paint was completed. The same is true of the radio compartment where structural repairs are underway following the laborious task of stripping paint. All equipment from the nose has been removed from the aircraft. Stripping paint from the nose and performing much needed repairs there will follow completion of the tail gunner and radio operator positions. Wooden components have been rebuilt or refabricated, including the floor in the waist, an <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> in the bomb bay, two ammo boxes (the first two of several), the tail gunner seat, the radio operator’s desk (using mostly original wooden components), and the navigator’s desk with the restoration and re-fabrication of interior wooden doors is still in progress. All props have been stripped and prepared for painting plus the tail wheel assembly and main landing gear have been cleaned and repainted. Restoration of peripheral equipment such as bombs and bomb carts is also nearing completion.|$|E
5000|$|Acquisitions continued. In January 1963, Midland-Ross {{acquired}} the J. Leukart Machine Company of Columbus, Ohio, manufacturer of precision machining equipment. In April, it {{acquired the}} Steel City Electric Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{a manufacturer of}} <b>electrical</b> cables, <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> and other industrial electrical equipment. That same year, it changed the name of its Midland Brake division to Power Controls. The company had significantly diversified its product line, and now primarily manufactured air and vacuum brake systems, air compressors, brake valves, treadles, and slack adjustors. By 1965, Midland-Ross' sales had risen to a record $210 million ($ in [...] dollars). In February of that year, it acquired National Malleable and Steel Castings Co. (a company which made grinding balls, iron and steel castings, and railway equipment) for $30 million ($ in [...] dollars). The purchase included two subsidiaries, Industrial Castings (an iron and steel casting manufacturer) and Capitol Foundry (maker of steel grinding balls for the mining industry).|$|R

40|$|The {{major fire}} and fire injury {{findings}} for all metal/nonmetal mining categories for 1990 - 2001 {{are shown in}} tables 64 - 65. Table 66, partly illustrated in figure 22, shows the number of fires, fire injuries, fire fatalities, risk rates, employees' working hours, and lost workdays for all metal/nonmetal mining categories by time period. For all metal/nonmetal operations (including stone and sand and gravel), a total of 518 fires occurred during 1990 - 2001; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities (Ewhr = 4, 012 x 106 hr, In = 0. 015, LWD = 36, 204). Thirty fires and 26 injuries involved contractors. The greatest number of fires and fire injuries occurred at surface operations; the highest risk rate values were also calculated for surface operations. The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), hydraulic fluid/fuel sprayed onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries). The flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame source caused fires usually involving welders' clothing or oxyfuel/grease and other materials (including chute and dust collector liners, flammable liquids, belt material, crusher, hopper and shaker deck materials, washer plants, equipment mechanical components, stampler breaker, hydraulic fluid, rubber tires and hoses, gear boxes, bin feeder, dump rope cables, screen liner and screen panel, kiln and shaft material, pipelines, liquor pumps, wood pallets, <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> <b>boxes,</b> handrails, grease, refuse, shop and wood). The spontaneous combustion/hot material and electrical fires were usually detected late due to lack of combustion gas/smoke detection systems. At least 55 of the 89 mobile equipment hydraulic fluid/fuel fires became large fires (requiring 12 mine rescue team interventions in undergroun...|$|R

50|$|There {{was also}} a <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> called the Korg PS-3050, which was for {{controlling}} up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by routing a PS-3001 cable from the keyboard to the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and then routing separate cables from the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose the}} concept of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> in a junctionless (JL) field-effect-transistor (FET) to {{illustrate}} the transfer characteristics of the JL FET. In this work, nanowire (NW) junctionless poly-Si thin-film transistors are used to demonstrate this conception of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction.</b> Though the dopant and the dosage of the source, of the drain, and of the channel are exactly the same in the JL FET, the transfer characteristics of the JL FET is similar to these of the conventional inversion-mode FET rather than these of a resistor, which is because of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> at the boundary of the gate and the drain in the JL FET. The <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> helps us to understand the JL FET, and also to explain the superior transfer characteristic of the JL FET with the gated raised S/D (Gout structure) which reveals low drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) and low breakdown voltage of ion impact ionization...|$|R
