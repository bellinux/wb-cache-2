Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E
5|$|The voyage {{taught the}} Navy more fueling {{stations}} were needed around the world, and the strategic {{potential of the}} Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914.

A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came {{under the rule of}} King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E

5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand.

There were 204 cases of femoral-popliteal artery by-pass procedures utilizing vein grafts. In 193 cases, this procedure was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. The remainder of the cases consisted of arm veins, bank veins and superficial femoral veins. There were 149 femoral-tibial or popliteal-tibial artery bypasses utilizing vein grafts or composite grafts.

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it <b>did</b> <b>with</b> France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
5|$|On 24 May Ibrahim Pasha {{departed}} from Jaffa with 9,000 soldiers and began his march toward recapturing Jerusalem. The next day, thousands of rebels {{left the city}} to harry Ibrahim Pasha's forces on their route. A trip that would have normally taken five hours lasted two days as rebels attacked Egyptian troops, inflicting some 1,500 casualties, including at least 500 fatalities. When Ibrahim Pasha reached Jerusalem, he did not enter the city immediately and instead stationed his forces at his headquarters in Mount Zion, which overlooked Jerusalem. On 28 May, he offered an amnesty to any rebel who surrendered, but none <b>did.</b> <b>With</b> 3,000 soldiers he personally commanded a pursuit of rebels inside the city, resulting {{in the deaths of}} about 300 rebels and the capture of some 500. Most were promptly released, but seventeen were jailed.|$|E

5|$|On late June, Louis XIV {{replaced}} Noailles for Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme. Noailles charged Saint-Sylvestre of incompetence and, as <b>did</b> <b>with</b> {{other high}} officers, of looting {{the country on}} his own benefit, which had put on arms the peasantry against the French army. On 8 July Vendôme led his troops before Castellfollit. Having expelled its population and eaten horses and mules, the French garrison, diminished by desertions, was in an unsustainable position, and Vendôme came to evacuate and demolish the fortress. After that, the French army took the way to Hostalric and demolished its defenses, returning to Girona on 28 July.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequence data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than it <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E

5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he <b>did</b> <b>with</b> his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist.
