30|$|For {{both types}} of hip spica, the {{connection}} between trunk and limb components was able to withstand <b>higher</b> <b>flexion</b> and extension loads compared to abduction and adduction loads (Fig.  6 a). POP cast material is strong against compression force, but weak against bending and tension forces. Since the connection across the lateral hip is usually thin (distance between medial and lateral surfaces) and broad (distance between anterior and posterior ends), it is weaker against abduction and abduction forces as compared to flexion and extension forces. These were consistent with our findings (Fig.  6 a, b). The anterior end of the connection will withstand the compression force during flexion, while the posterior end will withstand the compression force during extension. During physiological loading, we would expect <b>higher</b> loads in <b>flexion</b> and extension because parents usually try to sit or prop up their child for feeding or playing.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} three {{questions}} concerning the knee joint and total knee arthroplasty. 1. Are there parameters which can be changed to reduce bone resorption, caused by TKA, without affecting other relevant parameters? A debonded anterior flange of the femoral TKA component reduces bone resorption without jeopardizing the implant fixation. 2. Can {{the design of the}} femoral component be changed to obtain more physiological patellar kinematics? The orientation of the natural trochlea is significantly different (even opposite) to the orientation of the patella groove of an implanted femoral TKA component. The patellar kinematics are strongly correlated to the orientation of the trochlea and the groove. A more anatomical groove design is proposed. 3.

BACKGROUND: High mechanical loading has been consistently linked with medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, and is considered to {{play a central role}} in the pathogenesis of the disease. Evidence from healthy adults indicates that knee flexion kinematics may influence knee load. The purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the association between knee flexion kinematics and indicators of joint loading during walking (peak moments and vertical ground reaction force), in individuals with medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 89 participants with painful medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis completed three-dimensional walking gait analysis to measure stance phase ground reaction forces, knee joint moments, and knee flexion kinematics. FINDINGS: In stepwise regression, greater knee flexion excursion was associated with higher peak vertical ground reaction force, accounting for 10 % of its variance (B= 0. 62 [95 % CI 0. 34, 0. 89], P< 0. 001). Greater peak knee flexion was associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>flexion</b> moment, accounting for 44 % of its variance (B= 0. 12 [95 % CI 0. 09, 0. 15], P< 0. 001). No association was found between the knee adduction moment and knee flexion kinematics during walking. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that greater knee flexion is associated with higher joint loads in the sagittal plane (i. e. a <b>higher</b> peak knee <b>flexion</b> moment). However, knee flexion kinematics were not associated with the knee adduction moment - a proxy measure of medial compartment knee load. Thus, <b>high</b> knee <b>flexion</b> should be considered an undesirable gait characteristic with respect to knee load in individuals with medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis.

Further, Laprade demonstrated that forces applied by a dynamic brace were significantly larger than those applied by a static brace at <b>higher</b> <b>flexion</b> angles in PCL-deficient knees (LaPrade et al. 2015 b). Therefore, as demonstrated by Laprade in his study, our results suggest that dynamic bracing may be a better option than static braces for management of chronic PCL injuries or to protect healing ligaments following surgical reconstruction of the PCL and/or PCL and PLC. Clinical studies are needed to determine whether the effect of dynamic bracing on peak PFJ pressures will result in improved patient outcomes and/or a lower incidence of arthrosis in patients with PCL and PCL/PLC injuries.|$|R

When the extending effect of quadriceps exactly balances the flexing effect of hamstrings, the horizontal components of the two muscle forces also balance only at the critical flexion angle of 22 #{ 176 }. The calculations show that co-contraction of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles loads the anterior cruciate ligament from full extension to 22 #{ 176 }of flexion and loads the posterior cruciate at <b>higher</b> <b>flexion</b> angles.

The independent variables were various anthropometric parameters of the thigh, knee, leg, and whole body while the dependent variables, the passive elastic moments and the angular damping coefficients, were determined from experiments on seventeen males (22 - 31 years). The elastic moments were determined using an arthrograph based on a stiffness approach. The damping coefficients were measured using the small oscillation technique. Due to a number of outlying points, a robust regression analysis was adopted and twelve regression equations were generated at fixed knee angles (7 elastic, 5 damping).

40|$|A biarticulating {{two-dimensional}} {{model of}} the patellofemoral joint has been developed using geometric and force equilibrium constraints to calculate {{the orientation of the}} patella about its mediolateral axis. The equations developed from these constraints were solved using an iterative numerical procedure. The model predicts and explains the proximal rolling of the patella on the femur during flexion; it predicts transfer of contact from the trochlea to the femoral condyles at <b>high</b> knee <b>flexion</b> angles. Variation with flexion angle of the patellar mechanism angle and the patellofemoral joint reaction force magnitude agree well with published experimental results...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} design {{represented}} {{a worst-case scenario}} with regard to load transmission through the implant system over time, considering a relatively <b>high</b> degree of <b>flexion</b> (70 °) and exclusion of biological ACL healing. A further reason for the latter assumption was that no data on the mechanical strength of a healing ACL {{is available in the}} literature.|$|R
40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess and compare the effect of head and neck position on the oropharyngeal leak pressures and cuff position (employing fibreoptic view of the glottis) and ventilation scores between ProSeal LMA and the I-gel. Material and Methods. After induction of anesthesia, the supraglottic device was inserted and ventilation confirmed. The position of the head was randomly changed from neutral to flexion, extension, and lateral rotation (left). The oropharyngeal leak pressures, fibreoptic view of glottis, ventilation scores, and delivered tidal volumes and end tidal CO 2 were noted in all positions. Results. In both groups compared with neutral position, oropharyngeal leak pressures were significantly <b>higher</b> with <b>flexion</b> and lower with extension but similar with rotation of head and neck. However the oropharyngeal leak pressure was significantly higher for ProSeal LMA compared with the I-gel in all positions. Peak airway pressures were significantly <b>higher</b> with <b>flexion</b> in both groups (however this did not affect ventilation), lower with extension in ProSeal group, and comparable in I-gel group but did not change significantly with rotation of head and neck in both groups. Conclusion. Effective ventilation can be done with both ProSeal LMA and I-gel with head in all the above positions. ProSeal LMA has a better margin of safety than I-gel due to better sealing pressures except in flexion where the increase in airway pressure is more with the former. Extreme precaution should be taken in flexion position in ProSeal LMA...|$|R
