500|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to {{the rainforest}} and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico {{one of my favorite}} places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|Pinsky {{stated that}} he felt [...] "really inept" [...] when {{recording}} his dialogue. He said: [...] "Amongst my friends I'm funny. In that context of Dan Castellaneta... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was like a disaster movie, and I was that character played by Susan Hayward." [...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for {{a friend of mine}} who liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges. The episode also features Karl Wiedergott as the professor at the Springfield University.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} by British newspaper The Daily Mirror about how she would describe her music, Bareilles said, [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> piano-based pop/soul," [...] and said she listened {{to a lot of}} early soul and jazz when making the album.|$|R
5000|$|... "Describing the new music, Virgil says, “It’s {{a little}} more stripped-down and {{acoustic}} just because that’s what I {{wanted to do with}} this song. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it’s</b> a little bit deeper than some of my old stuff.” [...] The EP was recorded entirely at Oceanside Recording Studio in Aberdeen, WA. [...] "LV" [...] was officially released May 13, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{favorite}} Beach Boys records. A wonderful bass line... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>it's</b> {{probably the}} Beach Boys anthem." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{signaled}} Clarkson for a low ball on {{one side}} and when it came it was high up on the other. It struck my hand as I tried to get it, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a passed ball. You can give it to me if you want to. Clarkson told me that it slipped from his hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I did score a try, but {{not until}} two minutes from the end when we were {{trailing}} 23-12. So {{in the context of}} that particular match it had little relevance, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was of lasting value to Australian rugby in the years to come. That is because of the way it was scored. Mark Ella cross-kicked a long ball to me on the left wing. I gathered and touched down wide out. It {{was probably one of the}} early demonstrations of the partnership, the understanding between Mark and myself, which was to beat fruit on many, many occasions for Australia, Randwick and finally for Amatori in Milan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't blame you; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> {{myself in}} your place, if these ladies were not present. But you see I'm only obeying orders, I can't help myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Then Kevin (Churko, producer) heard ‘Far From Home’, {{which is}} kind of a ballad I guess, and he {{encouraged}} us to work on it some more, and today of course I’m really glad we did. We changed the structure, added some strings, and generally moved the track up to a whole new level. “Now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it’s</b> a potential single, but quite a way down the line…” ...|$|R
5000|$|Dalene Rovenstine of Paste Magazine {{rated the}} episode with 7.4/10 saying that even thought {{she finds the}} episode average, she liked it. [...] "If I had to rank this episode (which <b>I</b> do), <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it’s</b> pretty average, {{but for some reason}} I like it more than that. There isn’t {{anything}} spectacular about it: the storylines aren’t intensely intriguing, but there is just enough quality dialogue sprinkled throughout that I was happy to keep watching." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the film's special effects, Dante stated [...] "We were {{planning}} to {{use a lot of}} Stan Winston's puppets—he had made some very elaborate puppets that could do a lot of things. But in practice, we found it was much simpler and cheaper to let the CGI people do the work after we'd shot the scenes. So, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it's</b> one-third puppetry and the rest CGI in Small Soldiers, even though the original idea was to do mostly puppetry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} {{you all to}} understand," [...] she declared, [...] "that every word I said came from my heart, and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> again, and more, with the same provocation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, {{if there}} were a word to say, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> I must be on the watch, and do the best I can. At present the earth is too damp for mischief." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 2007, Peterson was {{selected}} by the Minnesota Vikings {{in the first round}} with the seventh overall pick {{in the first round of}} the 2007 NFL Draft. Peterson was the first running back selected and the first of three Oklahoma Sooners to be drafted in the 2007 NFL Draft. At a press conference during the draft, Peterson announced, [...] "My collarbone, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> 90% healed. A lot of teams know that, and I don't see it stopping me from being prepared for the season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} it to her, but to no one else. If I might advise you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>it</b> will be well for you now to take some rest. You are agitated, and--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Depp {{stated in}} a BBC radio {{interview}} on July 29, 2013 {{that he hopes}} {{to be involved with}} [...] "quieter things" [...] {{at some point in the}} near future, implying that he will retire from acting. Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say your own words, you start thinking about that as an insane option for a human being." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is not the}} point,' he retorted. 'The point is, {{that there}} is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon.' His proud heart was nearly bursting. 'And it isn't fair; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> though it were with my last breath; it isn't fair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven knows I {{should have}} filched {{it for myself}} had you not been present," [...] Terrence sighed, with a bow to her. [...] "Some day the antiquarians will decide the authorship. Personally <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> smacked of Methuselah--But as I was saying, before I was delightfully interrupted..." ...|$|E

40|$|In my preface I {{have tried}} to show what a diary is, why they might be of {{interest}} to others, why I think they are valid and should be considered as such. I have defended my diary as being worthy material for a thesis, or myself as worthy of being called a writer. (Traditionally, writing in a diary doesn't qualify one as being a writer, even though you might write millions of pages and spend your entire lives doing it.) Edited selections of my diary make up the body of the thesis. These selections are divided into four main sections which suggested themselves during editing. To summarize the diary as a whole, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> about human relationships...|$|R
5000|$|As of 2014, further {{research}} is planned where a patient's blood is replaced with a cold saline solution, and a state of [...] "profound hypothermia" [...] is then medically induced, at temperatures as low as 50 F (10 C). According to Becker, [...] "draining the blood out and rapidly cooling a person to a deep level—we {{try to do it}} every day, and it’s just doggone hard to do... But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it’s</b> very likely that the idea is correct." [...] Becker believes that long-term suspended animation, where a person is kept cold for years, will eventually be possible, although [...] "we’re quite a distance" [...] from that with current technology.|$|R

5000|$|Greg Kendall is a singer/guitarist who {{was hired}} to write the songs for the band in the film. He was {{introduced}} to Schultz by mutual friend Doug MacMillan who plays Linus Tate in the movie. He said, [...] "They were to have good songs, {{but they had to}} be believable. They couldn't be too stupid and they couldn't be too ornate." [...] Schultz supplied the titles to the songs and Kendall wrote and sang most of them. They were recorded at Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Eight of his songs appear in the film and he also composed the score. Kendall likes that [...] "there's nothing MTV about it film. <b>It's</b> naive, some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to a fault. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> a strength." ...|$|R

McNairy describes his character {{as a type of}} character who he has never played before and stated [...] "getting into that thing was definitely something I had to wrap my head around emotionally in order to play that character." [...] When asked if the character was being kept as a surprise until the film's release, McNairy said [...] "I don't know if I'd call it necessarily a surprise. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> a character that lends itself to the story being told." [...] On his thoughts on being in the film, McNairy stated [...] "Playing in that world with comic books you've been reading since you were a kid, being someone in that world, it's awesome." ...|$|R
5000|$|By 2008 The Blackwater Fever {{had gained}} {{national}} radio exposure from youth radio station Triple J, on the Home & Hosed (October) and Roots 'n' All (November) segments, {{and from that}} station's Unearthed competition for new unsigned bands. In November 2008 they released their debut studio album, Sweet Misery, where DeMarco {{had been replaced by}} Andrew Walter on drums. Sputnikmusic's Nick G felt [...] "the instruments are very well played in this. The drum pops and keeps a nice rolling beat all the way through. The guitar plays is very easy on the ears and whines and squeals to keep things interesting. If I had to pick out a flaw with this album <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> in the lyrics. They are very simple and some songs just don't have many in them." ...|$|R

[...] Despite the announcement, the band proceeded to move continue on with the Amaryllis touring cycle, touring through 2013 to complete another two year touring cycle.
