Hazardous wastes from refineries stored in lagoons are old <b>environmental</b> <b>loads.</b> One way of remediation is to extract and process this waste to an alternative fuel.

When a site attracts tourists, it sometimes induces large <b>environmental</b> <b>loads</b> {{in other parts of the}} country. For example, economic activities that are stimulated by tourism, such as shopping, eating in restaurants, and lodging, which generate relatively small <b>environmental</b> <b>loads,</b> tend to stimulate production activities in industries such as agriculture, the food industry, and manufacturing, which have larger <b>environmental</b> <b>loads.</b> Hasegawa et al.

It is also important to consider the effect of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, particularly insofar as the shift in power generation methods in Japan is concerned. The model and data obtained in our study provide a powerful tool for investigating the economic and environmental impacts of tourism.|$|R

40|$|Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Eco-indicator 99 method, a LCA {{model was}} applied to conduct {{environmental}} impact and end-of-life treatment policy analysis for secondary batteries. This model evaluated the cycle, recycle and waste treatment stages of secondary batteries. Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries and Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries were chosen as the typical secondary batteries in this study. Through this research, the following results were found: (1) A basic number of cycles should be defined. A minimum cycle number of 200 would result in an obvious decline of <b>environmental</b> <b>loads</b> for both battery types. Batteries with high energy density and long life expectancy have small <b>environmental</b> <b>loads.</b> Products and technology that help increase energy density and life expectancy should be encouraged. (2) Secondary batteries should be sorted out from municipal garbage. Meanwhile, different types of discarded batteries should be treated separately under policies and regulations. (3) The incineration rate has obvious impact on the Eco-indicator points of Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. The influence of recycle rate on Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries is more obvious. These findings indicate that recycling is the most promising direction for reducing secondary batteries’ <b>environmental</b> <b>loads.</b> The model proposed here {{can be used to}} evaluate <b>environmental</b> <b>loads</b> of other secondary batteries and it can be useful for proposing policies and countermeasures to reduce the environmental impact of secondary batteries...|$|R

40|$|Large-bore piping inside {{manifold}} {{structures are}} designed to be flexible. The piping must absorb thermal and pressure loading, as well as installation tolerances, well growth and in some cases stroking and/or other temporarily imposed displacement-controlled conditions. In order for branch pipes, flex-loops or other jumper type configurations to cope with the functional, fabrication and installation loads they {{are designed to}} be highly flexible. Depending on well conditions and functional requirements the piping is commonly highly utilised statically. Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and wave-induced loading on the other hand are directly related to the Eigen-frequencies of the piping systems, and the more flexible a system is, the more prone it is to respond to cyclic loading induced by waves and current. In order to mitigate <b>environmental</b> <b>loading</b> effects, it is favourable to heighten the harmonic frequency of a system. Increasing the harmonic frequency is however done by making the system more rigid, which generally is undesirable for flexible large-bore piping systems in manifolds, since this in turn increases the level of static utilisation. There is to DNV’s knowledge currently no standard industry practice on VIV and <b>environmental</b> <b>loading</b> for large-bore manifold piping, since these normally are sufficiently rigid to prevent VIV. Recently, however, DNV has encountered systems where VIV and <b>environmental</b> <b>loading</b> have presented significant challenges for flexible large-bore systems, and this paper proposes a series of methodologies to estimate fatigue and extreme <b>environmental</b> <b>loading</b> of such systems.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new {{tool for the}} optimization of catenary mooring systems for floating wind turbines with a semi-submersible support structure. Each source of <b>environmental</b> <b>loading</b> -wind, current and waves -is spread over a range of compass directions, based upon probability distributions determined by meteorological and oceanographic measurements. Frequency domain analysis is applied to determine the linear response of the platform. Mean forces due to wind and current are determined to ﬁnd the mean position of the platform and thereby the linearized mooring stiffness matrix. Subsequently, the stochastic loads from wind sea, ocean swell and turbulent wind are applied {{in the form of}} spectral loading matrices. The resulting mooring system design is site-speciﬁc, accounting for the directionality of <b>environmental</b> <b>loads.</b> A large number of different scenarios can be evaluated quickly and approximately. Hence the tool is useful for preliminary design of floating wind turbines. As an example application, a symmetric semi-submersible design with three columns is analyzed. Results for two sites in the North Sea, with different water depths and distinct directionality of <b>environmental</b> <b>loads,</b> are compared and indicate that spectral wind loads should be considered when designing mooring systems for floating wind turbines...|$|R

40|$|A {{main concern}} related to safety of {{offshore}} structures is the hydrodynamic loading {{of the structure}} during its expected lifetime. The safety of a fixed or floating structure is contingent on the robust design of the structure. Design of an offshore structure is usually based on a methodology in which a target component safety level is obtained by defining specific limit states and ensuring that the <b>environmental</b> <b>loads</b> do not exceed these limits. The most typical limit states are the Ultimate Limit State corresponding to the ultimate resistance of the structure for carrying loads and the Fatigue Limit State related {{to the possibility of}} failure due to the effect of cyclic loading. For each of the limit states representative loads are defined. For the ultimate limit state, the characteristic load corresponds to a load with an annual probability of exceedance equal to or less than 10 - 2. For the fatigue limit state, the characteristic load is the expected load history on the structure during its lifetime [1]. For offshore structures the main <b>environmental</b> <b>loads</b> are loads induced by waves, wind and current. Other loads can be due to earthquake, tidal effects or snow and ice.
