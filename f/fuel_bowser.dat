25|$|Phases 2 and 3 {{would be}} {{undertaken}} between 2015 and 2030. Further aircraft parking stands {{would be built}} {{to the east of}} the terminal, and a taxiway would be constructed alongside and to the south of the runway, to avoid the need for aircraft to back-track on the runway. Both these developments would involve further reduction in the water area of the King George V Dock. The existing fuel farm would be relocated to a site at the east of the airport, where it could be supplied by barge, and linked to a hydrant based supply system, thus eliminating both road tanker deliveries and on-airport <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> movements. The existing surface car park would be replaced by a multi-storey car park, allowing extension of the vehicle drop-off and pick up area. The jet centre and hangar facilities would be further extended. Finally the existing terminal building would be replaced.|$|E

50|$|Northern Cape Flying Services {{was granted}} {{permission}} {{to construct a}} hangar on 3 August 1946. The first buildings, a <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> and a telephone service followed.|$|E
50|$|Eulo has one pub {{and a small}} {{general store}} as well as Outback Petrol. The general store and <b>fuel</b> <b>bowsers</b> were {{destroyed}} by fire on 25 July 2011. It has since been rebuilt.|$|R
2500|$|Brighton City Airport's {{aircraft}} fuelling {{service is}} operated as {{a department of}} the Rescue and Firefighting Service. There are three large mobile <b>fuel</b> <b>bowsers</b> for delivering both avgas and jet fuel to aircraft, including a service (accompanied by fire appliances) for fast delivery of fuel to police and coastguard emergency helicopters without disengaging their engines. Fuel technicians {{are attached to the}} firefighting watches and work the same shift pattern ...|$|R
50|$|Special {{custom made}} trucks include firetrucks, riot control trucks, {{military}} trucks, garbage trucks and airport <b>fuel</b> <b>bowsers.</b> Several GINAF trucks also {{participate in the}} annual Dakar Rally as both rally and service trucks, having done so since 1987, though the first GINAF {{to participate in the}} rally was labelled as being a DAF for marketing purposes. The amount of GINAF trucks participating in the rally has been on the rise since Dutch driver Hans Bekx entered a newly constructed GINAF truck in 2000.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 1929 the Toodyay Road Board granted {{permission}} for a <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> {{to be installed}} out the front. It is not known when the bowser was removed.|$|E
50|$|The Stallion chassis {{has been}} adapted {{into a wide}} range of variants, including: Troop Carrier with Armoured Cab, Troop Carrier, Troop Carrier with Crane, <b>Fuel</b> <b>Bowser,</b> Water Bowser, Recovery Vehicle, ISO Container / Twist Locks, Fire Fighting Trucks, Tipper, MPV Kits.|$|E
50|$|Stuart also {{produced}} many internal combustion generators with uses such as charging aircraft batteries, and providing dummy runway lights on fake airfields. Stuart engines were {{built into the}} back of AEC <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> trucks to drive a Zwicky Ltd pump to transfer fuel to aircraft. These P5XC engines were referred to in-house as the Zwicky engines.|$|E
50|$|Sylvanus Freelove Bowser (8 August 18543 October 1938) was an American {{inventor}} who {{is widely}} credited with inventing the automobile <b>fuel</b> pump. <b>Bowser</b> Avenue {{in his hometown}} of Fort Wayne, Indiana is named after him.|$|R
50|$|VFJ {{manufactures}} and assembles {{general staff}} vehicles, logistics vehicles, light armoured vehicles like bullet-proof vehicles, mine protected vehicles and specialist role vehicles {{such as water}} <b>bowsers,</b> <b>fuel</b> tankers, field ambulances, tippers, battery command posts, generator sets, light recovery vehicles, field artillery tractors, kitchen containers etc. It also has some variants for civilian applications.|$|R
50|$|Reaching {{recently}} secured Tanapag Harbor on 17 July 1944, Yakutat began {{setting up}} a seaplane base there and immediately commenced servicing seaplanes, providing subsistence and quarters for the aviators and aircrews attached to those aircraft. She provided the aircraft with gasoline and lubricating oil via <b>bowser</b> <b>fueling</b> boats and commenced servicing planes by the over-the-stern method as well.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 November 1943, 26-year-old Barton {{was killed}} in an air crash at RAF Detling when a de Havilland Tiger Moth in which she was a {{passenger}} hit a <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> on take-off in bad weather. She was buried with military honours at the Margate Cemetery in Margate, Kent. Her friend and pilot of the Tiger Moth was Flight Lieutenant Angus Ruffhead survived the crash but {{was killed in}} action over France a few weeks later.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that {{following}} service with BP Oils GJD 121 N was in service {{in the mid to}} late 1980s with Premier Travel of Cambridge who used it as a <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser.</b> In 2006 it was being offered for sale. The body was missing and generally the vehicle appeared to be in a sorry state. But it was purchased by Michael Cooper from Ayrshire, Scotland, in 2007 and fully restored by June 2008 and a replica Derby type body was fitted. GJD 121 N was sold to McReath Taylor Ltd. in 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 the SAC {{reformed}} at Netherthorpe {{operating out}} of the former clubhouse/RAF guardroom, this would be later converted into a private residence with the current clubhouse bring built in the 1970s. In 2016 assets consisted of a clubhouse (the Skyways Bar); with a garden leading out onto the airfield, four hangars; one hangar used for aircraft maintenance and another incorporating the fire tender shed, an operations block and control tower along with a 100LL <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser.</b> During the late 1990s Phoenix Flying School was established by Dukeries Aviation Ltd {{operating out of}} the maintenance hangar. Utilising social media a Summer Fayre and Fly-in event is organised each July, throughout the year various social events are also organised at the clubhouse.|$|E

50|$|Signalled in the {{darkness}} by an arrangement similar to traffic lights, the crew awaited their turn to take off, wireless traffic was kept to an absolute minimum to avoid alerting the German wireless listening services. If {{it was to be}} a distant target the aircraft fuel tanks might be topped-up by a <b>fuel</b> <b>bowser</b> immediately before taking off. Each crew would taxi out to the runway in its pre-assigned order with the pilot checking over the intercom with each of his crew in turn that they were well and everything was working before they were signaled to take off, and with the flight engineer standing beside the pilot to help manage the throttles they would go to full power and hope to pick up sufficient speed to get about 25 tons of bomber into the air before the end of the runway. A tyre blow out, a wheel running off the runway into soft grass or an engine failure at this point would mean disaster as the 2,000 gallons (up 8 tons) of aviation fuel, approximately 5 tons of bombs (high explosive and incendiary) and multiple thousands of rounds of ammunition crashed at over 130 miles per hour. A crash at this stage usually killed all aboard. Bombers usually took off with about 60 second intervals between them. The pilot would slowly climb to the designated height and head for the group's assembly point near the coast. Once airborne every airman had to hope that his oxygen mask and supply functioned properly when it was switched on at 5,000 feet and did not suffer from icing in the frigid temperatures at high altitude, their electrically heated flying suits, boots and gloves were completely necessary to avoid frostbite throughout the year.|$|E
