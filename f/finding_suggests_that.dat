5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
25|$|This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> reassortment between {{segments}} occurs slowly enough, {{relative to}} the actions of positive selection, that genetic hitchhiking causes beneficial mutations in HA and NA to reduce diversity in linked neutral variation in other segments of the genome.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of histologically normal fields surrounding neoplastic growths (adenomas and colon cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals {{who never had}} a colonic neoplasm.

25|$|In 2006, {{molecular}} phylogenetic analysis {{confirmed that}} the African damselfly Coryphagrion grandis, previously often classified within Megapodagrionidae or in a monotypic family Coryphagrionidae, belonged within family Pseudostigmatidae, close to genus Mecistogaster, as was proposed already ten years before. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the family dates back to before {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
25|$|A skull {{found in}} Peștera cu Oase in 2004/5 bears {{features}} of both modern humans and Neanderthals. According {{to a paper}} by Erik Trinkaus and others, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in January, 2007, this <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the two groups interbred thousands of years ago. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the skull is 37,800 years old, making it amongst the oldest modern human fossils ever found in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are {{frequently}} based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein found no {{strong evidence that}} {{a particular set of}} Hapke parameters derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.|$|E

25|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Nile Quay Text No.14 (dated to Year 29 of an Usimare Setepenamun) belongs to Osorkon II on palaeographical grounds. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Osorkon II likely did celebrate his first Heb Sed in his 30th Year as was traditionally the case with other Libyan era Pharaohs such as Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In addition, a Year 22 Stela from his reign preserves no mention of any Heb Sed celebrations in this year {{as would be expected}} (see Von Beckerath, 'infra').|$|E
25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E
25|$|The human mouth {{moves in}} {{distinct}} ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use {{different parts of}} their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of babbling, infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> babbling {{is controlled by the}} left hemisphere of the brain. The larynx, or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends {{during the first year of}} life, allowing the pharynx to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like speech sounds.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} explore the feeding habits of stegosaurids, Reichel (2010) created a 3-D model of Stegosaurus teeth using the {{software}} ZBrush. The model finds that the bite forces of Stegosaurus was significantly weaker than that of Labradors, wolves and humans. The <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> these dinosaurs {{would be capable of}} breaking smaller branches and leaves with their teeth, but {{would not be able to}} bite through a thick object (12mm or more in diameter). Parrish et al.’s (2004) description of Jurassic flora in the stegosaurid-rich Morrison Formation supports this finding. The flora during this time-period was dominated by seasonal small, fast-growing herbaceous plants, which stegosaurids could consume easily if Reichel’s reconstruction is accurate.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a safety valve for stress {{conditions}} in the photosynthetic apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the plastoquinone pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a safety valve for stress conditions and that it is more important during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|LGV {{was first}} {{described}} by Wallace in 1833 and again by Durand, Nicolas, and Favre in 1913. Since the 2004 Dutch outbreak many additional {{cases have been}} reported, leading to greater surveillance. Soon after the initial Dutch report, national and international health authorities launched warning initiatives and multiple LGV cases were identified in several more European countries (Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Switzerland) and the US and Canada. All cases reported in Amsterdam and France and a considerable percentage of LGV infections in the UK and Germany were caused by a newly discovered Chlamydia variant, L2b, a.k.a. the Amsterdam variant. The L2b variant could be traced back and was isolated from anal swabs of {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who visited the STI city clinic of San Francisco in 1981. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the recent LGV outbreak among MSM in industrialised countries is a slowly evolving epidemic. The L2b serovar has also been identified in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Since {{replication}} machineries do {{not move}} relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated {{for the remainder of}} replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in budding yeast by monitoring green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.|$|E

500|$|Mating {{behavior}} {{has been studied}} in the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera. [...] Multiple paternity, common in the Malacostrica, also occurs in C. ensifera. [...] Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother. [...] This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> sperm competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs.

500|$|In August 2012, astronomers at Copenhagen University {{reported}} {{the detection of}} a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. [...] This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior {{to the formation of}} planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.|$|E
500|$|Many {{economists are}} sceptical about the {{economic}} benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such [...] "mega-events" [...] often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong {{positive effect on the}} philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This <b>finding</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.|$|E
