40|$|Genetic {{ablation}} of plasminogen (Plg) and pharmacological {{inhibition of}} metalloproteinase activity by galardin delay skin wound healing in mice, whereas the combined inhibition {{of these two}} enzyme systems completely prevents healing. In this study, the impact of plasmin and metalloproteinases as profibrinolytic enzymes has been investigated by comparing skin wound healing in the absence and presence of fibrin. Plg deficiency impairs skin wound healing kinetics, but this delay is only partially restored {{in the absence of}} fibrin. This suggests that plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis is the primary, but not the <b>exclusive,</b> <b>requirement</b> for healing of wounds in these mice. In addition, we observe that lack of fibrin reduces Plg activation significantly during wound healing. The profibrinolytic role of metalloproteinases is revealed by the finding that lack of fibrin partially restores the otherwise arrested healing of Plg-deficient wounds after metalloproteinase inhibition. In conclusion, the residual impairment of skin wound healing in the absence of fibrin suggests the existence of a fibrin-independent substrate(s) for plasmin and metalloproteinases. Furthermore, these in vivo data reveal that galardin-sensitive metalloproteinases mediate compensatory fibrinolysis to facilitate wound healing in the absence of plasmin...|$|E

By using a communication subsystem, an upper middleware library or runtime system can be more easily ported to different interconnects. By abstracting the network layer, however, the designer typically makes the communication subsystem more specialized for that particular middleware library, making it ineffective for supporting middleware for other programming models. In previous work we analyzed the requirements of various programming-model middleware and the communication subsystems that support such requirements. We found that {{although there are no}} mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirements,</b> none of the existing communication subsystems can efficiently support the programming model middleware we considered.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β (TGF-β) has {{been implicated in}} the {{maintenance}} of homeostasis in various organs, including the gastric epithelium. In particular, TGF-β-induced signaling was shown to be required for the differentiation-associated physiological apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells, but its mechanism has not been well understood. In this study, the molecular mechanism of TGF-β-induced apoptosis was analyzed in a human gastric epithelial cell line, SNU 16, as an in vitro model. Expression of Smad 7 and Bcl-XL, but not viral FLIP, was shown to prevent TGF-β-induced apoptosis, indicating an <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirement</b> of the activation of Smad signaling pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction followed by activation of caspase- 9. In addition, treatment with TGF-β induced binding of Bim, a proapoptotic Bcl- 2 homology domain 3 (BH 3) -only protein, to Bcl-XL, which {{is dependent on the}} activation of Smad, and reduction in the expression of Bim by RNA interference decreased the sensitivity to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found abnormalities in the gastric epithelium of both Bim and caspase- 9 knockout mice; these abnormalities were associated with a defect of physiological apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. These results indicate {{for the first time that}} TGF-β is involved in the physiological loss of gastric epithelial cells by activating apoptosis mediated by Smad, Bim, and caspase- 9...|$|E

The X-chromosomal Porcupine homolog gene (Porcn) encodes an evolutionary conserved member of the membrane bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) superfamily that {{has been shown to}} be required for the palmitoylation and secretion of Wnt 3 a, a mechanism that has been suggested to be conserved for all mammalian Wnt ligands. PORCN mutations in humans cause Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (FDH), a disorder causing developmental defects in heterozygous females and embryonic lethality in hemizygous males. In this study, Porcn mutant mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used to analyze the role of Porcn in mammalian embryonic development. In vitro, we show an <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirement</b> for Porcn in Wnt secreting cells and further, that any of the four Porcn isoforms is sufficient to allow for the secretion of functional Wnt 3 a. Embryos generated by aggregation of Porcn mutant ES cells with wildtype embryos fail to complete gastrulation in vivo, but remain in an epiblast-like state, similar to Wnt 3 and Gpr 177 /Wls mutants. Consistent with this phenotype, in vitro differentiated mutant ES cells fail to generate endoderm and mesoderm derivatives. Taken together, these data confirm the importance of Porcn for Wnt secretion and gastrulation and suggest that disruption of early development underlies the male lethality of human PORCN mutants...|$|E
40|$|A wave of {{celebrations}} of the Middle Ages has been expanding within and beyond Italian and European borders {{in the last}} four decades, and has been deeply involving the popular and traditional festival schedules as well as local memories. Starting {{from the end of the}} 60 's, many Tuscany towns and villages have adopted the “medieval contexts” to enhance their grip on the public, giving origin to a wide range of festival and medieval reenactments.

These proteins share approximately 80 % identity at amino acid level. The question of whether isoforms of Rab 3 are functionally redundant was the subject of this study. We used RT-PCR analysis, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and confocal microscope-based analysis of immunocytochemistry to show that rat melanotrophs contain about equal amounts of Rab 3 A and Rab 3 B transcripts as well as proteins. Therefore, these cells are a suitable model to study the subcellular distribution and the role of these paralogous isoforms in regulated exocytosis. Secretory activity of single cells was monitored with patch-clamp capacitance measurements, and the cytosol was dialyzed with a high-calcium-containing patch pipette solution. Preinjection of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides specific to Rab 3 A, but not to Rab 3 B, induced a specific blockage of calcium-dependent secretory responses, indicating an <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirement</b> for Rab 3 A in melanotroph cell-regulated secretion. Although the injection of purified Rab 3 B protein was ineffective, the injection of recombinant Rab 3 A proteins into rat melanotrophs revealed that regulated secretion was stimulated by a GTP-bound Rab 3 A with an intact COOH terminus and inhibited by Rab 3 AT 36 N, impaired in GTP binding. These results indicate that Rab 3 A, but not Rab 3 B, enhances secretory output from rat melanotrophs and that their function is not redundant...|$|E
40|$|The Arabidopsis genes EDS 1 and NDR 1 {{were shown}} {{previously}} by mutational analysis to encode essential components of race-specific disease resistance. Here, {{we examined the}} relative requirements for EDS 1 and NDR 1 by {{a broad spectrum of}} Resistance (R) genes present in three Arabidopsis accessions (Columbia, Landsberg-erecta, and Wassilewskija). We show that there is a strong requirement for EDS 1 by a subset of R loci (RPP 2, RPP 4, RPP 5, RPP 21, and RPS 4), conferring resistance to the biotrophic oomycete Peronospora parasitica, and to Pseudomonas bacteria expressing the avirulence gene avrRps 4. The requirement for NDR 1 by these EDS 1 -dependent R loci is either weak or not measurable. Conversely, three NDR 1 -dependent R loci, RPS 2, RPM 1, and RPS 5, operate independently of EDS 1. Another RPP locus, RPP 8, exhibits no strong <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirement</b> for EDS 1 or NDR 1 in isolate-specific resistance to P. parasitica, although resistance is compromised weakly by eds 1. Similarly, resistance conditioned by two EDS 1 -dependent RPP genes, RPP 4 and RPP 5, is impaired partially by ndr 1, implicating a degree of pathway cross-talk. Our results provide compelling evidence for the preferential utilization of either signaling component by particular R genes and thus define at least two disease resistance pathways. The data also suggest that strong dependence on EDS 1 or NDR 1 is governed by R protein structural type rather than pathogen class...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC), {{which are}} {{essential}} for inducing and regulating immune defenses and responses, represent the critical target for vaccines against pathogens such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Although {{it is clear that}} FMDV enters epithelial cells via integrins, little is known about FMDV interaction with DC. Accordingly, DC internalization of FMDV antigen was analyzed by comparing vaccine virus dominated by heparan sulfate (HS) -binding variants with FMDV lacking HS-binding capacity. The internalization was most efficient with the HS-binding virus, employing diverse endocytic pathways. Moreover, internalization relied primarily on HS binding. Uptake of non-HS-binding virus by DC was considerably less efficient, so much so that it was often difficult to detect virus interacting with the DC. The HS-binding FMDV replicated in DC, albeit transiently, which was demonstrable by its sensitivity to cycloheximide treatment and the short duration of infectious virus production. There was no evidence that the non-HS-binding virus replicated in the DC. These observations on virus replication may be explained by the activities of viral RNA in the DC. When DC were transfected with infectious RNA, only 1 % of the translated viral proteins were detected. Nevertheless, the transfected cells, and DC which had internalized live virus, did present antigen to lymphocytes, inducing an FMDV-specific immunoglobulin G response. These results demonstrate that DC internalization of FMDV is most efficient for vaccine virus with HS-binding capacity, but HS binding is not an <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirement.</b> Both non-HS-binding virus and infectious RNA interacting with DC induce specific immune responses, albeit less efficiently than HS-binding virus...|$|E

40|$|Yeast prions are {{heritable}} amyloid aggregates {{of functional}} yeast proteins; their propagation to subsequent cell generations {{is dependent upon}} fragmentation of prion protein aggregates by molecular chaperone proteins. Mounting evidence indicates the J-protein Sis 1 may act as an amyloid specificity factor, recognizing prion and other amyloid aggregates and enabling Ssa and Hsp 104 to act in prion fragmentation. Chaperone interactions with prions, however, can be affected by variations in amyloid-core structure resulting in distinct prion variants or ‘strains’. Our genetic analysis revealed that Sis 1 domain requirements by distinct variants of [PSI+] are strongly dependent upon overall variant stability. Notably, multiple strong [PSI+] variants can be maintained by a minimal construct of Sis 1 consisting of only the J-domain and glycine/ phenylalanine-rich (G/F) region that was previously shown to be sufficient for cell viability and [RNQ+] prion propagation. In contrast, weak [PSI+] variants are lost under the same conditions but maintained by the expression of an Sis 1 construct that lacks only the G/F region and cannot support [RNQ+] propagation, revealing mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirements</b> for Sis 1 function between these two prions. Prion loss is not due to [PSI+]-dependent toxicity or dependent upon a particular yeast genetic background.

40|$|Ultrasonic Force Microscopy, or UFM, allows {{combination}} of two apparently mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirements</b> for the nanomechanical probe—high stiffness for the efficient indentation and high mechanical compliance that brings force sensitivity. Somewhat inventively, UFM allows to combine these two virtues in the same cantilever by using indention of the sample at high frequency, when cantilever is very rigid, but detecting {{the result of this}} indention at much lower frequency. That is made possible due to the extreme nonlinearity of the nanoscale tip-surface junction force-distance dependence, that acts as “mechanical diode” detecting ultrasound in AFM. After introducing UFM principles, we discuss features of experimental UFM implementation, and the theory of contrast in this mode, progressing to quantitative measurements of contact stiffness. A variety of UFM applications ranging from semiconductor quantum nanostructures, very large scale integrated circuits, and reinforced ceramics to polymer composites and biological materials is presented via comprehensive imaging gallery accompanied by the guidance for the optimal UFM measurements of these materials. We also address effects of adhesion and topography on the elasticity imaging and the approaches for reducing artefacts connected with these effects. This is complemented by another extremely useful feature of UFM ultrasound induced superlubricity that allows damage free imaging of materials ranging from stiff solid state devices and graphene to biological materials.

A fundamental element in radio communications is time and frequency control, which in turn is achieved by high performance electro-acoustic components made on piezoelectric single crystalline substrates. The latter, however, reach their practical limits in terms of performance and cost as the frequency of operation reaches the microwave range. Thus, the thin film electro-acoustic technology, which uses thin piezoelectric films instead, has been recently developed to alleviate these deficiencies. This thesis explores and addresses a number of issues related to thin film synthesis on the one hand as well as component design and fabrication on other. Specifically, the growth of highly c-axis textured AlN thin films has been studied and optimized for achieving high device performance. Perhaps, one of the biggest achievements of the work is the development of a unique process for the deposition of AlN films with a mean c-axis tilt, which is of vital importance for the fabrication of resonators operating in contact with liquids, i. e. biochemical sensors. This opens the way for the development of a whole range of sensors and bio-analytical tools. Further, high frequency Lamb wave resonators have been designed, fabricated and evaluated. Performance enhancement of FBAR devices is also addressed, e. g. spurious mode suppression, temperature compensation, etc. It has been demonstrated, that even without temperature compensation, shear mode resonators operating in a liquid still exhibit an excellent performance in terms of Q (200) and coupling (~ 1. 8 %) at 1. 2 GHz, resulting in a mass resolution better than 2 ng cm- 2 in water, which excels that of today’s quartz sensors...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{problems}} solving methodologies like brainstorming, synectics, {{trial and}} error, etc. find their limits {{when they are}} facing inventive problems or problems that could be described like contradictions. A contradiction exists when two different and mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>requirements,</b> states or conditions in a system, have to be present and act together, with the aim to accomplish same objectives. Trade off is usually the most used way to solve this kind of problem, also characterized by a random search of solutions. These situations {{have a negative impact}} over performance, which could be improved by applying other methodologies and tools. The theory of inventive problem solving or TRIZ theory has the capacity to eliminate these negative aspects described above and to produce innovative solutions to contradictions. This approach, which is different from the traditional psychology based approaches, is knowledge based. The particular vision of TRIZ is based on the history of technological evolution. TRIZ considers innovation like a process which can be controlled and deployed systematically. Paradoxically, this knowledge based approach with transversal domain application, does not have the capacity to memorise, which is fundamental for learning. Consequently, knowledge that has been employed and created while solving inventive problems can not be reused. This drawback has a negative effect on problem solving performance while deploying TRIZ. Knowledge management has developed the capacity to identify, store and reuse knowledge. This is the core capacity of several knowledge management methodologies, among them is, the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The performance of this problem solving tool, lies essentially in its capacity to offer a pragmatic answer for specific domain problems. CBR systems solve a new problem by identifying its similarity to one or several previously solved problems stored in a memory and by adapting their known solutions. Since CBR application is domain specific, CBR cannot consider the solutions that have already been identified in others domains while solving new problems. This characteristic limits the CBR's capacity to propose innovative solutions to a problem. Besides, a shortcoming is revealed when a CBR system faces a problem that had not been solved in the past. If this situation occurs, the memory cannot find a similar problem and consequently, no solution is proposed. The limits and the complementarity observed between TRIZ and CBR are employed to propose a new model. This model presents an approach that combines the technological vision of TRIZ and the ability developed by CBR to memorize and to reuse knowledge. This synergy allows in the fist place, to steer the creative effort when facing inventive problems and in the second, to reuse knowledge that had been acquired in past problems. The capability of this new approach is illustrated by its application in process engineering and industrial engineeringTOULOUSE-ENSIACET (315552325) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{areas were}} {{analyzed}} and identified as high priority for more in-depth analysis. These areas were: (1) rectenna constructability; (2) satellite constructability; (3) support systems constructability; (4) space environmental analysis, and (5) special end-to-end analyses. Baseline requirements specified coplanar solar blankets {{and an end}} mounted antenna, utilizing either GaAlAs solar cells and employing a CR of 2, or Si cells. Several configurations were analyzed. Utilizing the preferred configuration as a baseline, a satellite construction base was defined, precursor operations incident to establishment of orbital support facilities identified, and the satellite construction sequence and procedures developed. Since the baseline specifies sixty instead of one hundred and twenty satellites to be constructed in a thirty year period, mass flow to orbit requirements were revised and new traffic models established. Launch site <b>requirements</b> (<b>exclusive</b> of actual launch operations) in terms of manpower and building space were defined...|$|R
