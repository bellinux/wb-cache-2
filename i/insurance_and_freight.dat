6000|$|The {{quantity}} {{of gold in}} the English pound is equivalent to [...] $4.8666+ of our gold coins. If the bills offered are about equal [...] to those wanted, a claim to a pound in England will sell for [...] $4.86. If many are wanted, and but few to be had, their price will [...] go up, of course; {{but it can not}} go more than a small fraction [...] beyond $4.90, since about 3-¼ cents is sufficient to cover the [...] brokerage, <b>insurance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> per pound sterling in a shipment [...] of gold to London. Therefore, in order to get money to a creditor [...] in London, no one will pay more for a pound {{in the form of a}} bill [...] than he will be obliged to pay for sending it across in the form [...] of bullion. Bills of exchange, then, can not rise in price beyond [...] the point ($4.90 +) since, rather than pay a higher sum for a [...] bill, gold will be sent. This point is called the “shipping-point” [...] of gold. When the exchanges are at $4.90, it will be found that [...] gold is going abroad. On the other hand, when the supply of bills [...] is greater than the demand, their price will fall. A man having a [...] bill on London to sell—i.e., a claim to a pound in London—will not [...] sell it at a price here lower than $4.86, by more than the expense [...] of bringing the gold itself across. Since this expense is about [...] 3-¼ cents, bills can not fall below about $4.83. When exchange is [...] at that price, it will be found that gold is coming to the United [...] States from England. This price is the “shipping-point” for [...] imports of gold. This, of course, applies to sight-bills only.|$|E

5000|$|Adding net {{exports of}} {{services}} and net transfers to the merchandise trade balance, with imports measured free on board (f.o.b.), rather than as customs, <b>insurance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> (c.i.f.), gives the balance on current account. Movements in Japan's current account balance have generally mirrored those of the merchandise trade balance considered earlier, although deficits in services and net transfers have offset the surpluses somewhat. Japan began to register surpluses in the current account in 1965, which later continued to rise, although they were punctuated by short-term deficits following the two oil price hikes in 1973 and 1979 (cf. 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis).|$|E
50|$|International freight forwarders, NVOCCs {{and customs}} brokers often charge for {{transferring}} documents to another transportation company at destination. This fee {{is a part}} of the ocean freight charges, being paid by the importer at the port of discharge in the International Commercial Term (incoterm) FOB (free on board), and by the exporter at the origin in the incoterms CFR (cost and freight) and CIF (cost, <b>insurance</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight).</b> This fee is separate from documentation fees charged by carriers and NVOCCs as part of the freight charges on a bill of lading and is separate from other fees for document preparation or for release of cargo. Some companies call this an administration fee, document fee, document transfer fee, but it exists in some form in most destinations and is well known to most shippers. Steamship carriers do not have this fee.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of a Colonial Surplus may be evidenced by an export surplus {{on the part of}} the colony that was outstandingly large. The export surplus must be particularly large for it has to pay real expenses such as <b>insurance</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> of the goods exported which may not be part of the colonial surplus. But it is better if there is a Balance of Payments account for the colony. Better still if this can be supported by statistics from the Balance of Payments or National Income for the metropolis or from other overseas accounts. It need not be supposed that those records of colonial exploitation are especially accurate for accountancy was in its infancy and there will be errors, omissions and downright evasions in them. Nonetheless used critically they should be enough to determine the size of the Colonial Surplus, if any.|$|E

50|$|No direct {{taxation}} is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives {{the majority of}} its income from in{{direct taxation}}. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, <b>insurance</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight)</b> and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$37.50 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket. There are no taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, or personal income. There are no estate or death inheritance taxes payable on Cayman Islands real estate or other assets held in the Cayman Islands.|$|E
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, <b>insurance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|E
