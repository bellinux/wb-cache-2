40|$|A current {{trend in}} {{spectrum}} regulation is to incorporate spectrum sharing through {{the design of}} spectrum access rules that support Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). This paper develops a decision-theoretic framework for regulators to assess the impacts of different decision rules on both primary and secondary operators.

Our results show that receiver-only sensing provides insufficient protection for primary and co-existing secondary users and overall low social welfare. On the other hand, using sensing information between the transmitter and receiver of a communication link, provides dramatic increases in system performance. The performance of using these link end points is relatively close to that of using many cooperative sensing nodes associated to the same access point and large link <b>exclusion</b> <b>areas.</b> These results are useful to regulators and network developers in understanding in developing rules for future DSA regulation...|$|R

500|$|In July 1943, Groves {{prepared}} to issue Public Proclamation No. 2, declaring the site a military <b>exclusion</b> <b>area.</b> He asked Marshall {{to present it}} to the Governor of Tennessee, Prentice Cooper. Marshall, in turn, delegated the task to the area engineer, Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, who sent a junior officer, Captain George B. Leonard. Cooper was unimpressed; he told Leonard {{that he had not}} been informed about the purpose of the CEW, and that the Army had kicked the farmers off their land and had not compensated the counties for the roads and bridges, which would now be closed. In his opinion it was [...] "an experiment in socialism", a New Deal project being undertaken {{in the name of the}} war effort. Instead of reading the proclamation, he tore it up and threw it in a waste paper basket. Marshall went to Nashville to apologize to Cooper, who refused to talk to him. Nichols, who succeeded Marshall as chief engineer of the Manhattan District, met Cooper on 31 July, and offered compensation in the form of Federal financing for road improvements. Cooper accepted an offer from Nichols to visit the CEW, which he did on 3 November.|$|E

On 29 September 1942, United States Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson authorized the Corps of Engineers to acquire [...] of land by eminent domain at a cost of $3.5million. An additional [...] was subsequently acquired. About 1,000 families were affected by the condemnation order, which came into effect on 7 October. Protests, legal appeals, and a 1943 Congressional inquiry were to no avail. By mid-November U.S. Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in. Some families were given two weeks' notice to vacate farms that had been their homes for generations; others had settled there after being evicted {{to make way for the}} Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1920s or the Norris Dam in the 1930s. The ultimate cost of land acquisition in the area, which was not completed until March 1945, was only about $2.6million, which worked out to around $47 an acre. When presented with Public Proclamation Number Two, which declared Oak Ridge a total <b>exclusion</b> <b>area</b> that no one could enter without military permission, the Governor of Tennessee, Prentice Cooper, angrily tore it up.|$|E

40|$|Cover {{crops are}} an {{effective}} means to reduce soil erosion and to provide food and shelter for wildlife. However, in areas of intensive farming, which are characterised by the scarcity of weed communities, wild herbivores may focus their grazing on cover crops, which could make their implementation difficult. In this work, we test whether rabbit grazing can prevent the growth of herbaceous cover crops in olive groves in Southern Spain in addition to assessing the role of rabbit abundance and diversity of weeds {{in the development of}} cover crops. This question has been addressed by sowing Bromus rubens between the rows of five olive groves in Cordoba province (Spain). We then monitored the surface covered by B. rubens, along with both diversity of weed communities and rabbit abundance. Two rabbit <b>exclusion</b> <b>areas</b> were also placed in each olive grove in order {{to assess the impact of}} rabbits on the development of cover crops. Our results showed that the surface occupied by B. rubens was considerably higher in the rabbit <b>exclusion</b> <b>areas</b> (mean 56. 8 ± 5. 65 %) than in those areas in which they could feed (mean 35. 6 ± 4. 32 %). The coverage occupied by cover crops was higher in areas with lower rabbit density, although this relationship was modulated by the weed diversity index, since in areas with the same rabbit abundance the coverage was higher in those with a richer weed community. These findings suggest that high rabbit abundances can prevent the development of herbaceous cover crops in olive groves, particularly in areas in which alternative food resources (measured as weed diversity) are scarce...|$|R

Moreover, the coverage in the macrocell tier can be also increased in comparison with a macrocell-only network if the number of femtocells deployed is judiciously selected. Furthermore, a well balanced network can be achieved, where the same performance is expected throughout the entire area...|$|R
