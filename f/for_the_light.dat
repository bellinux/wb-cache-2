5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground {{section in the}} city center. Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network {{was close to the}} current long-term plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail system, and consisted of three branches from the city center to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E
5|$|Etna {{frequently}} cruised abroad {{throughout her}} career, including {{visits to the}} United States for the World's Columbian Exposition and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1893 and 1909, respectively.

By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Etna had been withdrawn from service and was employed as a headquarters ship for {{the commander of the}} Italian fleet at Taranto and later <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> forces based at Brindisi. The old cruiser was finally sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E

5|$|From 1 to 31 May 1924, the Royal Air Force {{conducted}} {{a number of}} night flying experiments. Pilots were asked to keep an extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place. On 27 and 28 September, the elimination trials <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Aircraft Trials were held. Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper. Also in October, it was notified that changes were being made expanding weather information given at Lympne. Amongst the changes were that measurements used were to be changed from imperial to metric. The addition of weather information at Haren, Brussels and Ostend, both in Belgium was notified. In 1924, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross-channel services for Imperial Airways. Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point. The first stop in France was St Inglevert. When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the Coastguard was informed. Communication was by Carmichael Microway UHF transmitters at each airfield. Short Brothers used Lympne for flight testing new aircraft during 1924.|$|E

The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object.

One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{approved}} its route <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail project, named Central Link, in November 1999, {{including four}} of the five stations in the downtown transit tunnel (excluding Convention Place). King County Executive Ron Sims proposed transferring ownership of the tunnel, along with $130 million in debt and liabilities for maintenance and operations, from King County Metro to Sound Transit in 2004. The two agencies signed an agreement in May 2000 that formally transferred ownership and responsibility for the tunnel to Sound Transit, in exchange for $195.6 million paid to King County Metro. Metro would retain ownership of Convention Place station and other assets, while Sound Transit would convert the tunnel to rail operation after 2004.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, later renamed to Sound Transit, began {{planning}} the routing {{of the light}} rail line and placement of stations in 1998. Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle requested that the line be routed along International Boulevard to serve the airport's hotel area, while other officials {{from the city of}} SeaTac favored a station inside the current Sea-Tac Airport terminal to the west. Sound Transit selected their preferred route <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail line in 1999, choosing to serve the Port of Seattle's planned North End Airport Terminal, a multi-modal facility with a direct connection to the airport's Satellite Transit System, and a potential station at South 184th Street to serve the city center.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, re-branded as Sound Transit, {{selected}} a preferred route <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail line in 1999.

Cost over-runs and withheld funding from the federal government led Sound Transit to truncate its initial light rail line to Downtown in 2001, with the segment north to the University District to be built at a later date. In 2004, Sound Transit {{selected a}} route for tunneled light rail extensions through Capitol Hill and the University District and towards Northgate, using the Montlake Cut and including a station in the vicinity of Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 45th Street.|$|E
