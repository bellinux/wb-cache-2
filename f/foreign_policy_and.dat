Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E

There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general (Strategos) for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.|$|E
5|$|Following Tipu's fall, {{a part of}} {{the kingdom}} of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The {{remaining}} territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, Krishnaraja III, was installed on the throne with chief minister (Diwan) Purnaiah, who had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and Lt. Col. Barry Close taking charge as the British Resident. The British then took control of Mysore's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore.

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories.

Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> defense with France.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, Milan Nedić, was {{appointed}} Yugoslav Minister of Defense. Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadžbina, Buđenje, Zbor, Naš put (Our Path) and Vihor (Whirlwind), were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections {{he had with}} Nedić {{to ensure that the}} banned Zbor-published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of Bilten were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.|$|E
