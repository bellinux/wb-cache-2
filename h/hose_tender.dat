50|$|In the US {{the junior}} officer grade {{of the fire}} service is the lieutenant. The most common {{insignia}} for fire department lieutenants are collar and cover devices commonly called bugles (though they are really representative of 18th century speaking trumpets); a lieutenant usually displays a single silver bugle, though some variations exist. In addition to the bugle, lieutenants often display a single silver sleeve band and wear a helmet of a different color from those worn by their subordinates, most usually limited to a white helmet shield on a black or red helmet (jurisdictionally dependant). Many cities and towns, however, employ {{a wide variety of}} other ranks and insignia. Lieutenants are typically responsible for an individual engine, <b>hose</b> <b>tender,</b> rescue squad, fire boat or ladder company and its crew.|$|E

Fire crews renewed their efforts, making a frontal attack on burning structures. Soon, {{one of the}} Fire Department's <b>Hose</b> <b>Tenders</b> arrived in the lagoon carrying [...] of [...] hose, followed shortly by another hose tenderâ€”they connected to Phoenix to relay water to more distant engine companies. In a parallel effort, the AWSS lines were inspected by city workers, temporary repairs made, and two high-pressure pump stations were brought back into operation at about 8 pm, supplying 10,000 U.S. gallons per minute. Phoenix worked until all the Marina fires were under control, pumping seawater continuously for 15 hours {{at the rate of}} 6,400 gallons per minute, a total of 5.5 million gallons (20.8 ML).|$|R
