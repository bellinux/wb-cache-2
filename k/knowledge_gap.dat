25|$|In {{terms of}} social barriers, there is a {{significant}} gap between formal legal reforms in theory and their practice in reality. In Morocco's rural and underdeveloped areas, legal equality is perceived as less of an immediate priority than basic, everyday needs. High levels of female illiteracy and a strong sense of traditionalism in many rural areas further compound these challenges. Despite educational campaigns undertaken by various governmental and non-governmental actors (often supported by donor nations such as EU member states), levels of awareness about the reforms remain low, especially in many rural areas, where misinformation about the details of the changes has often filled the <b>knowledge</b> <b>gap.</b> Many supporters of the reforms believe that lack of awareness of the law is the primary barrier to its implementation, with a lack of legal literacy {{compounded by the fact that}} many Moroccans speak a Berber dialect rather than the formal Arabic in which the law is actually written.|$|E

40|$|For regions or nations which {{historically}} have had {{low levels of}} domestic R&D investment, such as Ireland, North and South, inward investment represents a potentially important source of inward knowledge transfer. Using data from large multi-national plants throughout Ireland this paper examines the geography of knowledge within Irish manufacturing, focussing particularly on <b>knowledge</b> <b>gaps</b> and <b>knowledge</b> transfer activity. The analysis suggests four main empirical results. First, no significant <b>knowledge</b> <b>gaps</b> exist between the Irish plants of multinational (MNE) companies and international best practice. Second, larger <b>knowledge</b> <b>gaps</b> exist between MNE plants and their best local suppliers suggesting the potential for local learning in the supply chain. Average <b>knowledge</b> <b>gaps</b> to suppliers {{also tend to be}} larger in the North. Third, there is no clear evidence that knowledge transfer activity is more intensive where <b>knowledge</b> <b>gaps</b> are widest. In particular, developmental interaction between MNE plants and suppliers tends to be more common in the South. Fourth, MNE plants indicated they had a larger impact on their suppliers in the South.
