It utilizes 1990 Census migration tabulations of the residence 5 -years-ago question, along with demographic decomposition analysis. During this period, elderly births exerted a greater impact than migration on elderly gains and demographic compositions for all States. Migration from abroad is also important for State Latino and Asian <b>elderly</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The main aim of {{this study}} is to explore the patterns, {{determinants}} and subsequent mortality prediction of change in self-rated health in the <b>elderly</b> American <b>population.</b> METHODS: To achieve this purpose, we constructed logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard regression models with the complex survey dataset from the National Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II) to calculate the odds ratios (OR) / hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) of risk factors. RESULTS: Our results show that chronic disease condition and difficulty in daily activities are the main reasons for change in self-rated health status. Furthermore, change in self-rated health has significant impact on survival function in the <b>elderly</b> <b>populations.</b> When change in self-rated health status was considered, self-rated health was a stronger and more flexible predictor of mortality for <b>elderly</b> <b>populations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings will provide important information to establish effective strategies for prolonging lifespan by improving self-rated health status for <b>elderly</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R

Indirect methods include the extrapolation of parameters of models fitted to the age profile of death rates and a new method involving the extrapolation of features of death frequency distributions namely the modal age and concentration. The geometric, Ediev and Lee- Carter BMS methods were very successful in projecting death rates and very <b>elderly</b> <b>populations.</b> Differences between these methods were small. The extrapolation of parametric functions proved successful for males but less so for females.

The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 , nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census.

This trend is paralleled {{by an increase}} in chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. A limited number of studies have investigated the effect of diet on cardiometabolic risk factors (such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity) in older populations, despite the fact that diet plays a significant role in elderly health. In this review, a summary of studies that have evaluated the effect of dietary habits on cardiovascular disease risk in <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> is presented. Methods: A search was made in available databases (PubMed and Scopus) looking for results from observational studies and clinical trials that assessed dietary habits on cardiovascular disease risk in <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> (&gt; 65 years old). Studies during the last decade were retrieved and summarized. Results: All eight of the reviewed observational studies and all three reviewed clinical trials performed in <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> reported an inverse association between healthy dietary patterns with cardiovascular disease risk and its predisposing markers. Conclusion: Dietary intervention strategies should be implemented in older adults, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and improve quality of life.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} income-related inequalities in dental service utilization by the <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> residing in different European countries. We used data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE Wave 2), which contains information on utilization of dental services by 33, 358 individuals aged 50 + years from 14 different countries. We assessed income-related inequalities in dental attendance and preventive and/or operative dental treatment by means of Concentration Indices (CI) and Slope Indices of Inequality (SII). We could identify a disproportionate concentration of access to treatment among the rich <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> in all 14 countries (relative inequality according to CI), as well as significantly higher access to treatment by individuals located in the highest in relation to the lowest income group for all countries except Italy and the Czech Republic (absolute inequality according to SII). Such differential utilization appears mainly attributable to inequalities in preventive dental visits, either alone or in combination with operative treatment. Persons’ oral health status explains substantial proportions of absolute but not of relative inequalities. Overall, there is considerable income-related inequality in dental service utilization by several <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> residing in Europe.

The aim of the present article is to provide recommendations for the use of ICTs for the assessment and management of affective disorders among <b>elderly</b> <b>populations</b> with or without dementia. Methods: A Delphi panel was organized to gather recommendations from experts in the domain.
