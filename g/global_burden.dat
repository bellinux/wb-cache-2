5|$|In 2008, {{cervical}} cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) {{cervical cancer}}, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries.

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the <b>global</b> <b>burden</b> of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women.

25|$|There {{are limited}} {{national}} and international studies into the burden of ABPA, made more difficult by a non-standardized diagnostic criteria. Estimates of between 0.5–3.5% have been made for ABPA burden in asthma, and 1–17.7% in CF. Five national cohorts, detecting ABPA prevalence in asthma (based on GINA estimates), were used in a recent meta-analysis to produce {{an estimate of the}} <b>global</b> <b>burden</b> of ABPA complicating asthma. From 193 million asthma sufferers worldwide, ABPA prevalence in asthma is estimated between the extremes of 1.35–6.77 million sufferers, using 0.7–3.5% attrition rates. A compromise at 2.5% attrition has also been proposed, placing <b>global</b> <b>burden</b> at around 4.8 million people affected. The Eastern Mediterranean region had the lowest estimated prevalence, with a predicted case burden of 351,000; collectively, the Americas had the highest predicted burden at 1,461,000 cases. These are likely underestimates of total prevalence, given the exclusion of CF patients and children from the study, as well as diagnostic testing being limited in less developed regions.|$|E

40|$|Global {{simulations}} of {{sea salt and}} mineral dust aerosols are integrated into a previously developed unified general circulation model (GCM), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM II', that simulates coupled tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry and sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, primary organic carbon, and secondary organic carbon aerosols. The fully coupled gas-aerosol unified GCM allows one to evaluate {{the extent to which}} <b>global</b> <b>burdens,</b> radiative forcing, and eventually climate feedbacks of ozone and aerosols are influenced by gas-aerosol chemical interactions. Estimated present-day <b>global</b> <b>burdens</b> of sea salt and mineral dust are 6. 93 and 18. 1 Tg with lifetimes of 0. 4 and 3. 9 days, respectively. The GCM is applied to estimate current top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone and all natural and anthropogenic aerosol components. The global annual mean value of the radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone is estimated to be + 0. 53 W m(sup - 2) at TOA and + 0. 07 W m(sup - 2) at the Earth's surface. Global, annual average TOA and surface radiative forcing by all aerosols are estimated as - 0. 72 and - 4. 04 W m(sup - 2), respectively. While the predicted highest aerosol cooling and heating at TOA are - 10 and + 12 W m(sup - 2) respectively, surface forcing can reach values as high as - 30 W m(sup - 2), mainly caused by the absorption by black carbon, mineral dust, and OC. We also estimate the effects of chemistry-aerosol coupling on forcing estimates based on currently available understanding of heterogeneous reactions on aerosols. Through altering the burdens of sulfate, nitrate, and ozone, heterogeneous reactions are predicted to change the global mean TOA forcing of aerosols by 17 % and influence global mean TOA forcing of tropospheric ozone by 15 %...|$|R
