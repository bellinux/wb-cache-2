Besides formal requirements of assembly processes, the tools for controllable manipulation with these objects should not affect the examined micro/nano environment, i. e. should be "small and passive" in any sense. Despite of the recent progress, most available micro-grippers are still suffering of {{high voltage power supply}} required, short lifetime, low detection sensitivity and high price. Prototypes of a newly designed micro-gripper, having advantages over the existing analogues, have been developed, experimentally studied, and presented in this paper. The envisaged microgripper is of normally-closed type with thermo-mechanically driven actuator and piezoresistive arm-displacement feedback.

However this approach is often limited by many problems commonly encountered in the MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) structures such as: complex architectures, nonlinear behaviors and parameters uncertainties due to fabrication process at the micrometer scale. For these reasons theoretical approaches must be compared with experiments. This paper describes a modelling approach of a MEMS-based microgripper with integrated force sensor while handling micro-glass balls of 80 μm diameter. Therefore, a state space representation is developed to couple both {{the dynamics of the}} actuation and sensing subsystems of the gripper through the stiffness of the manipulated object.

Each of the two jaws of the microgripper possesses two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and is capable of positioning in both x-and y-axes. Unlike existing works, where one <b>gripper</b> <b>arm</b> is actuated and other one is sensed, both arms of the proposed microgripper are actuated and sensed independently.

40|$|Excavation {{will hold}} a key role for future lunar missions. NASA has stated that "advances in lunar {{regolith}} mining {{have the potential to}} significantly contribute to our nation's space vision and NASA space exploration operations. " [1]. The Lunabotics Mining Competition is an event hosted by NASA that is meant to encourage "the development of innovative lunar excavation concepts from universities which may result in clever ideas and solutions which could be applied to an actual lunar excavation device or payload. " [2]. Teams entering the competition must "design and build a remote controlled or autonomous excavator, called a lunabot, that can collect and deposit a minimum of 10 kilograms of lunar simulant within 10 minutes. " [2]. While excavation will play an important part in lunar missions, there will still be many other tasks that would benefit from robotic assistance. An excavator might not be as well suited for these tasks as other types of robots might be. For example a lightweight rover would do well with reconnaissance, and a mobile <b>gripper</b> <b>arm</b> would be fit for manipulation, while an excavator would be comparatively clumsy and slow in both cases. Even within the realm of excavation it would be beneficial to have different types of excavators for different tasks, as there are on Earth. The Alabama Lunabotics Team at the University of Alabama has made it their goal to not only design and build a robot that could compete in the Lunabotics Mining Competition, but would also be a multipurpose tool for future NASA missions. The 2010 - 2011 resulting robot was named the Modular Omnidirectional Lunar Excavator (MOLE).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical design, analysis, fabrication, and testing procedures {{of a new}} large-range microgripper {{which is based on}} a flexible hinge structure. The uniqueness of the gripper is that the <b>gripper</b> <b>arms</b> not only provide large gripping range but also deliver approximately rectilinear movement as the displacement in nonworking direction is extremely small. The large gripping range is enabled by a mechanism design based on dual-stage flexure amplifier to magnify the stroke of piezoelectric actuator. The first-stage amplifier is {{a modified version of the}} Scott Russell (SR) mechanism and the second-stage amplifier contains a parallel mechanism. The displacement amplification ratio of the modified SR mechanism in the gripper has been enlarged to 3. 56  times of the conventional design. Analytical static models of the gripper mechanism are developed and validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation. Results show that the gripping range is over 720  µm with a resonant frequency of 70. 7  Hz and negligible displacement in nonworking direction. The total amplification ratio of the input displacement is 16. 13. Moreover, a prototype of the gripper is developed by using aluminium 7075 for experimental testing.

Rapid and accurate performance of robotic arm movement and positioning, coupled with a reliable manipulator gripping mechanism for variable orientation and a range of deformable and/or geometric and coloured products, will lead to smarter/intelligent operation of high precision equipment. The aim of the research is to design a more effective robot arm manipulator for use in a glovebox environment utilising control kinematics together with image processing / object recognition algorithms and in particular the work is aimed at improving the movement of the robot arm in the case of unresolved kinematics, seeking improved speed and performance of object recognition along with improved sensitivity of the manipulator gripper mechanism A virtual robot arm and associated workspace was designed within the LabView 2009 environment and prototype gripper arms were designed and analysed within the Solidworks 2009 environment. Visual information was acquired by barrel cameras. Field research determines the location of identically shaped objects, and the object recognition algorithms establish the difference between them. A touch/feel device installed within the <b>gripper</b> <b>arm</b> housing ensures that the applied force is adequate to securely grasp the object without damage, but also to adapt to any slippage whilst the manipulator moves within the robot workspace.

A mechanical gripper (end-effector) suitable for grasping spherical-shaped fruits with 5 - 9 cm in diameter was designed and developed. The primary goal of the gripper design was to take and release the fruit without bruising it in a specified time sequence. A slider-crank mechanism was used to drive the gripper. To achieve suitable timing in gripping and releasing of the fruit, the slider was driven by a cam.

Unique robotic components and miniature devices are being explored, where EAP serve as actuators. EAP are increasingly being investigated for applications where there is a great need to reduce the mass, size, consumed power, and cost of the instrumentation. At JPL, a study is underway to develop effective EAP materials and employ them as actuators in space related robotic mechanisms and a series of unique mechanisms were demonstrated including a <b>gripper,</b> manipulator <b>arm</b> and surface wiper.

40|$|For many years, EAPs {{received}} {{relatively little}} attention {{due to their}} limited actuation capability and {{the small number of}} available materials. In the last ten years, new EAP materials have emerged that exhibit large displacement response to electrical stimulation and they are enabling great potentials for the field. EAP are very attractive for their operational similarity to biological muscles, particularly their resilience, damage tolerant, and ability to induce large actuation strains. The application of these materials as actuators to drive various manipulation, mobility and robotic devices involves multidiscipline including materials, chemistry, electro-mechanics, computers, electronics, etc. Even though the force actuation of existing EAP materials and their robustness require further improvement, there has already been a series of reported successes. The successful devices that were reported include miniature manipulation devices including catheter steering element, miniature manipulator, dust-wiper, miniature robotic <b>arm,</b> <b>grippers</b> and others. Some of the currently considered applications may be difficult to accomplish and it is important to scope the requirements to the level that current materials can address. Using EAP to replace existing actuators may be a difficult challenge and therefore it is highly desirable to identify a niche application where it would not need to compete with existing capabilities. This paper will review the current efforts and the expectations for the future. Keywords: EAP, Artificial Muscles, EAP Actuators, Active Polymers, Medical EAP, Manipulators 1...|$|R
