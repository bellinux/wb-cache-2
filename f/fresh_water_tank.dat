2500|$|The {{recommendation}} {{to establish a}} lighthouse on North Reef was made by a select parliamentary committee in 1864. The site was then a small sandbank on a coral reef. The proposal called for a cast iron cylindrical tower, [...] in diameter and [...] tall, which would rest on the coral, penetrating the sand. A hollow base would be formed by pouring concrete into the cylinder, which would {{also serve as a}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> and the residence will surround it. Tenders were called in January 1876, and the winning offer was for £7,964 by Walker and Company of Maryborough. Construction was to be completed in by July 1877 but delays, first in approval of the money and then in construction, delayed the completion until November 1878.|$|E
2500|$|North Reef Light is {{an active}} {{lighthouse}} located on North Reef, a [...] planar reef, about [...] northeast of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia in the Capricorn and Bunker Group. The lighthouse was constructed on a migratory patch of sand inside a fringing coral reef, which over the years disappeared and reappeared, as sand was washed away and accumulated, {{and is now a}} vegetated sandy island. Its construction is unique, having a hollow concrete base that both gives it resistance to the shifting nature of the sandbar and serves as a <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> As such, it {{is considered one of the}} major achievement in Australian lighthouse construction. It is also notable in that due to the harsh conditions, only bachelors were allowed to serve as lighthouse keepers. At [...] it is also the tallest of Queensland's timber framed iron clad lighthouses.|$|E

Post delivery keel modifications have included shaving lead off the sides of the keel and then building it back up with micro-balloons. C made full size keel section drawings available to permit fairing the keel after modification. The C 37R Wave Train, hull number 14 in the 37R production run, was so extensively customised by the factory (waterproof crash bulkhead forward, all bulkheads tabbed to the deck, upgraded deck and bulkhead construction, custom Britt Chance aluminum & lead keel) for a customer named Watt W. Webb that construction drawings specific to this boat were produced.|$|E

25|$|Every 4,000 kilometres, an {{inspection}} taking about 1½ hours is undertaken. The waste collection tanks are emptied and <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> are refilled. Acute defects (e.g. malfunctioning doors) are rectified. Furthermore, safety tests are conducted. These include checking the pantograph pressure, cleaning and checking for fissures in the rooftop insulators, inspecting transformers and checking the pantograph's current collector for wear. The wheels are also checked in this inspection.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} wave of Type IX U-boats had arrived in North American waters, and the third wave (Operation Neuland) had reached its patrol area off the oil ports of the Caribbean. With such easy {{pickings}} available and all Type IX U-boats already committed, Dönitz began sending shorter-range Type VII U-boats to the U.S. East Coast as well. This required extraordinary measures: cramming every conceivable space with provisions, some even filling the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> with diesel oil, and crossing the Atlantic at very low speed on a single engine to conserve fuel.|$|R

50|$|Since 2004 {{new rules}} are in force for <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and {{saltwater}} fishing as an aquaculture practice under specific organic labeling. <b>Fresh</b> <b>water</b> fishing in ponds is notable for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss); this species {{is also a}}dopted to land based marine aquaculture. Eel farming is also popular where water is recirculated in <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> Other varieties of fish adopted in <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fishing are mussels, oysters and crayfish. Turbot from which is mostly exported is also a species raised under aquaculture. Many species are also raised for stocking. Shell fish has also been produced and its yield has was a record 280 metric tonnes between 2004 and 2005. Approval process involves clearance from the Department of Fisheries under the Danish Environment Protection Act; recirculated eel farms are exempt under this Act.|$|R
