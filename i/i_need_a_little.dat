5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} Manchester {{would say}} of [...] "You Should Hear How She Talks About You": [...] "What was wonderful {{was that the}} song was written by two colleagues of mine, Tom Snow and Dean Pitchford. It's a solid song; {{but it was not}} the norm for me because I’m basically a troubadour. But I cut my hair off, lost lots of weight, glammed up, and ran it up the flagpole - and it worked! It worked all the way to a Grammy, which was kind of surprising. It was a lot of fun. I stopped singing it for awhile, because <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> perspective on it. But now I sing it again, and it’s kinda fun." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by a war veteran Worley met who was having a difficult time adjusting to life back home after being in a war zone for many months. Worley says, [...] "It made me think about {{what it must be like}} for all the soldiers, who have served in conflicts past and present, to adjust to being back home. The strain of war must be incredible." [...] He adds, [...] "This song is from the soldier's perspective and the message is, 'Hey man, cut me a little slack if <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time to re-adjust here. I'll get there but be a little patient with me - I just came back from a war." ...|$|E

I mean, because I’ve changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it’s not that I don’t relate but… A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like {{something}} was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> off. Maybe the thing that was off was that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record.

60|$|He {{took me out}} of the stage-coach immediately, which {{stopped at}} an inn in Brickhill; and putting into the same inn, he set up his own coach, and bespoke his dinner.

He said, No, <b>I</b> had <b>need</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rest upon the road, and that was a very good sort of a house, though it was but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> town; so we would go no farther that night, {{whatever}} came of it.|$|R

My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} of three bitter defeats in the Indy 500 for Scott Goodyear. Goodyear, an {{experienced}} road racer, was lauded by many for charging from last place (33rd) to nearly winning the race. It would have been the first time in Indy history that a driver won from the last starting position, and would have been Goodyear's first win in Indy car competition. Later in the year, he would triumph at the Michigan 500. In a post-race interview a disappointed but happy Goodyear said [...] "This is a real disappointment. When Michael Andretti lost the lead those last few laps I thought 'This is a real possibility.' It was a two-car race from there. I just couldn't get enough time against him and he just beat me. We just drove flat-out those last 3 laps and my Mackenzie team did a fantastic job. We had an up-and-down month and they gave me such a good race-car. <b>I</b> just <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to get him." ...|$|R

[...] He was annoyed when Muhammad once {{described}} the Abdulashhal clan as {{the best of the}} Ansar, followed by the Najjar, the Harith, the Sa'ida and then all the rest. He asked, [...] "Are we only fourth?" [...] and had to be dissuaded from confronting Muhammad about it to his face.|$|R
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.'

60|$|A {{few weeks}} ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of Washington buildings, the Patent office, was crowded close with rows of sick, badly wounded, and dying soldiers. They were placed in three very large apartments. I went there several times. It was a strange, solemn, and, with all its {{features}} of suffering and death, a sort of fascinating sight. I went sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases; some, <b>I</b> found, <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheering up and friendly consolation at that time, for they went to sleep better afterwards. Two of the immense apartments are filled with high and ponderous glass cases crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil, machine, or invention it ever entered {{into the mind of}} man to conceive, and with curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases were lateral openings, perhaps eight feet wide, and quite deep, and in these were placed many of the sick; besides a great long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall. Many of them were very bad cases, wounds and amputations. Then there was a gallery running above the hall, in which there were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene at night when lit up. The glass cases, the beds, the sick, the gallery above and the marble pavement under foot; the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in the various degrees; occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be repressed; sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy eyes, the nurse by his side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no relative--such were the sights but lately in the Patent office. The wounded have since been removed from there, and it is now vacant again.|$|R
5000|$|... "Therapy" [...] {{was written}} by Blige and English musicians Sam Smith and Eg White. The pair was among a host of young British acts {{commissioned}} to work with Blige in London following the success of her version of [...] "F for You", a remake of English electronic music duo Disclosure's fourth single from their debut studio album, Settle (2013), and her duet version of Smith's [...] "Stay with Me". Initially composed for Smith's debut album In the Lonely Hour (2014), [...] "Therapy" [...] was already reference-vocaled when the White and Smith played it for Blige. Upon hearing it, Blige felt inspired: [...] "It was like, 'OK. This is it. This is the first moment. This {{is the one that}} says I'm doing something different.' Slight lyrical and tonal changes were made to make it fit for her. On the process, Blige later elaborated: [...] "At the end of the day, I pictured myself singing it. I went and sang the song. And it was perfect, 'cause I just felt like the message was universal. Because <b>I</b> think everybody <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. And it's not, you know, literally sitting in front of a doctor all the time. It could be whatever your therapy is. What works for you." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} written {{as part of}} a book project entitled: “Galileian Interviews on Modern Cosmology”, {{dedicated}} to Galileo Galilei, that will be published at the beginning of 2009, the International Year of Astronomy. It is a celebrative book written as an interview to several famous and less famous astronomers working in cosmology, in formation and evolution of the Universe structures, and in general in different fields of astrophysics that are linked to the development of our knowledge of the Universe. The book will be written as a dialog between the editors and the astronomers. Question: Clusters of galaxies are powerful X-ray emitters that can be easily detected out to high redshifts, and therefore are very important tools for cosmologists. In particular, the relation between the X-ray luminosity and the temperature, and temperature and mass of the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM) offers a way to convert a luminosity function into a mass function with obvious consequences for present day cosmology. Can you comment on the state-of-the-art of these studies? How can they constrain cosmological parameters? The properties of clusters are investigated through a multi-frequency approach: from radio emission and Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, to IR-Opt-UV mapping, to X-ray emission. For example, a cluster typically appears more extended when mapped through the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect than through its X-ray emission. Can you discuss the wealth of astrophysical information achievable through the comparison among data at various bands? What advantages for cosmology come from such a multi-wavelength approach? Answer: To answer my cosmology question <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to give <b>a</b> <b>little</b> introduction on why clusters of galaxies have always been a preferred tool of cosmologists. I will start with a short description of what clusters are, give a quick background on th...|$|R
40|$|A Polish patient {{well known}} to the team was {{admitted}} with a manic relapse of bipolar affective disorder. Early on in his admission he attended an art group and there he wrote, with a bright red felt tip pen, the following poem: It continued. We came for lunch. They had horses and guns. But {{there was only one}} entrance and exit. They gave me a black quadrangle. It contained your God. You shot my cohort. 300 people. I was rather upset. You were polite. You said you wanted gold. I gave you Ashurst [psychiatric intensive care unit] sized room of gold. You melted did. You hated my 12 wives. You were scared of my army. You played poor chess and I learned Spanish in a week. You sentenced me to death for treason and polygamy. Oh yeah! And incest (whatever that is). Now I am at the airport with my blue and red Adidas back and my Wilson tennis racquet. “Please stop at the Marriott ” I tell him. YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!!! What are you doing, brother? At the time he was unable to explain what his poem meant due to his prominent flight of ideas, pressure of speech and grandiose delusions. Each of these features, unique to mania, is apparent in the prose. The disjointed sentence structure highlights the racing thoughts and tangentiality of formal thought disorder. The content is both grandiose and paranoid in nature with hypersexual and hyper-religious elements. The presentation is bright and showy, similar to the way many patients with mania present themselves. A week later, and in a less manic state, he approached me stating: “That poem I showed you, <b>I</b> realised it <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> editing. It only makes sense if you believe you’re the reincarnation of Emperor Atahualpa”. I rushed to Wikipedia, 1 and indeed that was the case...|$|R
