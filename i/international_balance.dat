25|$|The <b>international</b> <b>balance</b> {{of power}} was also {{shifting}} {{in favor of}} the Commonwealth because of the agreement with Russia in fall of 1656, motivated in part by the Tsardom's strategic interest in preventing a collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state and uncontrolled expansion of Sweden. Not giving up its own claims and gains in the east, Russia moved against the Swedish forces in Livonia, which also facilitated their removal from Lithuania. This new situation forced Charles Gustav to alter his plans of conquering all of Poland and to propose a territorial partitioning scheme, under which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was to be eliminated altogether and {{he would be able to}} keep at least some of Sweden's prospects.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "great power" [...] {{was first}} used to {{represent}} the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era. The [...] "Great Powers" [...] constituted the [...] "Concert of Europe" [...] and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Since then, the <b>international</b> <b>balance</b> of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during World War I and World War II. In literature, alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power, but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower.|$|E
2500|$|Raeder {{joined the}} Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in 1894 and rapidly rose in rank, {{becoming}} Chief of Staff for Franz von Hipper in 1912. From 1901 to 1903 Raeder {{served on the}} staff of Prince Heinrich of Prussia, and gained a powerful patron in the process. Raeder's rise up the ranks was due mostly to his intelligence and hard work. Owing to his cold and distant personality, Raeder was a man whom even his friends often admitted to knowing very little about. The dominating figure of the Navy was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the autocratic State Secretary of the Navy. Tirpitz's preferred means of obtaining [...] "world power status" [...] was through his Risikotheorie (risk theory) where Germany would build a Risikoflotte (Risk Fleet) that would make it too dangerous for Britain to risk a war with Germany, and thereby alter the <b>international</b> <b>balance</b> of power decisively in the Reichs favor. Tirpitz transformed the Navy from the small coastal defense force of 1897 into the mighty High Seas Fleet of 1914.|$|E

2500|$|Helmuth von Moltke the Younger {{took over}} from Schlieffen as Chief of the German General Staff on 1 January 1906, beset with {{doubts about the}} {{possibility}} of a German victory in a great European war. French knowledge about German intentions might prompt them to retreat to evade an envelopment that could lead to Ermattungskrieg, a war of exhaustion and leave Germany exhausted, even if it did eventually win. A report on hypothetical French ripostes against an invasion, concluded that since the French army was six times larger than in 1870, the survivors from a defeat on the frontier could make counter-outflanking moves from Paris and Lyon, against a pursuit by the German armies. Despite his doubts, Moltke (the Younger) retained the concept of a big enveloping manoeuvre, because of changes in the <b>international</b> <b>balance</b> of power. The Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) weakened the Russian army and the Tsarist state and made an offensive strategy against France more realistic for a time. By 1910, Russian rearmament, army reforms and reorganisation, including the creation of a strategic reserve, made the army more formidable than before 1905. Railway building reduced the time needed for mobilisation and a [...] "war preparation period" [...] was introduced by the Russians, to provide for mobilisation to begin with a secret order, reducing mobilisation time further.|$|E
2500|$|German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said [...] "Bretton Woods II" [...] {{should bring}} about [...] "genuine, all-encompassing {{reform of the}} {{international}} financial system". The Council of the European Union sees the meeting as [...] "tak early decisions on transparency, global standards of regulation, cross-border supervision and crisis management, to avoid conflicts of interest and to create an early warning system, so as to engender confidence among savers and investors in every country." [...] In announcing the meeting, the spokesperson for US President George Bush said that [...] "leaders will review progress being made to address the current financial crisis, advance a common understanding of its causes, and, {{in order to avoid}} a repetition, agree on a common set of principles for reform of the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world's financial sector". UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in a mid-October speech, set out several principles. These include transparency (internationally agreed accounting standards, credit insurance market standards), integrity (credit agencies, executive pay), responsibility (board member competency and expertise), sound banking practice (protecting against speculative bubbles). While addressing the G20 leaders, Chinese President Hu Jintao listed four priorities in reforming the international financial system: stepping up international cooperation in financial regulation; advancing reform of international financial institutions; encouraging regional financial cooperation; and improving the international currency system. Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the agreement was [...] "comprehensive, positive and balanced". Prior to this summit, Japan's Prime Minister, Taro Aso, had contributed feasible action plan based on the analysis of the surplus of Japan's <b>international</b> <b>balance</b> of payments in spite of her prolonged economic slump to Wall Street Journal, and also provided his idea includes funding in the meeting. Eventually Japan provided the International Monetary Fund 100 billion U.S. dollar to bolster the fund during the global economic and financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|The {{industry}} {{remains the}} most important sector of the national economy, although in the other member states the services have a more important share of GDP. In this context, the level of industrial competitiveness {{is essential for the}} national competitiveness. This is a characteristic feature for Romania, where the industry has an important share in the GDP, in comparison with the other member states. The <b>international</b> trade <b>balance</b> is an important indicator for measuring the economic competitiveness, especially the industrial competitiveness. Our country has an obvious deficit regarding the <b>international</b> trade <b>balance</b> and thus the analysis of this subject is very relevant at a sectorial level and at national economy’s branches level, when identifying solutions for raising the competitiveness. This paper is dedicated to studying Romania’s industrial competitiveness analysis throughout the recent values of the imports and exports, generated by the industry and its branches. After identifying this concern utility, this article presents the methodology used, defining and experiencing the indicators proposed for characterising the level of industrial competitiveness and also the level and dynamic of the industrial trade. In the practical part of this paper, we presented the recent evolution of the values of imports and exports for the industrial products, the share of industrial sectors in the <b>international</b> trade <b>balance,</b> particularizing the manufacturing industry – the most important industrial sector – at branch level. In the analysis of the manufacturing industry we proposed a classifying methodology divided in six levels of competitiveness, associating and characterizing the branches.
