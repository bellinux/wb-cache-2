25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} close spacing between the heads and the <b>disk</b> <b>surface,</b> HDDs {{are vulnerable to}} being damaged by a head crash – {{a failure of the}} disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss.

25|$|The {{equatorial}} region has a faster rotation speed than the polar zones. The {{result of the}} Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the solar cycle, while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), {{the extension of the}} quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole <b>disk</b> <b>surface</b> excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.|$|E
40|$|Technologies for {{manufacturing}} hard disks {{are driven by}} the demand to increase magnetic storage capacity. However, the rate of increasing storage capacity is being slowed by the inability to produce ever closer flying heights between the sliders and <b>disk</b> <b>surfaces.</b> One of important requirements for flying height is to control the surface of substrates of hard disks to a super-smooth level to allow the sliders to ‘fly’ faster and more closely to the <b>disk</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Currently, there are no any assessment standards for super-smooth surfaces. In this paper, the authors attempt to build a measurement and characterisation protocol {{for the evaluation of}} hard <b>disk</b> <b>surfaces</b> using a white-light optical instrument CCI (Coherence Correlation Interferometer). The key advantage of this instrument is its exceptionally high vertical resolution which is an order of magnitude better than comparable systems. System factors and measurement factors both influence the experimental results with CCI, this paper focuses on analysing the latter including sampling intervals, the number of measurements, measurement area filter cut-off wavelength etc. Based on the experimental results, an optimised group of parameters for measurement and characterisation are recommended. The authors have successfully measured and compared the surface roughness of six hard disks derived from differing Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) ‘abrasives’.

2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the <b>disk</b> <b>surface</b> upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple disk {{machines}} and [...] "triplex" [...] electrostatic machines (generators with three disks) were also developed extensively {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In 1900, F. Tudsbury discovered that enclosing a generator in a metallic chamber containing compressed air, or better, carbon dioxide, the insulating properties of compressed gases enabled a greatly improved effect to be obtained owing to the increase in the breakdown voltage of the compressed gas, and reduction of the leakage across the plates and insulating supports. In 1903, Alfred Wehrsen patented an ebonite rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the <b>disk</b> <b>surface.</b> In 1907, Heinrich Wommelsdorf reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; [...] "Wehrsen machine").

40|$|A tillage {{reference}} implement (TRI) {{concept to}} predict and compare draft requirements for tillage implements was developed. The reference implement concept {{was based on}} implement draft and soil and implement scale factors. The scale factors consist of a soil scale factor, implement scale factor and soil and implement scale factor. The TRI draft {{with the use of}} scale factors can predict the implement draft irrespective of soil types and field conditions. The TRI concept was tested using a tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator. The predicted implement draft values were in close agreement with the measured values. The TRI was used to determine the force differences in a tillage operation and to predict the tillage induced changes in soil properties. The TRI draft, after the implement operation, was found to be lower than that beside the operation. The relationship of implement draft to soil and implement geometric parameters need to be precisely developed to predict the tillage effect of soil properties. ^ The TRI, tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator drafts, vertical forces and torques were significantly affected by the tillage depths and travel speeds. The draft, vertical force and torque models for the implements and TRI were related as a quadratic of tillage depth. ^ A microprocessor based non-contact ultrasonic sensor was used to measure tillage depths. The sensor was tested on concrete, grass, wheat stubble, lightly disked wheat stubble and double <b>disked</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It performed well on concrete and double <b>disked</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the measured values gave coefficient of variation lower than 10 % on concrete and double <b>disked</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The precise measurements of tillage depths in the double <b>disked</b> <b>surfaces</b> were used in developing the draft model. ^ To adjust the soil scale factors for variations in soil parameters within a given soil type, a soil cone index was used as a covariate in the draft models. The effects of soil moisture content and bulk density on the cone index values were normalized using covariate analysis technique. The technique allowed treatments comparison at same and across depths. Cone index models for wheat stubble and double <b>disked</b> <b>surfaces</b> were developed based on soil depth, moisture content and bulk density. The model gave a fair estimate and the predicted values of the cone index were found within 8 % of the measured values. ...|$|R

50|$|Thin film disks, on {{the other}} hand, {{consisted}} of a metallic coating applied onto an aluminum substrate which had first been coated with a nickel-phosphate alloy (non magnetic) to add hardness to the soft aluminum substrate. The reason thin film disks could provide higher storage capacity {{has to do with}} the physics of magnetic recording. A plated or sputtered magnetic layer could be made much thinner than the coated urethane binder layer. Magnets don't like to be square, but rather rectangular. So, in the thin film one could place the magnetized domains much closer together whilst keeping the overall shape of the domain rectangular. This meant that adjacent magnetized areas of the <b>disk</b> <b>surface</b> could exist without cancelling each other out, or erasin g the information recorded on the <b>disk</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
40|$|In earlier works we {{pointed out}} that the <b>disk's</b> <b>surface</b> layers are non-turbulent and thus highly {{conducting}} (or non-diffusive) because the hydrodynamic and/or magnetorotational (MRI) instabilities are suppressed high in the disk where the magnetic and radiation pressures are larger than the plasma thermal pressure. Here, we calculate the vertical profiles of the stationary accretion flows (with radial and azimuthal components), and the profiles of the large-scale, magnetic field taking into account the turbulent viscosity and diffusivity {{and the fact that the}} turbulence vanishes at the <b>surface</b> of the <b>disk.</b> Also, here we require that the radial accretion speed be zero at the <b>disk's</b> <b>surface</b> and we assume that the ratio of the turbulent viscosity to the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is of order unity. Thus at the <b>disk's</b> <b>surface</b> there are three boundary conditions. As a result, for a fixed dimensionless viscosity α-value, we find that there is a definite relation between the ratio R of the accretion power going into magnetic disk winds to the viscous power dissipation and the midplane plasma-β, which is the ratio of the plasma to magnetic pressure in the disk. For a specific disk model with R of order unity we find that the critical value required for a stationary solution is β_c ≈ 2. 4 r/(α h), where h the disk's half thickness. For weaker magnetic fields, β > β_c, we argue that the poloidal field will advect outward while for β< β_c it will advect inward. Alternatively, if the disk wind is negligible (R≪ 1), there are stationary solutions with β≫β_c. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

In some situations provision has been made for ingestion into the disk-cavity from the gas path region radially outboard of the disk.

5000|$|Modern {{hard drives}} have mostly solved the {{stiction}} problem by using ramps to [...] "unload" [...] the heads from the <b>disk</b> <b>surface</b> on power-down. These ramps ensure the heads are not touching the platters, {{which not only}} prevents stiction but also keeps abrasion from kicking up microscopic particulates that can later contaminate the drive mechanism. Parking the heads in this manner also allows the voice coil actuator {{to be shut down}} to save power, so the heads are also frequently unloaded when the drive is idle. A competing solution is based on laser textured landing zones near the ID of the platter where no data are stored. The heads are parked in that zone, and the actuator is latched until the next start-up. The landing zone consists of a controlled array of nanometer-level 'bumps' on the <b>disk</b> <b>surface</b> produced during manufacturing of the disk using a local substrate melting process employing suitable laser-based equipment.
