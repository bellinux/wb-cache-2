500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{eventually}} released on September 27, 2002 along with Shawn Stasiak {{and his own}} cousin, Horace Hogan. Awesome quoted saying [...] "Being in the WWE (formerly the WWF) sucked. I hated it. You had to kiss everybody's ass... You {{had to be on}} your political toes all the time. You would not believe the backstage politics. You were getting stabbed in the back constantly. I was so happy when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was gone [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1945, and for {{the next}} two years, Julie Andrews {{performed}} spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. [...] "Then came the day when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," [...] Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. [...] "It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Salon,'" [...] said Miss Frisby unemotionally. [...] "They tell me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> informed....'" [...] She paused. [...] "That's all I have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First rate, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> do {{not know}} much about it myself." [...] They had risen, and were strolling along the path leading to the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} my knight," [...] replied Lady Roehampton, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the {{sovereign}} {{of all the}} chivalry, but you have my best wishes." ...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford {{to study}} at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from holiday break rehearsals. Yorke had wanted to apply to St John's to read English at the University of Oxford [...] "because that's what {{everybody}} did. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even apply – I was too thick. Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It's too rigorous." [...] At Exeter, {{he worked as a}} DJ, performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met artist Stanley Donwood, with whom he collaborates to produce artwork for Radiohead releases, and printmaker Rachel Owen, with whom he was in a relationship for over two decades.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{was born}} on September 21, 1934, into a middle-class Canadian Jewish family {{residing}} in Westmount, Quebec, an English-speaking suburb of Montreal. His mother, Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky, {{was the daughter of}} a Talmudic writer, Rabbi Solomon Klonitsky-Kline, and emigrated to Montreal in 1927 from Lithuania. His paternal grandfather, whose family had moved from Poland to Canada, was Lyon Cohen, the founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Cohen, owned a substantial clothing store and died when Cohen was nine years old. The family observed Orthodox Judaism, and belonged to Congregation Shaar Hashomayim, to which Cohen retained connections all his life. On the topic of being a Kohen, Cohen told Richard Goldstein in 1967, [...] "I had a very Messianic childhood. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was a descendant of Aaron, the high priest." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed he has Native American ancestry, and that “I was told I was Cherokee {{as a kid}}. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was Creek Indian as a kid and Chickasaw.” He has also claimed that his [...] "great-grandmother was {{quite a bit of}} Native American." [...] He has no evidence for these claims, only personal belief and Kentucky lore among non-Natives. Depp's genealogy has since been done by third-party researchers, who discovered the ancestors he believed to be Native actually had very distant African-American ancestry. Despite this discovery, Depp has continued to claim or imply he is Native. Depp's claims came under question when Indian Country Today Media Network stated that Depp has never inquired about his heritage nor does the Cherokee Nation recognize him as a member. This has led to criticism from the Native community, including of his choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger. Critical response to his claims from the Native community also included satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust so," [...] said Frank; [...] "the list {{will not}} come just yet; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain of a pass--indeed, that I stand high as to numbers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of {{them was}} taken faint and ill, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> suppose nothing <b>was</b> said or done to frighten her? You were not talking of {{anything}} very terrible, were you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John Silver," [...] he said, [...] "you're {{a prodigious}} villain and imposter--a monstrous imposter, sir. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not to prosecute you. Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then, {{there is}} an end of it. You cannot expect me to beg you to, so we will discuss the {{practical}} difficulty. I cannot under the circumstances borrow my uncle's teams, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> have not sufficient men or horses to put a large crop in." ...|$|R
6000|$|The writer let fall his hand, and {{the paper}} fluttered to the ground. [...] "The Public," [...] he thought, [...] "I am not able to take seriously, because I cannot {{conceive}} what it may be; myself, my conscience, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> must not take seriously, or I become ridiculous. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> indeed lost!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{said the}} private, meekly, [...] "I must obey my officers; so when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> to run, <b>I</b> run; and when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> to fight, <b>I</b> fight." ...|$|R

"Well, then," [...] {{said the}} {{traveller}} in the waterproof, [...] "there {{is no doubt}} that you are the person I came here to see. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> should find you here, and here you are. I may as well tell you at once, Mrs. McLeish, that your son is dead." ...|$|E
60|$|ROBERTS. Is it {{below the}} belt, Mr. Underwood? The men know. When I {{came up to}} London, I told you the {{position}} straight. An' what came of it? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> {{did n't know what}} I was talkin' about. I can't afford to travel up to London to be told that again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> <b>I</b> need take no Bills of Exchange with me, nor Letters of Credit; {{for that}} upon my first Arrival, the Inhabitants {{would be very}} civil to me: That they never {{suffered}} any of Our World to want any thing when they came there: That they were very free to show them any thing, and inform them in all needful Cases; and that whatever Rarities the Country afforded, should be expos'd immediately.|$|E

6000|$|... 'His or Mr Montague's,' said Nadgett. 'They <b>are</b> the same, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> {{accuse him}} yonder {{of the murder}} of Mr Montague, who was found last night, killed, in a wood. You will ask me why I accuse him as you have already asked me how I know so much. I'll tell you. It can't remain a secret long.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom, don't be a fool. You can't make a {{young woman}} have you if she doesn't choose. I have done all that I could for you, because I saw that you'd set your heart upon it. I went to her myself, and then I gave {{two hundred and fifty}} pounds for that bauble. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> shall have to lose a third of the sum in getting rid of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He insisted, and, {{with very}} little faith {{in the power of}} the psychic, I did as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> tied her wrists {{separately}} and then together, and, drawing both ends of the tape into my left hand, I passed them under the tip of my forefinger in such wise that I could feel any slightest movement of the psychic's hands. The guides asked me to fasten her wrists to the chair, but I replied: [...] "I am satisfied." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} I found myself very feverish, {{and went in}} to bed; but, having read somewhere that cold water drank {{plentiful}}ly was good for a fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most of the night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> should find boats that would carry me {{the rest of the}} way to Philadelphia.|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--I believe it. I am {{sure you}} are not. Mistakes have been made, {{but it has not}} been of my doing. As a boy, what could I believe but what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told?</b> <b>I</b> know now that you are and always have been as you have called yourself. If nothing else comes of it, I will at any rate say so much. The estate which your father left is no doubt yours. If I could hinder it, there should be no more law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{might break}} his neck out hunting. There is no knowing. At any rate {{there should be}} no delay. From what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> don't think that with the timber and all they'll make it come to another £5,000; but he shall have that. As he has behaved well, I'll show him that I can behave well too. I've half a mind to go up to London, and stay till it's all through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--nor mine. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing no {{good about}} the house, and {{reminded}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> penniless, what could I do but go away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is in}} Italy, and it was besieged lately. He goes on: 'and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> did not misbehave myself, nor disgrace the blud of Bruce.'" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{little farther}} on, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was in Cramond parish, {{and began to}} {{substitute}} in my inquiries {{the name of the}} house of Shaws. It was a word that seemed to surprise those of whom I sought my way. At first I thought the plainness of my appearance, in my country habit, and that all dusty from the road, consorted ill with the greatness of the place to which I was bound. But after two, or maybe three, had given me the same look and the same answer, I began to take it in my head there was something strange about the Shaws itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never can}} understand," [...] would {{sometimes}} observe Zenobia's husband to his brilliant spouse, [...] "how affairs are carried {{on in this}} world. Now we have, my dear, fifty thousand per annum; and I do not see how Ferrars can have much more than five; and yet he lives much as we do, perhaps better. I know Gibson showed me a horse last week that I very much wanted, but I would not give him two hundred guineas for it. I called there to-day to look after it again, for it would have suited me exactly, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was too late, and it was sold to Mrs. Ferrars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{there was}} no {{difficulty}} about it. I kicked up a row and pretended to be drunk. Not too bad, or they would have turned me {{straight out of the}} house, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was to go the first thing in the morning. The rest was easy enough. I had only to slip down, get it, and be off, but I had to wait some time at the door. I opened it about an inch or two, and had to stand there listening until I was sure they were both asleep. I am sorry I ever did it. I had half a mind to chuck it up three or four times, but----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make a mock of you! Oh! mine {{is a hard}} fate. When truth gushes {{from the}} well of my heart, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> mock, and when I mock, all say--he speaks truth. Be seated, Sister, and talk on freely. This Ana is my sworn friend who saved my life but now, for which deed perhaps he should be my enemy. His memory is {{excellent}} also and he will remember what you say and write it down afterwards, whereas I might forget. Therefore, with your leave, I will ask him to stay here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever {{they might}} do," [...] he replied, a little wearily, [...] "I must obey orders. My orders are to remain here, {{but even if}} <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> might go, I should find it hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you accuse me of, save of being too deeply {{interested}} in your happiness. It {{is the first time}} <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> capricious. That fault <b>is</b> not what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> usually reproached with." ...|$|R
