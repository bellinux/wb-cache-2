Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to have been worked out.|$|E

After Nepherites' death a dynastic struggle <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to have occurred, and the throne was claimed {{by two or}} maybe three pretenders: Hakor, Psammuthes, and possibly a phantom figure called Muthis who was only mentioned in Eusebius' Epithome of Manetho. As a result, Hakor was alternately considered Nepherites' legitimate successor or an unrelated usurper.|$|E
25|$|As {{the real}} cause of dancing mania was unknown, {{many of the}} {{treatments}} for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised. People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by StVitus; they responded by praying and making pilgrimages to places dedicated to Vitus.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 1986 {{a victim}} was found {{buried in a}} {{depression}} of earth in the grounds of a collective farm {{in the city of}} Bataysk. The wounds inflicted upon this victim <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to bear the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Pogoryelova's body bore all the trademark mutilations of the previous victims: her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body, some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.|$|E
25|$|Opinion polls {{throughout}} {{the election campaign}} have consistently showed a strong AKP lead over the main opposition CHP. The AKP have polled mainly within the 40–50% band, with polls occasionally showing the party to exceed the 50% band or drop as low as 35% in some cases. These significant variations {{did not appear to}} be caused by any political revelation or development, but rather due to the methods and political leanings of different polling companies. The CHP have shown to have polled within the 20–30% band, occasionally breaching the 30% boundary but never reaching party leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's target of 35%. Kılıçdaroğlu did, however, claim that private polling done by the party showed the CHP polling close to the 35% mark. Many polls showed a slight decrease in the CHP's vote share compared to their 2011 results of 26%. The MHP, having been perceived to have taken a significant number of votes from the AKP, have polled in the high teens, occasionally surpassing the 20% boundary. Critically, the HDP has hovered at around the 10% mark, which is also the election threshold that a party must win above to win representation in Parliament. Most polls have shown the HDP to be between 9 and 11%, while some have shown them to be as low as 6%. Overall, the parties' vote shares remained largely consistent {{throughout the}} election campaign, with the manifestos and rallies seeming to have made little difference to voting intentions. The CHP, however, <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to observe a slight increase after announcing their Merkez Türkiye project on 21 May.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth was lamented {{by many of}} her subjects, {{but others}} were {{relieved}} at her death. Expectations of King James started high but then declined, so by the 1620s there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated {{towards the end of}} her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: [...] "When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to revive. Then was her memory much magnified." [...] Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.|$|E

Gareth McLean stated [...] "rare is the returning British drama {{that gets you}} giddy but, back for its seventh series and resolving last year's big cliffhanger, Spooks returns triumphant," [...] adding [...] "it's no secret that Ros is back, Adam is leaving and new boy Lucas North has been rescued from a Russian prison, but how it all plays out is a delight." [...] Vicky Frost from the media blog Organgrinder felt that although the storyline was decent, [...] "it <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to be about three different episodes stuffed into one." [...] She also noted the it was generally [...] "ridiculous, but it isn't nearly as ridiculous - or ridiculously bad - as its spin-off [...] was." [...] Leigh Holmwood however, believed [...] "it was good to see the spy drama return for a seventh series with a high octane episode mixing Islamic terrorism and Russian counter espionage, {{even if it did}} overdo the 'for Queen and country' bit." [...] Holmwood also stated he was [...] "tempted to watch the second episode," [...] which was broadcast a day after the first episode on BBC One.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most EU states, {{which usually}} operate {{parliamentary}} systems, {{there is a}} separation of powers between the executive and legislative which makes the European Parliament more akin to the United States Congress than an EU state legislature. The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council {{on the basis of}} the European elections to Parliament. That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority) who [...] "elect" [...] the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament. In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament. That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public—who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.|$|E
