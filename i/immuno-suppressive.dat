50|$|Treatment {{options in}} SH and CH.SH {{has proven to}} be a {{difficult}} and frustrating condition to treat. Consequently, many of the early cases were euthanized. Originally we treated dogs with Thymosin (derived from bovine thymus) because of reports of its effectiveness in human LCH cases. Some dogs appeared to respond to this, but not consistently. The original rationale for using thymosin was that SH was likely an immunoregulatory disorder and not cancer. In the majority of instances corticosteroid treatment is ineffective, although in some instances of CH (about 10% of cases), steroid administration is very effective in controlling lesions so steroids are worth trying in this disease given the expense of the alternatives. More recently we have had success with <b>immuno-suppressive</b> doses of Cyclosporin A or Leflunomide. These drugs are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and their ability to abrogate clinical disease gives further support for SH and CH being disorders of immune regulation. Treatment with these drugs is exorbitantly expensive and may be needed for life in dogs with continuously active disease, which usually is the case in advanced SH. It is preferable not to invoke such powerful <b>immuno-suppressive</b> therapy in most cases of CH in which spontaneous regression of lesions or episodic disease activation is more likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} enhanced, intensive, <b>immuno-suppressive</b> therapy with umbilical cord blood support for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Methods A total of 25 patients with SAA received enhanced, intensive, <b>immuno-suppressive</b> therapy and a cord blood transfusion. Therapy protocol: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 2. 5 mg/(kg•d) × 5 d; Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/(kg•d) × 2 d; cyclosporin A (CsA) maintenance therapy. Result 25 patients were enrolled. 18 underwent a complete recovery, 4 made significant improvements, 1 did not respond, and 2 died. Therefore, the efficacy rate was 88 %. The median follow-up time was 35 months (range 13 - 47 months), and the 3 -year overall survival rate was 92 %. Patients rapidly achieved reconstitution of hematopoiesis. The median time to neutrophil ANC > 0. 5 × 10 9 /L was 18 days (range 8 - 36), platelets > 20 × 10 9 /L was 34 days (range 12 - 123), and Hb > 100 g/L 95 dyas (range 35 - 173).

Calcineurin inhibitors are widely used as immunosuppressive drugs, and there is still a discussion about the optimal blood levels of cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac), balancing safety and efficacy. Monitoring of calcineurin inhibitor therapy is usually per-formed by blood trough levels, pharmacokinetics such as measurement of two-hour peak levels, or by various areas under the curve assessments (AUC, 4 to 12 hours). All these mentioned phar-macokinetic measurements cannot predict the individual biological effects of the <b>immuno-suppressive</b> drug.

40|$|Tumor {{cells can}} evade immune {{surveillance}} by secreting <b>immuno-suppressive</b> {{factors such as}} transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and also, Interlukin- 10 (IL- 10). In this paper the optimal control of mathematical model for aggressive tumor growth via a new and proper approach known as AVK method has been considered. Moreover, we have implemented a special treatment so-called small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce presence and effect of TGF-β in tumor cells and also we have added Interlukin- 2 (IL- 2) into our treatment model to minimize the population of tumor cells. Further research and experimentation with these combination therapies may provide an effective solution in addressing the <b>immuno-suppressive</b> effects of TGF-β. Finally, we analyze the optimal control and system optimality of these equations using numerical techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) may exhibit immuno-suppression activities through soluble mediators and direct cell–cell contact, but how these processes are modulated has been poorly understood. In this study, we show that the Notch signaling pathway participates in the modulation of BMSCs to elicit their <b>immuno-suppressive</b> roles. In a murine lethal acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) model, BMSCs deficient for RBP-J, the critical transcription factor mediating signaling from all four mammalian Notch receptors, failed to delay {{the development of the}} disease. RBP-J deficient BMSCs were not able to inhibit the proliferation and activation of allogenic T-cells. Moreover, RBP-J deficient BMSCs could not down-regulate the expression of MHC II and co-stimulation molecules CD 80 and CD 86 on dendritic cells (DCs). The antigen presentation capacity of DCs co-cultured with RBP-J deficient BMSCs was not impaired in contrast to wild type BMSCs. Furthermore, we showed that the productions of IL- 6 and PGE 2, two critical molecules mediating the <b>immuno-suppressive</b> activities of BMSCs, were reduced significantly in RBP-J deficient BMSCs. Both of the two molecules were importantly involved in the regulation of BMSCs by Notch signaling. In conclusion, our data suggests that the <b>immuno-suppressive</b> effects of BMSCs in aGvHD are dependent on Notch-RBP-J signaling, which regulates the productions of IL- 6 and PGE 2...|$|E

40|$|Heterologous {{anti-lymphocyte serum}} (ALS) and plasma (ALP) are potent <b>immuno-suppressive</b> agents.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} supports {{the notion that}} high-dose (> 5 Gy) radiotherapy (RT) regimens are triggering stronger pro-immunogenic effects than standard low-dose (2 Gy) regimens. However, the effects of RT on certain immunoregulatory elements in tumors remain unexplored. In this study we have investigated the effects of high-dose irradiation (HD-RT) on the immunomodulating functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Primary CAF cultures were established from lung cancer specimens derived from patients diagnosed for non-small cell lung cancer. Irradiated and non-irradiated CAFs were examined for immunomodulation in experiments with {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from random, healthy donors. Regulation of lymphocytes behavior was checked by lymphocyte proliferation assays, lymphocyte migration assays and T-cell cytokine production. Additionally, CAF-secreted immuno-regulatory factors were studied by multiplex protein arrays, ELISAs and by LC-MS/MS proteomics. In all functional assays we observed a powerful <b>immuno-suppressive</b> effect exerted by CAF-conditioned medium on activated T-cells (p> 0, 001), and this effect was sustained after a single radiation dose of 18 Gy. Relevant <b>immuno-suppressive</b> molecules such as prostaglandin E 2, interleukin- 6 and - 10, or transforming growth factor-β were found in CAF conditioned medium, but their secretion was unchanged after irradiation. Finally, immunogenic cell death responses in CAFs were studied by exploring the release of high motility group box- 1 and ATP. Both alarmins remained undetectable before and after irradiation. In conclusion, CAFs play a powerful <b>immuno-suppressive</b> effect over activated T-cells, and this effect remains unchanged after HD-RT. Importantly, CAFs do not switch on immunogenic cell death responses after exposure to HD-RT...|$|E
