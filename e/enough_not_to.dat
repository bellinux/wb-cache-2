5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E

5|$|Rico's {{choice is}} taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves {{with a sense}} of estrangement. He is {{assigned}} to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL {{during the regular season}} for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} common rules {{on how to}} treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A {{worn-out}} flag must be disposed of by burning (though not {{with the intent to}} disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).|$|E

25|$|The {{equivalence}} principle, in its simplest form, {{asserts that}} the trajectories of falling bodies in a gravitational field should be independent of their mass and internal structure, provided they are small <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> disturb the environment or be affected by tidal forces. This idea has been tested to extremely high precision by Eötvös torsion balance experiments, which look for a differential acceleration between two test masses. Constraints on this, and {{on the existence of}} a composition-dependent fifth force or gravitational Yukawa interaction are very strong, and are discussed under fifth force and weak equivalence principle.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of a submarine hull is not merely that of absolute strength, but rather yield strength. As well as the obvious need for a hull strong <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be crushed at depth, the hundreds of dives over a submarine's lifetime mean that the fatigue life {{is also an important}} issue. To provide resistance to fatigue, the hull must be designed so that the steel always operates below its elastic limit; that is the stress applied by pressure is less than its yield stress. The HY- series steels were developed to provide a high yield stress, so allowing this.|$|E
25|$|The English ships {{except in}} the rigging and masts had {{sustained}} only little damage, since the Spanish aim was to board and overpower.

The English casualties were only light at best but soon the wind had died down and therefore were becalmed just before Gibraltar itself.

An animal long <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be fully engulfed upon first springing the trap, but thin and soft enough to allow the door to return fully to its set position, would indeed be left partly outside the trap until it or another body triggered the mechanism once again.

The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is tight <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill.

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong <b>enough</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E
