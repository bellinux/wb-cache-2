One mechanism for this discrimi-nation is receptor desensitization, a process whereby ligand-receptor binding is disassociated from cell activation. We examined {{the effect of}} heterologous receptor desensitization on neutrophil chemotaxis, calcium niobilization, and arachidonic acid produc-tion, using interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), C 5 a, and N-formyl-me thionyl-leuc yl-phenylalanine (fMLP). We observed reciprocal inhibition with respect to chemotaxis. We demonstrated that homologous <b>de-sensitization,</b> {{with respect to the}} mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, lasted approximately 15 nun. Heterologous desensitization between the fMLP receptor and the C 5 a receptor was reciprocal; either stimulant would diminish the cells ’ response to stimu-lation by the other for approximately 3 -S miii.

This band induces efficient non-phonon-assisted <b>de-sensitization</b> process in Er 3 +: 2. 7 mu m emission.

The present study compared (2) -coniine, (1) -coniine, and nicotine for the ability to inhibit fetal movement in a day 40 pregnant goat model and in TE- 671 cells that express fetal muscle-type nAChR. Furthermore, a-conotoxins (CTx) EI and GI were used to antagonize the actions of (1) - and (2) -coniine in TE- 671 cells. (2) -Coniine was more effective at eliciting electrical changes in TE- 671 cells and inhibiting fetal movement than was (1) -coniine, suggesting stereoselectivity by the receptor.

The research {{areas that are}} covered include mechanistic studies, the search for new therapies, as well as screening models for hazard identification of potential allergens. Recent findings Novel treatment options of both prevention and therapeutic strategies have been reported with promising results. The induction of <b>de-sensitization</b> to food proteins was achieved by exposure to a mixture of recombinant food allergens and T helper 1 (Th 1) -skewing bacterial components. Furthermore, research in animal models has provided {{new insights into the}} role of protein structure, digestion, and gut permeability in sensitization and tolerance induction to food proteins. The Th 2 hypothesis of food allergy was tested in mouse strains, linking genetic susceptibility to sensitization with differential Th 1 -Th 2 responses. In this context, the role of the liver in development of food antigen-specific Th 2 cells, and the importance of costimulatory molecules in Th 2 skewing were demonstrated. Finally, rodent models to predict potential allergenicity of novel foods have been further developed using different routes of sensitization.

This research {{has been designed to}} assess its anti-diabetic, anti-neuropathy and anti-oxidative stress effects in an invivo model of diabetes.  Methods: The hydroalcoholic extract was prepared from over-ground organs, (shoots and leaves) and underground organs (roots), and administered by gavage (50 mg/kg) for 3 weeks to mice in a streptozocin induced diabetic model. After the treatment period, blood glucose, weight and neuropathy were determined and for positive control, metformin (50 mg/kg) was used. After removing the brain and liver of mice and homogenization of tissues, the MDA and glutathione contents of the tissues have been assayed by a colorimetric method. Results: The results of this research demonstrated anti-diabetic properties of O. dichroanthum hydro alcoholic extract which demonstrated beneficial effects for some parameters such as hypoglycemia and reducing MDA. The underground organs as roots extracts showed stronger effects. However for increasing weight, diminishing neuropathy and increasing GSH contents, the effects of over-ground organs as leaves and shoots extracts were more significant.

Results show that both Pr 3 + and Ho 3 + are {{effective}} de-sensitizers, while great differences exist between {{them because of}} their non-phonon and phonon assisted energy transfer (ET) mechanisms. Ho 3 + depresses the 2. 65 mu m emission while Pr 3 + strengthens it greatly. ET coefficient indicates that Pr 3 + performs ten times higher I- 4 (13 / 2) depletion ability than Ho 3 +. In Er/Ho glasses, about 1 / 10 energy back transfers to I- 4 (13 / 2) level, which partially counterweights the depopulation of I- 4 (13 / 2) level. The high absorption cross section of Ho 3 + {{is the reason for}} the larger I- 4 (11 / 2) -> I- 5 (6) ET coefficient. Line strength and spontaneous radiation probability of I- 4 (11 / 2) -> I- 4 (13 / 2) transition enhance moderately in E, E/H and E/P order, proving that the de-sensitizers promote the 2. 7 mu m transition positively. Long lifetime of Ho 3 + :I- 5 (6) /I- 5 (7) brings many problems, such as energy back transfer and strengthened upconversion, which also implies that the interactions of the particles obstruct the effective I- 4 (11 / 2) -> I- 4 (13 / 2) transition correspondingly.

The decrease in function is receptor selective (homologous) and could result from 1) a reduction in receptor number or 2) a decrease in receptor coupling. The present investigation used photolysis of two caged opioid ligands to examine the kinetics of MOR-induced potassium conductance before and after MOR <b>de-sensitization.</b> Photolysis of a caged antagonist, carboxynitroveratryl-naloxone (caged naloxone), blocked the current induced {{by a series of}} agonists, and the time constant of decline was sig-nificantly decreased after desensitization. The increase in the rate of current decay was not observed after partial blockade of receptors with the irreversible antagonist, b-chlornaltrexamine (b-CNA). The time constant of current decay after desensitization was never more rapid than 1 second, suggesting an increased agonist off-rate rather than an increase in the rate of channel closure downstream of the receptor. The rate of G protein– coupled K 1 channel (GIRK) current activation was examined using photolysis of a caged agonist, carboxynitrobenzyl-tyrosine-[Leu 5]-enkephalin. After acute desensitization or partial irrevers-ible block of MORs with b-CNA, there was an increase in the time it took to reach a peak current. The decrease in the rate of agonist-induced GIRK conductance was receptor selective and dependent on receptor number.

We have previously reported signs of neuropathic pain in the feet of falanga victims. The objective here was to clarify underlying pain mechanisms by quantifying sensory impairments in the feet of torture victims who had experienced both generalized torture {{and those who had}} been exposed to falanga in addition. An ethnically matched control group was available. Methods We employed quantitative sensory testing (QST) by investigators blinded to whether the patients, 32 male torture victims from the Middle East, had (n= 15), or had not (n= 17) been exposed to falanga. Pain intensity, area and stimulus dependence were used to characterize the pain as were interview data on sensory symptoms. QST included thresholds for touch, cold, warmth, cold-pain, heat-pain, deep pressure pain and wind-up to cutaneous noxious stimuli in the foot soles. Clinical data on anxiety and depression were retrieved. Results Almost all falanga victims had moderate or strong pain in their feet and in twice as large an area of their foot soles as other torture victims. One-third of the latter had no pain in their feet and many reported slight pain; in spite of this, there were no differences in foot sole QST data between the tortured groups. A comparison with normal data indicated that both tortured groups had hypoesthesia for all cutaneous sensory fibre groups except those transmitting cold and heat pain, in addition to deep mechano-nociceptive hyperalgesia. Conclusion A comparison of the QST data between victims having been exposed to generalized torture and victims who in addition had been exposed to falanga, showed no differences on the group level. The sensory disturbances in relation to our control group are compatible with central sensitization and <b>de-sensitization,</b> pointing to a core role of central mechanisms.

40|$|We {{have used}} RNA {{interference}} previously {{to demonstrate that}} G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2) regulates endog-enously expressed H 1 histamine receptor in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In this report, we investigate the regulation of endogenously expressed M 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M 3 mAChR). We show that knockdown of GRK 2, GRK 3, or GRK 6, but not GRK 5, significantly increased carbachol-mediated calcium mobilization. Stable expression of wild-type GRK 2 or a kinase-dead mutant (GRK 2 -K 220 R) reduced calcium mobiliza-tion after receptor activation, whereas GRK 2 mutants defective in Gq binding (GRK 2 -D 110 A, GRK 2 -R 106 A, and GRK 2 -R 106 A/K 220 R) {{had no effect on}} calcium signaling, suggesting that GRK 2 primarily regulates Gq after M 3 mAChR activation. The knockdown of arrestin- 2 or arrestin- 3 also significantly increased carbachol-mediated calcium mobilization. Knock-down of GRK 2 and the arrestins also significantly enhanced carbachol-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2), whereas prolonged ERK 1 / 2 activa-tion was only observed with GRK 2 or arrestin- 3 knockdown. We also investigated the role of casein kinase- 1 (CK 1) and found that knockdown of CK 1 increased calcium mobilization but not ERK activation. In summary, our data suggest that multiple proteins dynamically regulate M 3 mAChR-mediated calcium signaling, whereas GRK 2 and arrestin- 3 play the pri-mary role in regulating ERK activation. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by ago-nist occupancy leads to a conformational change in the re-ceptor that promotes the activation of heterotrimeric G pro-teins, which in turn activate a variety of effectors leading to downstream signaling events (Pierce et al., 2002). Activated GPCRs are regulated by three principal mechanisms: desen-sitization, internalization, and down-regulation. Receptor <b>de-sensitization</b> is initiated by the phosphorylation of serine/ threonine residues by GPCR kinases (GRKs), which promotes the high-affinity binding of arrestins, uncoupling the receptor from G protein and terminating signaling (Krupnick an...|$|E
40|$|Glycine-independent {{desensitization}} {{is thought}} to be an impor-tant regulatory mechanism for the function of N-methyl-D-as-partate (NMDA) receptors. Previous studies have suggested that the molecular determinants for glycine-independent <b>de-sensitization</b> are located at two distinct domains of NR 2 A, i. e., the amino-terminal domain (ATD) and the pre-M 1 domain. Since the glycine-independent desensitization described in these earlier studies was a mixture of glycine-independent desensitization and zinc-dependent apparent desensitization, the exact role of these two domains in glycine-independent desensitization remains in question. In the present study, we show that deletion of the ATD of NR 2 A or mutating the pre-M 1 region of NR 2 A causes no detectable changes in the degree or the time constant of glycine-independent desensitization. Therefore, the ATD and the pre-M 1 domain of NR 2 A play no significant role in glycine-independent desensitization of NR 1 / NR 2 A receptors. On the other hand, several residues in the lurcher motif of either NR 1 or NR 2 A are critical for the glycine-independent desensitization of NR 1 /NR 2 A receptors. In addi-tion to NR 1 a(A 653 T) and NR 2 A(A 651 T), NR 1 a(T 648 C), NR 1 a(A 649 C), NR 2 A(T 646 C), and NR 2 A(A 647 C) show signifi-cantly reduced glycine-independent desensitization. Since all these mutations also alter the proton sensitivity or deactivation time constants of NR 1 /NR 2 A receptors, our data suggest that the channel gating and desensitization of NMDA receptors share common molecular determinants and that the lurcher motif of NR 1 and NR 2 A is critical for both processes. Excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate, are the most widely used neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central ner-vous system. The NMDA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor exhibiting high calcium permeability, plays a criti-cal role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development (for review, see Dingledine et al., 1999).

The system is composed of two enzymes, glyoxalase I (Glo-I) and glyoxalase II (Glo-II), and exhibits an absolute requirement for a catalytic quantity of glutathione (GSH). Glo-I catalyzes the isomerization of a hemithioacetal, formed non-enzymatically from methylglyoxal and GSH, to the corresponding a -D-hydroxyacid thioester, s-D-lactoylglutathione (SLG). Glo-II catalyzes the irreversible breakdown of SLG to D-lactate and GSH. We have observed that ATP or GTP significantly inhibits the Glo-II activity of tissue homogenates from various sources. We have developed a rapid, one step chromatography procedure to purify Glo-II such that the purified enzyme remains "sensitive" to inhibition by ATP or GTP (Glo-II-s). Studies indicate that inhibition of Glo-II-s by nucleotides is restricted to ATP, GTP, ADP, and GDP, with ATP appearing most effective. Kinetics {{studies have shown that}} ATP acts as a partial non-competitive inhibitor of Glo-II-s activity, and further suggest that two kinetically distinguishable forms of the enzyme exist. The sensitivity of pure Glo-II-s to nucleotide inhibition is slowly lost on storage even at - 80 ° C. This loss is accelerated at higher temperatures or in the presence of ATP. Kinetics studies on the resultant "insensitive" enzyme (Glo-II-i) show that a significant reduction of the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, SLG, occurs and further suggest that only one form of the enzyme is kinetically distinguishable after "de-sensitization". Tryptophan fluorescence studies of the two enzyme preparations suggest that a subtle conformational change in the enzyme has occurred during <b>de-sensitization.</b> We have also observed that Glo-II-i is "resensitized" to nucleotide inhibition after incubation {{in the presence of a}} reagent that reduces disulfide bonds. The resensitized enzyme exhibits an increased KM value similar to that of the original Glo-II-s. Kinetics studies show that ATP or GTP again act as partial non-competitive inhibitors of the resensitized enzyme and suggest that only one form of the enzyme is present.

However, TG 2 activity and products of TG 2 are detectable under normal cellular conditions in vivo; therefore, mechanisms involving sensitization to physiological [Ca 2 +] and <b>de-sensitization</b> to cellular [GTP] need to be investigated further to gain a more complete understanding of the regulation of TG 2 activity. Previously determined kinetic parameters of TG 2 Ca 2 +-dependent activity were done in the absence of physiologically relevant protein substrates of TG 2 such as casein and Z-Gln-Gly (a synthetic acyl-donor substrate). In our studies, we use recombinant [alpha]-synuclein, a physiologically relevant protein substrate of TG 2 in the context of AD and PD. We determined the initial rates of [alpha]-synuclein TG 2 -mediated polyamidation and the effect of Ca 2 + on both polyamidation and GTP-[gamma]-S inhibition of TG 2 transamidation activity. We also investigated the structural implications of varying Ca 2 + and [alpha]-synuclein concentrations on TG 2 conformation by measuring the quenching of intrinsic TG 2 fluorescence. Our data shows that (1) [alpha]-synuclein reduced the required Ca 2 + concentration for measurable TG 2 Ca 2 +-dependent activity (Ka ~ 200 [mu] M) compared to Z-Gln-Gly (Ka = 2 mM), (2) [alpha]-synuclein desensitizes TG 2 to inhibition by GTP in vitro and reduced the GTP-[gamma]-S inhibition constant (Ki) from 0. 11 ± 0. 02 to 0. 21 ± 0. 04 [mu]M, (3) the availability of [alpha]-synuclein reduced the Kd for TG 2 Ca 2 +-binding at physiologically relevant concentrations of Ca 2 + from 16 ± 3 to 9 ± 1 [mu]M, and (4) the presence/binding of [alpha]-synuclein de-sensitizes TG 2 to GTP-[gamma]-S binding/quenching by preventing the adoption of the closed/inactive TG 2 conformation. Furthermore, our data show that [alpha]-synuclein allosterically regulates TG 2 Ca 2 +-dependent activity and Ca 2 +-binding, and suggest that TG 2 exhibits substrate-induced activation. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the ability of a physiologically relevant protein substrate to regulate TG 2 cross-linking activity by sensitizing the enzyme to low [Ca 2 +] and desensitize TG 2 to GTP-induced inhibition. These results provide insight into potential cellular regulatory mechanisms of TG 2 Ca 2 +-dependent activity under physiological conditions, and, further, provide a platform for future studies to investigate other potential allosteric effectors of TG 2 activity including protein-binding partners and lipid membranes...|$|E
