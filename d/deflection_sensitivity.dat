50|$|When {{a regular}} repeating pattern is viewed on a CRT monitor {{as if it}} were a {{wallpaper}} autostereogram, it is usually possible to see depth ripples. This can also be seen in the background to a static, random-dot autostereogram. These are caused by the sideways shifts in the image due to small changes in the <b>deflection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (linearity) of the line scan, which then become interpreted as depth. This effect is especially apparent at the left hand edge of the screen where the scan speed is still settling after the flyback phase. On a TFT LCD, which functions differently, this does not occur and the effect is not present. Higher quality CRT displays also have better linearity and exhibit less or none of this effect.|$|E

The faulty settings of the glide-slope alarm circuit prevented the flag appearing until the two signals were unusable or not received. If the faulty unit received an [...] "unsatisfactory signal", the pointer could move to the mid-position. The pilot on the left seat could not notice this failure. This is dangerous. If the pointer moved to the mid-position, the crew would have thought that they were on the correct glide path.

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the poor {{tracking}} of the ILS localizer during the first approach attempt {{can be explained by}} the defect found on the Captain's ILS equipment. The flag current which was set too high is not of significance here, as the aircraft never flew in an area where this localizer flag would normally have to respond. There should have been a localizer indication the whole hand. On the other hand, it was extremely disturbing that the <b>deflection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the localizer had been set more than 50% too high. Because the localizer indication and therefore the IFS steering pointer too were so [...] "jittery", they could hardly be followed anymore. In addition, it was easy to miss crossing the localizer, as this only lasted 3-4 seconds after the second procedure turn, which was completely unsuccessful, instead of the usual 10 seconds. The difficulties in intercepting and following the localizer up to the first overshoot, which is the latest time that a change of pilot and therefore also a change of the primarily used blind flying instruments may be assumed, become evident if one compares the flight path of the first section with that of the second.|$|E

In order to measure the fibril heights, AFM tapping mode images were recorded in a physiological buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) in tapping mode with low force settings (reduced to 3 nm, 80 - 90 % of the free amplitude) to minimize interaction with the sample. We use silicon nitride probes (MSCT, tip F, 0.5 N/m, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) for these measurements. The average fibril height measured in tapping mode is used to determine the surface contact area for all three indentation methods. The indentation measurements were performed with the [...] "Point and Shoot" [...] application in the NanoScope 7.30 (Build R 2 Sr 1.) software. To locate the indentation locations we first imaged the fibrils in contact mode using another probe (MSCT, tip E, 0.1 N/m, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). This probe was selected to, on one hand, minimize the forces during contact mode imaging and, on the other hand, to match the spring constant of the cantilever to the stiffness of the sample for the indentation measurements. Every fibril was indented approximately 8 times at different positions along its length.

Measurements of soft hydrogel samples with a well-defined elastic modulus using different AFMs revealed that the uncertainties in the determination of the <b>deflection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and subsequently cantilever's spring constant were the main sources of error. SNAP eliminates those errors by calculating the correct <b>deflection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> based on spring constants determined with a vibrometer.

The development of high-performance diaphragm structure is of critical importance in the successful realization of the devices. In particular, diaphragms capable of linear deflection are needed in many pressure sensors. In order to increase the sensitivity, the diaphragm thickness should be thin to maximize the load-deflection responses.
