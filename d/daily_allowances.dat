50|$|School lunches {{must meet}} the {{applicable}} recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, {{and no more than}} 10 percent from saturated fat. School lunches must also provide one-third of the recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> of calories, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium. However, decisions about what specific foods to serve and how to prepare them are made by local school officials. The 2007 School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study III, based on research by the USDA during the 2004-05 school year, found that students in more than 90 percent of schools surveyed had the opportunity to select lunches that met dietary standards for fat and saturated fat.|$|E
50|$|The {{assessment}} of vitamin B6 status is essential, as the clinical {{signs and symptoms}} in less severe cases are not specific. The three biochemical tests most widely used are the activation coefficient for the erythrocyte enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, plasma PLP concentrations, and the urinary excretion of vitamin B6 degradation products, specifically urinary PA. Of these, plasma PLP {{is probably the best}} single measure, because it reflects tissue stores. Plasma PLP less than 10 nmol/l is indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency. A PLP concentration greater than 20 nmol/l has been chosen as a level of adequacy for establishing Estimated Average Requirements and Recommended <b>Daily</b> <b>Allowances</b> in the USA. Urinary PA is also an indicator of vitamin B6 deficiency; levels of less than 3.0 mmol/day is suggestive of vitamin B6 deficiency.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with changes}} in food, {{starting}} early in the 20th century, governments have issued nutrition guidelines, leading to the food pyramid (introduced in Sweden in 1974). The 1916 [...] "Food For Young Children" [...] became the first USDA guide to give specific dietary guidelines. Updated in the 1920s, these guides gave shopping suggestions for different-sized families along with a Depression Era revision which included four cost levels. In 1943, the USDA created the [...] "Basic Seven" [...] chart {{to make sure that}} people got the recommended nutrients. It included the first-ever Recommended <b>Daily</b> <b>Allowances</b> from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, the [...] "Essentials of an Adequate Diet" [...] brought recommendations which cut the number of groups that American school children would learn about down to four. In 1979, a guide called [...] "Food" [...] addressed the link between too much of certain foods and chronic diseases, but added [...] "fats, oils, and sweets" [...] to the four basic food groups.|$|E
50|$|The {{budgets for}} Buddhist and Muslim {{organizations}} included funds to support Buddhist and Muslim institutes of higher education, fund religious {{education programs in}} public and private schools, provide <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> for monks and Muslim clerics who hold administrative and senior ecclesiastical posts, and subsidize travel and health care for monks and Muslim clerics. Also included is an annual budget for the renovation and repair of Buddhist temples and Muslim mosques, the maintenance of historic Buddhist sites, and the daily upkeep of the central mosque in Pattani, Thailand. Other registered religious groups can request government support for renovation and repair work but do not receive a regular budget to maintain religious buildings, nor do they receive government assistance to support their clergy. In 2007 the government budgeted approximately $580,000 (18.8 million baht) for the restoration of religious buildings of religious groups, of which $362,000 (11.7 million baht) was allotted for the Muslim community, $145,000 (4.7 million baht) for the Christian, Brahmin-Hindu, and Sikh communities, and $73,000 (2.4 million baht) for special projects of all communities. Private donations to registered religious organizations are tax deductible.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} record {{relating to}} the English royal household is {{of the reign of}} Henry II and is contained in the Black Book of the Exchequer. It enumerates the various inmates of the king's palace and the <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> made to them at the period at which it was compiled. It affords evidence of the antiquity and relative importance of the court offices to which it refers, though it is silent as to the functions and formal subordination of the persons who filled them. In addition to this record, there are more recent but (for the most part) equally meagre, documents bearing on the constitution of the royal household, and extending, with long intervals, from the reign of Edward III to the reign of William III and Mary II. [...] Among them, however, are what are known as the Black Book of the Household and the Statutes of Eltham, the first compiled in the reign of Edward IV and the second in the reign of Henry VIII from which a good deal of detailed information is available concerning the arrangements of the court in the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
40|$|Recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances,</b> U. S. A., for {{ascorbic acid}} are several times the minimum daily {{requirement}} of about 10 mg to prevent clinical symptoms in adults. The recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> reflect {{the levels of}} ascorbic acid required to produce tissue saturation in human beings, so that higher doses are promptly excreted in the urine. In various investigations, responses to ascorbic acid were not obtained under conditions where the intake was considerably lower than the recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances,</b> but higher than the level needed to prevent clinical symptoms of ascorbic acid deficiency. The human ascorbic acid requirement cannot be calculated by a linear extrapolation from guinea pigs per kg of body weight because guinea pigs are much smaller than human beings and, hence, their metabolism is more rapid per unit of body weight. Evolutionary loss of ascorbic-acid-synthesizing ability may be a neutral change that was incorporated by genetic drift...|$|E
