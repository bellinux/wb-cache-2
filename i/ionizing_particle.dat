5000|$|Linear energy {{transfer}} (LET) {{is a term}} used in dosimetry. It describes the action of radiation upon matter. It {{is identical to the}} retarding force acting on a charged <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> travelling through the matter. It describes how much energy an <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> transfers to the material traversed per unit distance. By definition, LET is a positive quantity. LET depends {{on the nature of the}} radiation as well as on the material traversed.|$|E
50|$|Beyond the maximum, {{stopping}} power decreases approximately like 1/v2 with increasing particle velocity v, {{but after a}} minimum, it increases again. A minimum <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> (or mip) is a particle whose mean energy loss rate through matter {{is close to the}} minimum. In many practical cases, relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic-ray muons) are minimum ionizing particles.|$|E
50|$|The chamber {{is filled}} with {{carefully}} chosen gas, such as an argon/methane mix, such that any <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> that passes through the tube will ionize surrounding gaseous atoms. The resulting ions and electrons are accelerated by the electric field across the chamber, causing a localised cascade of ionization known as a Townsend avalanche. This collects on the nearest wire and results in a charge proportional to the ionisation effect of the detected particle. By computing pulses from all the wires, the particle trajectory can be found.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a core-shell structured <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> between two parallel conductor plates, which is biased with a direct current (DC) voltage, have been investigated. It {{has been found}} that an <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> oscillates rapidly between the DC voltage biased parallel conductors, where the frequency of oscillation depends on the free-charge density carried by the particle, the DC bias voltage, and the gap across the two conductor plates. As the presented system involves a spatially oscillating <b>ionized</b> <b>particle,</b> it represents a natural prototype for the electric dipole radiation source. Since the frequency of oscillating <b>ionized</b> <b>particle</b> depends on the DC bias voltage across the parallel conductor plates, the presented device has a broad wavelength adjustment range for the emitted radiation.

5000|$|A {{single event}} upset (SEU) is a change of state caused by one single <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> (ions, electrons, photons...) {{striking}} a sensitive node in a micro-electronic device, such as in a microprocessor, semiconductor memory, or power transistors. The state change {{is a result of}} the free charge created by ionization in or close to an important node of a logic element (e.g. memory [...] "bit"). The error in device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> passes {{into the}} {{scintillator}} material, atoms are ionized along a track. For charged particles the track is {{the path of}} the particle itself. For gamma rays (uncharged), their energy is converted to an energetic electron via either the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering or pair production. The chemistry of atomic de-excitation in the scintillator produces a multitude of low-energy photons, typically near the blue end of the visible spectrum. The number of such photons is in proportion to the amount of energy deposited by the <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle.</b> Some portion of these low-energy photons arrive at the photocathode of an attached photomultiplier tube. The photocathode emits at most one electron for each arriving photon by the photoelectric effect. This group of primary electrons is electrostatically accelerated and focused by an electrical potential so that they strike the first dynode of the tube. The impact of a single electron on the dynode releases a number of secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated to strike the second dynode. Each subsequent dynode impact releases further electrons, and so there is a current amplifying effect at each dynode stage. Each stage is at a higher potential than the previous to provide the accelerating field. The resultant output signal at the anode {{is in the form of}} a measurable pulse for each group of photons that arrived at the photocathode, and is passed to the processing electronics. The pulse carries information about the energy of the original incident radiation on the scintillator. The number of such pulses per unit time gives information about the intensity of the radiation. In some applications individual pulses are not counted, but rather only the average current at the anode is used as a measure of radiation intensity.|$|E
50|$|Even with {{chemical}} quenching, {{for a short}} time after a discharge pulse there is a period during which the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> (the so-called dead time; typically 50-100 microseconds). This causes a loss of counts at sufficiently high count rates and limits the G-M tube to an effective (accurate) count rate of approximately 103 counts per second even with external quenching. While a G-M tube is technically capable of reading higher count rates before it truly saturates, the level of uncertainty involved and the risk of saturation makes it extremely dangerous to rely upon higher count rate readings when attempting to calculate an equivalent radiation dose rate from the count rate. A consequence of this is that ion chamber instruments are usually preferred for higher count rates, however a modern external quenching technique can extend this upper limit considerably.|$|E

40|$|Search {{for highly}} <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> such as {{magnetic}} monopoles or long-lived particles {{with an electric}} charge more than the elementary charge has been subject for many experiments over the past decades. Unique signatures for such particles require techniques to be developed on the trigger, identification and reconstruction with tracking detectors and calorimeters.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the first {{results of a}} search of a {{signature}} for picosecond time stamps {{of the interaction between}} <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> and transparent crystalline media. The induced absorption with sub-picosecond rise time observed in a cerium fluoride scintillation single crystal under UV excitation is directly associated with the ionization of Ce(3 +) atoms in CeF(3) crystals, and the very fast occurrence thereof can be used to generate picosecond-precise time stamps corresponding to the interaction of <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> with the crystal in high energy physics experiments...|$|R
50|$|The {{oscilloscope}} registers {{a current}} pulse with every event. The pulse {{is merely the}} ionization current in the detector caused by this event plotted against time. The total energy of the incident particle can be found by integrating this current pulse with respect to time to yield the total charge deposited {{at the end of}} the PMT. This integration is carried out in the analog-digital converter (ADC). The total deposited charge is a direct measure of the energy of the <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> (neutron or photon) entering the neutron detector. This signal integration technique is an established method for measuring ionization in the detector in nuclear physics. The ADC has a higher dead time than the oscilloscope, which has limited memory and needs to transfer events quickly to the ADC. Thus, the ADC samples out approximately one in every 30 events from the oscilloscope for analysis. Since the typical event rate is around 106 neutrons every second, this sampling will still accumulate thousands of events every second.|$|E
50|$|At the low {{doses of}} {{relevance}} to environmental radiation exposure, individual cells only rarely experience traversals by an <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> and almost never experience {{more than one}} traversal. For example, {{in the case of}} domestic radon exposure, cancer risk estimation involves epidemiological studies of uranium miners. These miners inhale radon gas, which then undergoes radioactive decay, emitting an alpha particle This alpha particle traverses the cells of the bronchial epithelium, potentially causing cancer. The average lifetime radon exposure of these miners is high enough that cancer risk estimates are driven by data on individuals whose target bronchial cells are subjected to multiple alpha particle traversals. On the other hand, for an average house occupant, about 1 in 2,500 target bronchial cells will be exposed per year to a single alpha particle, but less than 1 in 107 of these cells will experience traversals by more than one particle. Therefore, in order to extrapolate from miner to environmental exposures, it is necessary to be able to extrapolate from the effects of multiple traversals to the effects of single traversals of a particle.|$|E
50|$|Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959), a Scottish physicist, is {{credited}} with inventing the cloud chamber. Inspired by sightings of the Brocken spectre while working on the summit of Ben Nevis in 1894, he began to develop expansion chambers for studying cloud formation and optical phenomena in moist air. Very rapidly he discovered that ions could act as centers for water droplet formation in such chambers. He pursued the application of this discovery and perfected the first cloud chamber in 1911. In Wilson's original chamber the air inside the sealed device was saturated with water vapor, then a diaphragm was used to expand the air inside the chamber (adiabatic expansion), cooling the air and starting to condense water vapor. Hence the name expansion cloud chamber is used. When an <b>ionizing</b> <b>particle</b> passes through the chamber, water vapor condenses on the resulting ions and {{the trail of the}} particle is visible in the vapor cloud. Wilson, along with Arthur Compton, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his work on the cloud chamber. This kind of chamber is also called a Pulsed Chamber because the conditions for operation are not continuously maintained. Further developments were made by Patrick Blackett who utilised a stiff spring to expand and compress the chamber very rapidly, making the chamber sensitive to particles several times a second. A cine film was used to record the images.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ionization}} {{ability of}} electrically charged particles with large relative velocities {{is higher than}} expected. In pre-relativistic physics the ability should decrease at high velocities, because the time in which <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> in motion can interact with the electrons of other atoms or molecules is diminished. Though in relativity, the higher-than-expected ionization ability {{can be explained by}} length contraction of the Coulomb field in frames in which the <b>ionizing</b> <b>particles</b> are moving, which increases their electrical field strength normal to the line of motion.|$|R

To understand the roles of these impurities in the process, a method for consistent production of high purity silver chloride, and silver bromide was developed which yields silver halides with detectable impurity content less than 1 ppm. This high purity silver chloride was used in growing crystals with controlled doping. Crystals were grown by both the Czochalski method and the Bridgman method, and the Bridgman grown crystals were used for the experiments discussed. The distribution coefficients of ten divalent cations were determined for the Bridgman crystals. The best dosimeters were made with silver chloride crystals containing 5 to 10 ppm of lead; other impurities tested did not produce proper dosimeters...|$|E
