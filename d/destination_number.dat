25|$|These four-digit {{numbers are}} dialled before the <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> to {{complete}} and bill a call by a carrier {{other than the}} subscriber's service provider. For example, to use AAPT to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx. It is not clear if all these prefixes will actually work.|$|E
5000|$|... 400-toll-free {{numbers with}} prefix [...] "4001" [...] are {{international}} toll-free numbers {{which can be}} routed to <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> inside or outside China. 400 toll-free numbers with prefix [...] "4000", [...] "4006", [...] "4007" [...] or [...] "4008" [...] are national toll-free numbers which can be routed to China <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> only.|$|R
50|$|Call Queue - A {{directory}} {{similar to}} a Hunt Group that keeps the caller on hold until one of the <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> becomes available.|$|R
50|$|Others {{services}} {{signal the}} service when placing a call, {{but do not}} call into it. Instead, the service calls both the source and <b>destination</b> <b>numbers,</b> bridges them, and records the call.|$|R
2500|$|Landlines use an open {{dialling}} plan: if the caller's phone {{shares the}} same area code as the called phone, the area code may be omitted. For example, {{a call from the}} number (02)55515678, to the number (02)70101111, will be connected if the caller dials only 70101111. Similarly, a person who dials 70105678 on a land-line or mobile phone in Melbourne (i.e., within the 03 area) will be connected to 0370105678. For this reason, landline numbers are often specified without the area code. If a person's number and the <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> share {{the same area}} code, then the area code is not required, even if it is not a [...] "local" [...] (untimed) call.|$|E

50|$|Many {{of these}} {{appear to have}} been {{originally}} three-digit codes, dialled without the leading area code, and the format of <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> dialled to the international senders has changed at various points as ability to call additional nations was added.|$|R
5000|$|A Hekemian 51A, which {{replicates}} {{the functions}} of the CMC 2600 and also produces a tape print-out of outgoing calls. Ordinary calls were recorded in black ink and <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> called via the blue box were recorded in red ink.|$|R
50|$|Hunt Group - A {{directory}} containing one or many <b>destination</b> <b>numbers</b> which, on {{receiving an}} incoming call, is programmed to ring {{them in a}} particular order, simultaneously or simply in {{the order in which}} they have most recently answered before being sent to a final destination if still unanswered.|$|R
50|$|Each time a call {{is placed}} for routing, the <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> (also {{known as the}} called party) is entered by the calling party into their terminal. The <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> {{generally}} has two parts, a prefix which generally identifies the geographical location of the destination telephone, and a number unique within that prefix that determines the specific destination terminal. Sometimes if the call is between two terminals in the same local area (that is, both terminals {{are on the same}} telephone exchange), then the prefix may be omitted.|$|E
5000|$|For dialing {{a number}} from a land line to a mobile number, a zero {{followed}} by mobile provider 2 digit code and the <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> is needed.|$|E

50|$|A nanoUDP message {{consists}} of a 5-byte nanoUDP header, an n-byte message payload and an optional 2-byte CRC checksum. The header {{consists of}} one protocol byte, a 2-byte message length (total length, including header and CRC), a 1-byte source port and a 1-byte <b>destination</b> port <b>number.</b> The <b>destination</b> port <b>number</b> should be 0x28 for SSI messages.|$|R

50|$|In {{the network}} {{there are various}} classes of {{switching}} systems. An end office switch connects directly to the stations. It knows which circuit to activate (ring) when given a <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b> Other switches in the network are for transport only. These are sometimes called tandem switches. In this case, the goal of destination routing would be to select an outbound span for a particular <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b> The objective {{is to get a}} continuous signal path from the starting location of the caller to the ending location of the called party.|$|E
50|$|Once you are {{authenticated}} you {{are usually}} presented with your balance then prompted for your <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> (the second call), and usually given the time left on your card {{based on the}} number you just dialed. Then you are connected.|$|E
50|$|Callback: Vyke {{callback}} utilizes ANI callback {{services to}} connect two phone numbers. The user initiates a call {{by sending a}} data request from the smartphone app. The caller is called back, and the second leg of the call {{is connected to the}} <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

50|$|Their urban <b>destinations,</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{and perhaps}} an {{antipathy}} towards foreigners, {{led to the}} emergence of a second wave of organized xenophobia. By the 1890s, many Americans, particularly from the ranks of the well-off, white, and native-born, considered immigration to pose a serious danger to the nation's health and security. In 1893 a group formed the Immigration Restriction League, and it, along with other similarly inclined organizations, began to press Congress for severe curtailment of foreign immigration.|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{more modern}} {{indirect}} service was introduced which required only the dialling of the access code ('132') and the <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b> Mercury also provided backbone services to the emerging groups of British cable operators which were beginning to offer their own fixed-line telephone services.|$|E
5000|$|A weak, sickly boy who has mysophobia, so he can't eat any food. Although to {{compensate}} for his disease, his ability allows him to convert 'information' into nutrient which allows him to survive. He can accidentally kill people if his ability drains a target's information beyond their limit. To keep this ability in check, the Administration Bureau arranged for him a set up so he can work as informant, and collect information in way that is safer for other human. When called, he will fake a <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> not found announcement {{and have to be}} called continuously until he finally answer. Hitsuuchi is his nickname, referring to the message when phone call failed to connect (such as <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> not found).|$|E
50|$|Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is {{the data}} {{collected}} by telecommunications companies about a consumer's telephone calls. It includes the time, date, duration and <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> of each call, the type of network a consumer subscribes to, and any other information that appears on the consumer's telephone bill.|$|E
50|$|Most {{airlines}} use {{a different}} form called an air waybill which lists additional items such as airport of <b>destination,</b> flight <b>number,</b> and time.|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{framework for}} loop-free routing based entirely on <b>destination</b> sequence <b>numbers</b> is presented. The framework eliminates the counting-to-infinity problem found in AODV and other on-demand routing protocols based on <b>destination</b> sequence <b>numbers.</b> The Sequence-Number Window Routing (SWR) protocol {{is presented as}} an example of this framework. SWR is compared via simulations with DSR, AODV and OLSR using networks of 50 and 100 mobile nodes; the results indicate that SWR is as efficient as AODV, without incurring counting to infinity. ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{can be made}} {{directly}} by dialling the country code together with the <b>destination</b> phone <b>number.</b> This {{is the most expensive}} way to call internationally.|$|R
50|$|A {{customer}} {{visits the}} call shop, and pays the operator for the call. The operator then activates {{a phone booth}} for the customer with billing software. The customer then goes to the phone booth and dials the <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b> The billing software records the call details and corresponding charges for future reference.|$|E
50|$|Many {{providers}} {{also provide}} a Web-based interface or a mobile application where a user creates an account, logs in and supplies a source number, <b>destination</b> <b>number</b> and the bogus caller ID information to be displayed. The server then places a call {{to each of the}} two endpoint numbers and bridges the calls together.|$|E
50|$|If the Service Management System were {{a central}} {{registry}} that controls routing on all toll-free telephone numbers, the RespOrgs would be its registrars. Many RespOrgs are telephone companies or long-distance carriers; a toll-free number {{provided by a}} carrier is bundled with RespOrg service adequate to send all calls through that one carrier to a single local <b>destination</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
