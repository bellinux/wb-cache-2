40|$|This {{interactive}} {{data visualization}} tool was {{installed at the}} Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane as a feature display during the Marvel Cinematic Universe exhibition that attracted record crowds from May 26 to September 3 2017. The installation included a massive wall poster (over 15 meters wide) displaying all of the Marvel film and character icons from the interface, three 55 inch multitouch displays and five large computer monitors with mouse controls. This work is an innovation in the display of data {{that is at once}} visual, intellectual and explorative. To produce such a dynamic project, the team engaged in a process of research into best practice, experiments in both interface and logic design and rigorous cycles of production and testing. At regular intervals, the work would be presented for feedback to our collaborators at both GOMA and Marvel Studios. This unique and dynamic interface allows visitors to explore the attributes of their favourite characters and to discover the complex connections between them based on their shared powers, skills, artefacts, origins and film appearances. The design team complied the database from several unofficial sources and had official verification by experts at Marvel Studios and Marvel Entertainment. Visitors can select characters from the 17 Marvel films (released from 2008 and 2017. Making this a much-valued resource by both fans and the Marvel executives, as no such official database had existed before. Especially not one with a dynamic interface for playful and detailed exploration. This project was developed using a 3 D gaming engine {{to take advantage of the}} potential ways to export the work on multiple platforms including touchscreens, mobiles, desktops and VR. Most significantly, we were able to apply physics properties to improve the ways in which the interface naturally animated and operated. To do this we developed a specific set of Force-Directed Algorithms based on three physical properties of repulsion, attraction and gravity. - Repulsion - Every node tries to get away from every other node using Coulombs law of Repulsion - Attraction - Each node is attracted to its connections using Hookes Spring Law - Gravity - Each node is drawn to the centre of the screen to avoid drifting with a small linear distance-based force that increases based on the number of nodes on the screen Main considerations for this project were that it - be aesthetically and mechanically polished - be rigorous enough to withstand thousands of interactions a day - Is able to withstand the scrutiny of hardcore fans and Marvel experts - inspires interest in the Marvel Universe from non-fans - represents both the Marvel brand and GOMA community - be a colourful and playful experience for the younger visitors The project was designed to operate in distinct modes. A design priority is that visitors can immediately recognise what the project is about and understand instantly how to interact with it. Once the visitor is familiar with the interface operations, they are able to concentrate on exploring the data and connections. Some of the Modes relate to visitor interaction and others are for the team to manage and support the project remotely: - Idle Mode – Displays an animated title screen. Automatically appears as soon as there has been no visitor interaction for 60 seconds. This is so each new visitor has the ability to begin a new session. - Start Mode - As soon as a visitor touches the screen or moves a mouse the initial <b>instruction</b> <b>diagram</b> is displayed. A second touch or click of the mouse takes the visitor into Discovery Mode. - Discovery Mode – Visitors can select films, explore characters and find connections between all of the character attributes and film appearances. - Map Mode – Visitors can create maps between several characters and attributes to contemplate, discuss and debate the many attributes and connections. - Help Mode – there is an icon on the top of the display that brings up information about how to use the interface. - Analytics Mode - only accessible by the design team, this interface was designed to capture daily interactions by visitors. In July we recorded 131, 826 visitor interactions across the 5 displays. In August, 124, 778 visitor interactions. - Remote Mode - We designed the system so we could easily remotely and immediately update the data from our studio as we predicted that some Marvel experts may find errors in the data and request additional details. No surprisingly, many of the GOMA curators and gallery members recognized and discussed the potential for this system and interface to be applied in other contexts. For example, Simon Wright (Assistant Director, GOMA) proposed that we consider a version that displayed connections between artists, materials, themes, locations, styles, etc. Researchers at the Institute for Future Environments at QUT have requested that the design team create a version that helps people to source new collaborators by searching for connections between experts, fields of study, projects, partners, methods, tools etc. “QAGOMA celebrated a record-breaking annual attendance in 2016 - 17 with 1. 73 million visitors, including almost half from interstate and overseas, and now the Marvel exhibition at GOMA has exceeded all expectations,” Ms Palaszczuk said.

This action research aims to improve the teacher’s <b>instruction</b> using <b>diagrams</b> {{as well as to}} enhance students' ability to solve problems in Linear Motion. The study involved 29 students of class 5 SNA at SMK Taman Sutera, Johor Bahru. A set of test called Ujian Kemahiran Menyelesaikan Masalah Gerakan Linear (UKMMGL) is used to measure the level of problem solving of Linear Motion before and after the teaching. The data was analyzed using percentage, mean, t-test and Pearson correlation value of 'r'. The results showed that the level of problem solving of Linear Motion increased from before teaching with mean score 33. 48 to 53. 31 after the instruction.

40|$|Science {{teaching}} involves using scientific diagrams {{to explain}} important concepts, to provide visual images, or to motivate students. However, teachers often wonder if {{their use of}} diagrams is effective in helping students learn science. This study aimed to help science teachers evaluate how students perceive their use of <b>diagrams</b> during <b>instruction.</b> Subsequently, we adapted an instrument to measure students' perceptions of science teachers' instructional use of diagrams based on Tuan et al. 's (2000) Student Perceptions of Teachers' Knowledge (SPOTK) questionnaire. The adapted instrument initially had four categories - teacher's instructional practice in using diagrams; teacher's use of multiple forms of scientific representations; teacher's use of diagrams in assessment practices; and students' understanding of and competence in using scientific diagrams. The instrument was administered to 215 Australian high school biology students in Years 9 - 10. Following factor analysis, 20 items remained in the final instrument and three scales were extracted - <b>Instruction</b> with <b>Diagrams,</b> Assessment with Diagrams, and Students' Diagrammatic Competency. The reliability of the total instrument Students' Perceptions of Teachers' Use of Biology Diagrams was 0. 91 and the reliability of each category ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 90.

30|$|The next {{explicit}} and between sessions involved single-sheet paper engineering. Again, the early sessions involved interpreting diagrams (see Fig.  5 a). <b>Diagram</b> <b>instructions</b> varied {{the angle of}} the fold, the shape of the cut, and the number of cuts. Through folding and cutting, students saw how these variations affected their 3 D pop-ups. Over time and in line with the <b>instruction</b> format (<b>diagrams</b> juxtaposed with resultant pop-ups), students practiced mental paper folding, making the connection between 2 D diagram and 3 D form (see Fig.  5 a). Unplanned exploration naturally shifted to intentional design as students’ ability to visualize cause and effect in pop-up engineering grew (see Fig.  5 b). The later lessons, paralleling the origami lessons, again had students explore and experiment. Students received pop-up models – a set of alphabet letters comprising three vowels and three consonants. They explored these models to make their own letters and words, extending from the sub-set provided to create their own name or other words (see Fig.  5 e). These lessons focused on intentional exploration, but built on earlier paper-engineering lessons. In this iterative process, students could analyze cause and effect: diagramming, realizing the resultant pop-up, and modifying the diagram based on the gap between actual and intended outcome. This intentional exploration and design practices took them from physical folding to mental folding and visualization.|$|R
