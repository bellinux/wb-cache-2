Nero Video also provides {{a wide range of}} functions for including photos and music in video projects, as well as a broad selection of transition, video, audio and title effects. In addition, it includes templates for semi-automatic film creation and for picture-in-picture effects. Once editing is complete, users can export their finished film as a file or upload it to the web. They can also use Nero Video to burn the film onto DVDs and Blu-Rays and personalize the discs’ menu and chapters step by step. Video disc creation is a separate module and can be executed directly from the start screen. That enables users to complete their disc-only projects quickly and easily. This authoring module also includes simple cropping and arranging tools.|$|E

40|$|The article {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} discourse metaphor, relatively stable metaphorical mappings that function as a <b>key</b> <b>framing</b> device within a particular discourse over {{a certain period of}} time. Discourse metaphors are illustrated by case studies from three lines of research: on the cultural imprint of metaphors, on the negotiation of metaphors and on cross-linguistic occurrence. The source concepts of discourse metaphors refer to phenomenologically salient real or fictitious objects that are part of interactional space (i. e., can be pointed at, like MACHINES or HOUSES) and/or occupy an important place in cultural imagination. Discourse metaphors change both over time and across the discourses where they are used. The implications of focussing on different types of source domains for our thinking about the embodiment and sociocultural situatedness of metaphor is discussed, with particular reference to recent developments in Conceptual Metaphor Theory.

40|$|Image processing, video {{analysis}} and computer vision techniques are presently developing rapidly {{because of the}} availability of acquisition, processing and editing tools which use current hardware and software systems. However, problems still remain in conveying this video data to the end users. Limiting factors are the resource capabilities in distributed architectures, and the features of the users' terminals. The efficient use of image processing, video indexing, and analysis techniques can provide solutions or alternatives. This thesis presents a new algorithm for video segmentation, indexing and <b>key</b> <b>framing</b> tasks. The algorithm is based on color histograms, and uses a binary penetration technique. Although a lot of work has been done in this area, most does not adequately consider the optimization of timing performance and processing storage. This is especially the case when the techniques are designed for use within run-time distributed environments. A main contribution of this thesis is to blend high performance and storage criteria with the need for effective results. The algorithm uses the temporal heuristic characteristics of the visual information in a video stream. It considers the issues of detecting false cuts and missing true cuts due to the movement of the camera, the optical flow of large objects, or both. We discuss the merits of the new algorithm compared to the existing one, supporting the discussion both with results from experiments and from the implementation of our application. We also propose a video event modeling mechanism to intelligently parse, analyze and extract the significant content information from digital video libraries or video mails. This also requires an adaptation stage in order to react to the status, policies and configuration of the end user environment. In order to build robust and extendable systems capable of dealing with future new devices that may have new specifications, we consider devices by their characteristics rather than their type (PDA, PC, cellular phone, etc).
