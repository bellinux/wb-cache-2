500|$|On September 28, in a MSNBC Town Hall, Johnson {{was asked}} by Chris Matthews to name a world leader he respected, he tried to name Vicente Fox, a former President of Mexico, but could not {{remember}} his name. The following day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held {{a lot of people in}} this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals." ...|$|E
500|$|Aden {{forms an}} {{unlikely}} friendship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). In the storyline, Morag {{wants to know}} why he has problems because she had [...] "taken a bit of a shine to him". Aden initially doesn't want her help. Whilst interviewed by Digital Spy Frances stated: [...] "There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between him and I - I take him under my wing and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what's wrong with him." [...] He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: [...] "So I sort of adopt him in a way." [...] Morag is known for her feisty persona, Lasance said Frances was one of his favourite colleagues to work with because she is the complete opposite of Morag. As a pairing they have [...] "collision chemistry" [...] because [...] "they don't really get along, but they do have respect for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
