2500|$|Survivors of {{the blaze}} {{claimed that the}} factory had sweatshop-like {{conditions}} and blamed the large loss of life on barred windows. The workers worked for [...] "well below minimum wage" [...] and endured foul smells, according to family of the victims and The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. Pay was dependent {{on the number of}} shoes produced, creating wages as little as 300 pesos (US$6.70) in a 12-hour day (minimum wage is 481 pesos). Other survivors said that the company was not making required social security and health insurance payments. A survivor who escaped from the first floor remarked, [...] "They were screaming for help, holding on to the bars. When we could no longer see their hands, we knew they had died... they died because they were trapped on the second floor." [...] Another survivor remarked, [...] "We were running not knowing exactly where to go... if people had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, it would have been different." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has received positive reception both from critics {{and the general}} public. In 2000, Edge opined that [...] "in terms of visual appeal and agility, Strider Hiryu {{ranks as one of}} the best characters ever designed." [...] In 2008, GameDaily ranked him as the fourth top Capcom character of all time, noting that he [...] "has become an extremely popular character in Capcom's arsenal." [...] That same year, IGN's Travis Fahs called him [...] "one of Capcom's best loved characters", commenting that [...] "there's no denying the iconic appeal, but for all of his flashy moves and fashion sense, Capcom has never really <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with him." [...] Strider Hiryu was one of the 64 characters chosen for the GameSpot's 2009 poll All Time Greatest Game Hero. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked this [...] "somewhat of an enduring classic" [...] as the 59th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting that his [...] "sheer levels of badass cool have seen him endure long past his clichés sell-by date, making him now an archetype rather than a stereotype." [...] In 2013, GamesRadar staff included him among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{each new}} Doctor is {{different}} from his previous incarnations, how their personalities interact varies when two or more different incarnations encounter each other. Time Crash featured Peter Davison returning as the Fifth Doctor. This event is explained as occurring due to the current Doctor having left his shields down when rebuilding the TARDIS following [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] and then accidentally crossing the Fifth Doctor's timeline, allowing the two TARDISes to merge. When the Tenth Doctor effortlessly averts the impending Belgium-sized hole in the Universe caused by this temporal anomaly, he reveals having <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do because he saw himself do it as the Fifth Doctor and remembered. He goes on to tell the Fifth Doctor how fond he was of his incarnation and how he influences the current Doctor's personality. However, in their two meetings, the Second Doctor and Third Doctor had a degree of antagonism towards each other, with the patriarchal First Doctor critical of them both. During the Virgin New Adventures, the Seventh Doctor was occasionally at odds with his subconscious memory of his previous incarnation as his memory of his past self became increasingly associated with the Valeyard, his dark, future self, but he eventually accepted his dark side and 'reformed' his memory of his former self, although it was never established how the two Doctors would interact if they had met in person.|$|E

6000|$|His {{trembling}} {{voice and}} unfeigned earnestness brought Little Dorrit to a stop. 'Oh, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do,' she cried, 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do!' ...|$|R
