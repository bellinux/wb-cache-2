According to Browngardt, they were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> the project's development.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from Korea, Bolt was {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. as an aircraft design engineer. In this duty, he was detailed to The Pentagon and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea {{for the first time to}} local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> air combat doctrine. He worked in this assignment for around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and moved to the Naval Pilot Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. During this time, he took evening classes at the University of Maryland, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Military History.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to these}} changes, FORECON has been {{detached}} and reported to multiple commanders of Marine divisions, the Command Elements (CE) of the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces, and the immediate {{commander of the}} Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). They were re-organized or reserved for 'special reconnaissance' assignments that would otherwise <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> the outcome of his battlefield. These companies, for {{a few times in}} their existence had either folded into the Marine Division, its Regiment's Recon Battalions, or dissolved entirely to only resurface during conflicts, or when other similar reasons had arisen.|$|E
25|$|The single genetic {{regulatory}} network hypothesis {{proposes that}} domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes. For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, {{may be caused}} by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> behavior and cognition. These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes. A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.|$|E

25|$|Smith's {{chapter on}} colonies {{in turn would}} <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> British {{imperial}} debates from the mid-nineteenth century onward. The Wealth of Nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's thirteen American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and, by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain {{would be able to}} develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Barlow met the {{recently}} appointed Brazilian Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil {{at the event}} Tactic Media Brazil to discuss the perspectives of digital inclusion and political participation, which in the following years would <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> Brazilian governmental policy on intellectual property and digital media. In 2004, the two began working together to expand the availability and variety of Brazilian music to remix and share online. At the same time, {{being one of the}} Digerati, Barlow was among the very first users of the invitation-only social network Orkut at its inception, and decided to send all of his 100 invitations to friends in Brazil. Two years later, out of 14 million total internet users in Brazil, 11 million were on Orkut.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd Webber {{returned}} to the project in 2006, collaborating {{with a number of}} writers and directors. However, he still did not feel the ideas he had were adaptable into a piece of musical theatre. Finally, in early 2007, Lloyd Webber approached Ben Elton (who had served as the librettist for Lloyd Webber's The Beautiful Game) to <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> a synopsis for a sequel, based on Lloyd Webber's initial ideas. Elton's treatment of the story focused more on the original characters of The Phantom of the Opera and omitted new characters that Lloyd Webber and Forsyth had developed. Lloyd Webber was pleased with Elton's treatment and began work on the sequel. In March 2007, he announced he would be moving forward with the project.|$|E

25|$|Winick {{continued}} lecturing {{on behalf}} of Zamora for three years, and his friendship with Zamora helped shape his subsequent work as a comic book writer and artist. His autobiographical graphic novel, , was published in September 2000. It was nominated for the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album: New, and won a 2001 American Library Association Stonewall Book Award for Non-Fiction Honor Books, and Winick his first GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic. It has been incorporated into school curricula across the country, such as UCLA, which made it its common book in 2013. Winick's experiences with Zamora would also <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> his work in mainstream superhero comics, which would receive considerable media attention for storylines in Green Lantern and Green Arrow which explored gay or AIDS-related themes.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} in Mass Effect 3 are impacted by choices made in previous games. When {{starting a new}} game, players with saved files from Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are given the option of importing them into Mass Effect 3 to reflect these choices. If a saved file is imported, over 1000 variables are pulled to <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> how the final chapter is experienced. If no saved files are available, there is an origin-story comic (similar to that in Mass Effect 2) to help new players make quick decisions. Imported characters' appearance and class are changeable, with more features and hair-styles included in the character creator than in Mass Effect 2. Commander Shepard always starts the game with some powers. Upon finishing the game, a New Game+ option allows players to continue playing after the main story ends, starting again with their finished Shepard to collect items they missed the first time around. The game has 82 minutes of cut-scenes.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the methods}} used in pre-Hispanic times, along with the potter's wheel, are still used to make pieces. Coiling is usually limited to {{finishing}} a piece that has first been pressed into a mold. Molding {{is the most common}} way of forming enclosed vessels. Most of these molds are concave or convex, with the clay pressed against the inside or outside of the mold. Sometimes liquid clay is poured into plaster molds. Potters wheels are most commonly used in some workshops, and often to rapidly make a succession of small vessels. Their use is more common in Guanajuato and Jalisco than other parts of the country. In many places, the wheel is powered by foot, using a kickwheel, rather than by electricity. Hand turned wheels are also used. In Oaxaca, a type of proto-wheel has been used by the Zapotecs since pre-Hispanic times. This is a saucer balanced over an inverted saucer that is turned to <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> the piece. It is most often used for the barro negro pottery made in San Bartolo Coyotepec.|$|E

500|$|In early 1833, Abram and Eliza Garfield {{joined the}} Church of Christ, a {{decision}} that would <b>help</b> <b>shape</b> their youngest son's life.
