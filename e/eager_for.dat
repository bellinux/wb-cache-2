5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney {{laid the}} groundwork for a likely 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America political action committee (PAC) to raise money for other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees.

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Laurer had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged {{for a period}} in 2003, then broke up, and then became engaged again, a pattern that continued {{for the next two}} years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. <b>Eager</b> <b>for</b> a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release. In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman.|$|E

The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours.|$|E

At 17 he travelled to Scotland in May 1936 for a holiday near Comrie and Crieff. While there he went for a five-shilling flight at the RAF Leuchars open day which, according to his mother, made up his mind to become a pilot. He gained his School Leaving Certificate and gained entry into the Royal Air Force (RAF) on a short service commission one month short of his 18th birthday in March 1937.|$|E

5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been {{noted by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, whose {{executives}} were keen to revive their own drama department's fortunes {{in the face of}} fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if {{that could be done}} at the expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|The new Prime Minister's {{attempts}} to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany {{was in no}} hurry to talk to Britain. Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit. Lord Halifax, the Lord President of the Council, visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany Nevile Henderson pronounced the visit a success. Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was too <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> talks, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, felt that he had been bypassed.|$|E

5|$|When the United States {{purchased}} Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities {{insisted that}} the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819, at {{what is now the}} border between Texas and Louisiana. <b>Eager</b> <b>for</b> new land, many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico. Due to its low population, Mexico made the area part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> social justice and convinced that a new world {{was about to be}} born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> a match between {{one of her}} two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63 BC. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for its part seemed equally <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> war and the spoils and {{prestige}} that it might bring. In 88 BC, Mithridates ordered {{the killing of a}} majority of the 80,000 Romans living in his kingdom. The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the First Mithridatic War. The Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, Gaius Marius. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

5|$|Stringer did {{not expect}} the success of Glee Cast single releases, and {{estimated}} that four million copies would be sold by Christmas2009. He was unsure whether the high sales figures would help or hinder the release of Glee: The Music, Volume1, and as such, was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> its release in order to gauge the physical and digital market response. The 17 tracks selected for the album were considered amongst the series' most popular, with Columbia and Fox aiming to attract casual buyers as well as Glee fans. Geoff Bywater, head of Fox's music department, anticipated considerable sales from impulse buyers in retail stores. Instrumental versions of some songs were included as bonus tracks, based on a trend of fans recreating the musical numbers in tribute to the show.|$|E
5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor would it be possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
5|$|The besiegers {{became aware}} of this, and, unlike the Byzantines, the Angevin commanders were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> a decisive confrontation. At this point, Sully {{resolved}} to reconnoitre the area personally, accompanied only by a bodyguard of 25 men. As he approached the Byzantine camp, he fell into an ambush by Turkish mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army. The Turks attacked the small troop, killed Sully's horse, scattered his guard, and captured him. A few of Sully's guards escaped and reached their camp, where they reported his capture. Panic spread among the Angevin troops at this news, {{and they began to}} flee towards Valona. The Byzantines took advantage of their disordered flight and attacked, joined by the troops in the besieged citadel. Many Latins fell, many others were captured as the Byzantines aimed their arrows at the less well-protected horses of the Latin knights, unhorsing them. The Byzantines also took an enormous booty, including all the numerous siege machines. Only a small remnant managed to cross the river Vjosë and reach the safety of Kanina.|$|E
