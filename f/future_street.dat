25|$|Columbushaus was {{the result}} of a plan by the French retail company Les Galeries Lafayette, whose {{flagship}} store was the legendary Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to open a counterpart in Berlin, on the Grand Hotel Belle Vue's former site, but financial worries made them pull out. Undaunted, the architect, Erich Mendelsohn (1887–1953), erected vast advertising boards around the perimeter of the site, and the revenue generated by these enabled him to proceed with the development anyway. Columbushaus was a ten-storey ultra-modern office building, years ahead of its time, containing Germany's first artificial ventilation system, and whose elegance and clean lines won it much praise. However, despite a Woolworths store on its ground floor, a major travel company housed on the floor above, and a restaurant offering fine views over the city from the top floor, the economic situation of the time meant that it would not be followed by more buildings in that vein: no further redevelopment in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz occurred prior to World War II, and so Columbushaus would always seem out of place in that location. Nevertheless, its exact position showed that the platz was starting to be opened out: the former hotel had mostly stood on a large flagged area laid out in front of it, indicating that the new building curved away from the existing street line; this would have enabled <b>future</b> <b>street</b> widening to take place.|$|E
6000|$|You perceive, at a glance, {{that this}} is the ancient and {{primitive}} wood,--the ever-youthful and venerably old,--verdant with new twigs, yet hoary, as it were, with the snowfall of innumerable years, that have accumulated upon its intermingled branches. The white man's axe has never smitten a single tree; his footstep has never crumpled a single one of the withered leaves, which all the autumns since the flood have been harvesting beneath. Yet, see! along through the vista of impending boughs, there is already a faintly traced path, running nearly east and west, as if a prophecy or foreboding of the <b>future</b> <b>street</b> had stolen {{into the heart of the}} solemn old wood. Onward goes this hardly perceptible track, now ascending over a natural swell of land, now subsiding gently into a hollow; traversed here by a little streamlet, which glitters like a snake through the gleam of sunshine, and quickly hides itself among the underbrush, in its quest for the neighboring cove; and impeded there by the massy corpse of a giant of the forest, which had lived out its incalculable term of life, and been overthrown by mere old age, and lies buried in the new vegetation that is born of its decay. What footsteps can have worn this half-seen path? Hark! Do we not hear them now rustling softly over the leaves? We discern an Indian woman,--a majestic and queenly woman, or else her spectral image does not represent her truly,--for this is the great Squaw Sachem, whose rule, with that of her sons, extends from Mystic to Agawam. That red chief, who stalks by her side, is Wappacowet, her second husband, the priest and magician, whose incantations shall hereafter affright the pale-faced settlers with grisly phantoms, dancing and shrieking in the woods, at midnight. But greater would be the affright of the Indian necromancer, if, mirrored in the pool of water at his feet, he could catch a prophetic glimpse of the noonday marvels which the white man is destined to achieve; if he could see, as in a dream, the stone front of the stately hall, which will cast its shadow over this very spot; if he could be aware that the future edifice will contain a noble Museum, where, among countless curiosities of earth and sea, a few Indian arrow-heads shall be treasured up as memorials of a vanished race! ...|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Saskatoon City Council {{approved}} {{the naming of}} one street, Alm Crescent, after Terry Alm, who had only recently ended his tenure as a city councilor in order to enter provincial politics.

5000|$|Having {{been located}} outside Copenhagen's West Tampart {{in what had}} been known as Dronningens Enghave, the new street was {{surrounded}} by open land, although Tivoli Gardens had opened at the site in 1843. Copenhagen's first railway station opened {{on the other side}} of the <b>future</b> <b>street</b> in 1847 but had moved to the other side of Vesterbrogade in 1866. Skandinavisk Panoptikon, a combination of a wax museum and a cabinet of curiosities, was opened at the corner with Vesterbrogade by Vilhelm Pacht in 1885. The building was destroyed in a fire on 4 January 1950. Cyclisten, a cycling club, constructed a 350 metres long cycle-racing track with canted curves, tribunes and restaurant at the street in 1893. It was inaugurated on 22 May and was used for six-hour races for both men and women. It was joined by Copenhagen Goods Station in 1895-1901. The station was designed by DSB's head architect Heinrich Wenck.|$|E

It doesn’t make sense - and that’s why you’re never going to hear that album. I have things that I really appreciate that belong in my iPod - my iPod only - and leave it there.|$|E
