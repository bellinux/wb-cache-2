These are a chain of convictions against Yulia Tymoshenko following one after another until some of them might “shoot”… I’m applying to my colleagues from the Ukrainian government who are present in <b>here.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are back home and report before the members of your office, tell them {{to put an end to}} these. These are shameful!" ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. I didn't {{mean to be}} <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> got home. I know I'm not fit to be {{your wife}} I haven't had any education.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I cannot say exactly,' replied Jaqui, {{very much}} {{afraid to speak}} the truth; 'in fact, I was not <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went into it: but--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Comrades, {{leave me}} here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn: [...] Leave me <b>here,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want me, sound upon the bugle horn.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{asked whether}} you {{spent much of}} your time <b>here,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> would be down again, sir," [...] Reynolds remarked, {{as he turned to}} quit the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well no more tragedies," [...] he insisted. [...] "I {{have come}} up {{to remind you that}} we have guests <b>here.</b> <b>When</b> are <b>you</b> coming down to see them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] stammered Bray, [...] "that I was <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fell, and I--I {{broke the}} fall." [...] He {{was sorry for}} it a moment afterward.|$|E
6000|$|... "The road is one {{belonging}} to this institution--in brief, a private road. You became a pupil <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> entered our carriage, that, which brought you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my boy, I shan't be <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come back. You know {{my visit}} is {{over in a}} week, and then we go to Sir Richard's estate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why Joe! Joe!" [...] Fred cried, as {{he leaped}} forward and caught Brace by the hands. [...] "How did {{you happen to}} get <b>here</b> just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were most needed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mustn't handle {{your piece}} in that <b>'ere</b> way, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come {{to have the}} charge in it, Sir,' said the tall {{gamekeeper}} gruffly; 'or I'm damned if you won't make cold meat of some on us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} didn’t," [...] exclaimed Hartley, impatiently; [...] "how could he? Look <b>here,</b> Trimblett, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{talk like that}} I don’t know where I am. If my father hadn’t married my mother I suppose he would have married {{somebody}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have; and if {{you have}} {{patience}} enough to sit here for half-an-hour I'll sketch it. If not, take a stroll, and you'll find me <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure you do, Miss Louise," [...] said Brown, easily. [...] "I'm a miner. Was <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came to town, an' I often drop {{in to see}} the fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a whiff," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll be <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come back." [...] Again {{a subtle}} cadence {{in his voice}} so belied his smile that Alice's heart responded to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear no. She's in Red Lion Square. And I'm sure, Tom, I {{never had}} her <b>here</b> except <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't dine at home. I wonder whether {{you know how}} lonely it is to sit down to dinner all by oneself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winterbourne, [...] "when {{you deal}} with natives you must go by the custom of the place. Flirting is a purely American custom; it doesn't exist <b>here.</b> So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> show {{yourself}} in public with Mr. Giovanelli, and without your mother--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Mr. Drummle, {{since we}} are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed between Herbert <b>here</b> and me, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{borrowed}} that money." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond smiled. [...] "I {{may go to}} Las Palmas or Madeira, but I'll be <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want me. We can {{fix that}} later. It seems to me I've said quite enough to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' said Guy to his tutor, 'I {{will meet}} you <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have done your {{business}} in the town, {{in an hour or}} so. Poor little thing, she has not many pleasures.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laugh at ghost! Is that {{a subject}} to laugh at? Have a care, you black rascal, or he will visit {{you in your}} galley <b>here,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will least want to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, how can I tell? But, Nina, I {{will not}} {{keep him from}} you. He shall come to <b>you</b> <b>here</b> <b>when</b> he chooses--if <b>you</b> choose it also." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. I dunno. [She shivers.] I was standin' <b>here</b> {{just now}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> was talkin', and when I heard 'im, it cam' over {{me to do}} it--like.|$|R
6000|$|Harry {{was greatly}} delighted at the news, {{and after a}} few minutes Alice {{returned}} with him to the sitting-room. She knocked at her uncle's door, and called out, [...] "We are <b>here,</b> uncle, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are ready to come in." [...] In another minute Captain Bayley entered. He went up to Mr. Adams.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Pearson's maid for Miss Alice,' said Martha, at the door. 'Oh dear, how tiresome! but you'll tell me {{all about}} it tomorrow. How horrid it will be <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are all gone!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet I daresay, Tom," [...] John said, [...] "that sometimes, {{before you}} came <b>here,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had {{as much as you}} could eat, you used to grumble if it wasn't quite what you fancied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That reminds me, I owe you fifty rupees for the condensed-milk. I {{thought perhaps}} you'd be coming <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were {{transferred}} to the Khanda district, and I could pay you then; but you didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} left me alone," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't want to come <b>here,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> insisted I did it to oblige you. As you pointed out, {{considering}} what I took out of some of you on another occasion, it seemed the fair thing. Now I hope you're satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Dan, you good-for-nothing fellow!" [...] {{she called}} out when he came near enough to be unmistakable, {{and ran down the}} steps to kiss him. [...] "What in the world are <b>you</b> doing <b>here?</b> <b>When</b> did <b>you</b> come? Why didn't you hollo, instead of letting me stand here guessing? You're not sick, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have an adorable way {{of making}} {{yourself}} understood," [...] she laughed. [...] "Come, do let us talk sense {{for a minute or}} two. <b>You</b> say that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are with me you are my slave. Then why is it that you do not bring Beatrice <b>here</b> <b>when</b> I beg <b>you</b> to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, have I not. Things are all at sixes and sevens as you say. Let me see. Donnellan was <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{last saw}} me; and I was soon tired {{of him when}} things became serious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right! Tell {{him to go}} home then, Wharton. Tell him I {{will make}} it all right with him, for losing his morning's work. Of course, you will come in <b>here,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come down the hill again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Got the wreck, have yer!" [...] came {{in almost}} a grunt from Jack Lesher. [...] "Sure enough!" [...] He {{staggered}} down to the beach. [...] "Don't see why you stay <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> might be aboard of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say so? I {{should like}} {{to sit down and}} begin at once. But, look <b>here,</b> Blyth, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> say 'draw from the life,' there can't be the {{smallest}} doubt, of course, about what you mean--but, at the same time, if you would only be a little less professional in your way of expressing yourself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's on the twenty-first, remember," [...] he continued; [...] "and if you'll {{just see}} that I'm invited I'll {{find a way}} to cross the Dreadful Desert into the {{marvelous}} Land of Oz. I've always wanted to visit the Emerald City, so I'm sure it was fortunate <b>you</b> arrived <b>here</b> just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> did, you being Princess Ozma's friend and able to assist me in getting the invitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'From {{a trading}} scow. She lays up the bend yonder. I {{was born on}} her. Pap has traded up and down here all his life; {{and he told me}} to swim off <b>here,</b> because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went by he {{said he would like to}} get some of you to speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in Cairo, and tell him--' ...|$|R
