5|$|Frohman, {{accompanied}} by several bugbait-controlled Antlions, eventually reaches Nova Prospekt, {{only to be}} turned away as he does not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment.</b> He gives up and returns to City 17 in the following strip, as Gordon Freeman finally arrives in the city, linking the comic's time frame with the start of Half-Life 2. He is then drafted into the resistance after failing to disrupt its operations, and unintentionally signals {{the start of the}} resistance's uprising after one of his Antlions accidentally kills a Combine police officer. During the fighting, he accompanies Freeman himself and mingles with resistance members, aids the Combine in the capture of Alyx Vance, one of Freeman's allies, and reunites with Norman Frohman, his long-lost assassin twin brother, only to promptly witness his death {{at the hands of a}} Strider, a large tripodal assault synth.|$|E
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> that day.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{poet and}} playwright León Felipe wrote {{a version of}} Shakespeare's play in Spanish which {{significantly}} changes the witches' role, especially in the final scene. After Macbeth's death, the Three Witches reappear {{in the midst of}} wind and storm, which they have been associated with throughout the play, to claim his corpse. They carry it to a ravine and shout, [...] "Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! / We <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with you in Hell!" [...] In the play, they also connect themselves to a painting by Francisco Goya called Volaverunt, in which three mysterious figures are flying through the air and supporting a more discernible royal female figure.|$|E

500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E
2500|$|The members soon {{drove to}} New York City with a 29 song, 3 tape demo, anticipating a signing deal with upstart Uptown Records. Upon {{arriving}} to New York, {{and without the}} knowledge of the whereabouts of the MCA subsidiary, the group used a phone book to find the company’s address, located on Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Swing later commented on the signing, [...] "we didn't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> but I knew what Uptown was, and I wanted us to be there." [...] The group was quickly denied an audition until Andre Harrell agreed to hear the demo. In skepticism of the high quality production, Harrell requested the group to perform, where they performed [...] "Come and Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "I’m Still Waiting", in the presence of Jeff Redd. Hip hop artist Heavy D overheard the performance and consulted Harrell, eventually taking the group out to dinner and awarding them a recording contract.|$|E
