25|$|Using {{sequence}} {{similarity to}} infer homology has several limitations. There is no minimum level of sequence similarity guaranteed to produce identical structures. Over {{long periods of}} evolution, related proteins may show no detectable sequence similarity to one another. Sequences with many insertions and deletions can also sometimes be difficult to align and so identify the <b>homologous</b> <b>sequence</b> regions. In the PA clan of proteases, for example, not a single residue is conserved through the superfamily, not even those in the catalytic triad. Conversely, the individual families {{that make up a}} superfamily are defined {{on the basis of their}} sequence alignment, for example the C04 protease family within the PA clan.|$|E
500|$|Double-strand breaks can be {{repaired}} through homologous recombination or through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). [...] NHEJ is a DNA repair mechanism which, unlike homologous recombination, {{does not require}} a long <b>homologous</b> <b>sequence</b> to guide repair. [...] Whether homologous recombination or NHEJ is used to repair double-strand breaks is largely determined by the phase of cell cycle. [...] Homologous recombination repairs DNA before the cell enters mitosis (M phase). [...] It occurs during and shortly after DNA replication, in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are more easily available. Compared to homologous chromosomes, which are similar to another chromosome but often have different alleles, sister chromatids are an ideal template for homologous recombination because they are an identical copy of a given chromosome. [...] In contrast to homologous recombination, NHEJ is predominant in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when the cell is growing but not yet ready to divide. [...] It occurs less frequently after the G1 phase, but maintains at least some activity throughout the cell cycle. [...] The mechanisms that regulate homologous recombination and NHEJ throughout the cell cycle vary widely between species.|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of DNA into nucleosomes and higher-order forms of chromatin in vivo creates difficulties {{with respect to}} its accessibility for cellular functions such as transcription, replication, repair and recombination. To understand the role of chromatin structure {{in the process of}} homologous recombination, we have studied the interaction of nucleoprotein filaments, comprised of RecA protein and ssDNA, with minichromosomes. Using this paradigm, we have addressed how chromatin structure affects the search for <b>homologous</b> DNA <b>sequences,</b> and attempted to distinguish between two mutually exclusive models of DNA-DNA pairing mechanisms. Paradoxically, we found that the search for <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences,</b> as monitored by unwinding of homologous or heterologous duplex DNA, was facilitated by nucleosomes, with no discernible effect on homologous pairing. More importantly, unwinding of minichromosomes required the interaction of nucleoprotein filaments and led to the accumulation of circular duplex DNA sensitive to nuclease P 1. Competition experiments indicated that chromatin templates and naked DNA served as equally efficient targets for homologous pairing. These and other findings suggest that nucleosomes do not impede but rather facilitate the search for <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> and establish, in accordance with one proposed model, that unwinding of duplex DNA precedes alignment of <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> at the level of chromatin.

40|$|Abstract One {{approach}} {{to predict the}} sec-ondary structure of RNA is the comparative approach. This approach is used when align-ment of several <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> of a RNA is available. The idea is to under-line covarying residues which maintain the Watson-Crick complementarity. The main problem {{of this approach is}} the selection of <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> to use for the predic-tion. Indeed, there are many possible com-binations of these sequences and only a few number give correct structure predictions. This is due to the low quality of alignment in helices or to variability of the <b>sequences.</b> To select <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> which are correctly aligned, we use evolutionary mod-els under structure constraints. Indeed, con-straints on secondary structure should devi-ate the evolutionary model in helices regions and sequences with correct alignment in he-lices show this deviation. We have set cri-teria to underline this deviation and dier-entiate sequences with correct helices align-ment from other sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{detection}} of conserved residue clusters on a protein structure {{is one of}} the effective strategies for the prediction of functional protein regions. Various methods, such as Evolutionary Trace, have been developed based on this strategy. In such approaches, the conserved residues are identified through comparisons of <b>homologous</b> amino acid <b>sequences.</b> Therefore, the selection of <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> is a critical step. It is empirically known that a certain degree of sequence divergence in the set of <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> is required for the identification of conserved residues. However, the development of a method to select <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> appropriate for the identification of conserved residues has not been sufficiently addressed. An objective and general method to select appropriate <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> is desired for the efficient prediction of functional regions. Results We have developed a novel index to select the sequences appropriate for the identification of conserved residues, and implemented the index within our method to predict the functional regions of a protein. The implementation of the index improved the performance of the functional region prediction. The index represents the degree of conserved residue clustering on the tertiary structure of the protein. For this purpose, the structure and sequence information were integrated within the index by the application of spatial statistics. Spatial statistics is a field of statistics in which not only the attributes but also the geometrical coordinates of the data are considered simultaneously. Higher degrees of clustering generate larger index scores. We adopted the set of <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> with the highest index score, under the assumption that the best prediction accuracy is obtained when the degree of clustering is the maximum. The set of sequences selected by the index led to higher functional region prediction performance than the sets of sequences selected by other sequence-based methods. Conclusions Appropriate <b>homologous</b> <b>sequences</b> are selected automatically and objectively by the index. Such sequence selection improved the performance of functional region prediction. As far as we know, this is the first approach in which spatial statistics have been applied to protein analyses. Such integration of structure and sequence information would be useful for other bioinformatics problems. </p...|$|R
