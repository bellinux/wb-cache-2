500|$|Eric Goldman, {{writing for}} IGN, graded the episode a 9.0 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} “amazing”. His very positive review focused on the ambiguous nature of the main plot and the subplots of Dick and Logan. He praised {{the presence of the}} majority of the main cast members, also stating that Dick’s reaction to dealing with his brother was realistic for him and in character. The reviewer called the conclusion to the case-of-the-week a “fun and satisfying one” that highlighted the moral ambiguity of main characters, something “that the show had been lacking for a while.” He highlighted this ambiguity in both Weevil in Logan, elaborating that Logan attacking Piz showed an interesting side to his personality that had not been present all season. The reviewer also lauded the cliffhanger ending, stating, “it was a reminder of <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> and intense this show can be at its best.” Television Without Pity did not grant the episode a rating but lauded the characterization of Weevil, stating, “This is the most consistently written character on the show, bar none.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Providence Journal, Andy Smith remarked {{that the author}} was [...] "a master of atmosphere, if not character" [...] – a {{sentiment}} echoed by The Post and Couriers Dan Conover, who, although praising the novel's intelligence and contemporary relevance, felt that Gibson's underlying political pre-occupation and detached narration came {{at the expense of}} character development. Neil Drumming, of Entertainment Weekly, in awarding the novel a [...] "B" [...] rating concurred, complaining that the protagonists [...] "often just feel like higher-tech automatons with useful features" [...] whose actions are the product of manipulation by [...] "external forces and cagey operatives" [...] rather than conscious decisions. In The Daily Telegraph, Roger Perkins was more blunt, remarking that the [...] "relentless pace and breathless dislocation" [...] of the plot hid [...] "character development that's as deep as dental veneer but equally shiny". Matt Thorne summed up the issue in opining that [...] "The problem with a thriller which begins with a technology journalist talking to an experimental artist is that, no matter <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> the events later become, it's hard to care." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the style and concept of [...] "Triangle". Tom Kessenich lauded the {{atmosphere}} of the entry, calling it [...] "60 minutes of The X-Files at its finest". Kessenich noted that, despite the [...] "gloom and doom" [...] talk that the series was heading in the wrong direction, stylistically, the episode proved [...] "just <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> this show can be". He ultimately concluded that it was [...] "a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality" [...] that allowed the viewer [...] "to try and ascertain what is real and what is not." [...] He later named [...] "Triangle" [...] one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, and ranked it in second place. VanDerWerff noted that he thoroughly enjoyed the concept, pointing out that the [...] "sheer level of crazy stuff that goes on in this episode makes it fun to watch". He wrote that [...] "othing else had ever been this skillfully done on television before", which resulted in a [...] "terrific episode of television". Furthermore, he opined that [...] "verything comes together in the episode's fantastically entertaining final act", due to the presence of the dramatic fight scene, among others.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recordings}} that de Sabata made in {{the studio}} are, with some exceptions, considered less gripping than {{the best of his}} work in the concert-hall and opera-house. (This {{may be related to the}} fact that he is said to have hated making recordings). Fortunately there are now several unauthorized [...] "live" [...] recordings that demonstrate <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> de Sabata could be on the podium (although the sound quality can be problematic). This contrast comes through in the two different versions of Richard Strauss's Death and Transfiguration and Verdi's Requiem listed below.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1963, the Ovshinskys had {{exhausted}} the savings with which they had initially funded ECL. [...] Before seeking public funding, Stan wanted validation {{of the importance of}} his work from a well-recognized scientist. [...] He telephoned Nobel Laureate John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor and co-discoverer of the BCS theory of superconductivity. [...] Bardeen immediately recognized the importance of Ovshinsky's work but his schedule did not permit him to visit ECL for five months. [...] Stan replied, [...] "We'll be broke by then." [...] In his place, Bardeen sent Hellmut Fritzsche, a University of Chicago physicist. Fritzsche became very positive in his support of Ovshinsky's work and helped attract other scientists to the Ovshinsky laboratory. As Fritzsche and Brian Schwartz later wrote, [...] "There is a mysterious quality in Ovshinsky's persona that attracts people into his sphere, builds life long friendships and awakens deep respect and devotion. [...] Meeting him leaves each person with a deep impression of his superior intellect, his self confidence, his compassion to improve society combined with his certainty that his vision can be realized. His enthusiasm is contagious. [...] In his presence, you feel <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> it would be to join him in his endeavors." [...] Among the many famous scientists who came regularly to ECL as friends or collaborators over the next years, were David Adler, Bardeen, Arthur Bienenstock, Morrel Cohen, Kenichi Fukui, William Lipscomb, Sir Nevill Mott, Linus Pauling, Isadore I. Rabi, Edward Teller, David Turnbull, Victor Weisskopf, and Robert R. Wilson. [...] Some joined as consultants or as members of the Board of Directors. [...] Meanwhile, the ECL community developed a uniquely productive, non-hierarchical, multicultural, international environment, reflecting Stan and Iris' social values. [...] In 1964, Stan and Iris changed the laboratory's name to Energy Conversion Devices and moved the company to larger quarters in Troy, Michigan.|$|E
2500|$|Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. According to review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received an average critic score of 72 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, [...] "They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album -- it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head -- that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album [...] "A-" [...] {{and called it}} their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review explaining [...] "Viva la Vidas mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to {{think outside the box}} when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that [...] "Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off." [...] Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that [...] "the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, [...] "For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes -- think love, war and peace -- is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of [...] "Death and All His Friends"). The band's triumph lies in <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> they make that prospect seem". IGN gave the album 9.3/10 and Q said [...] "...So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida...is an emphatic success...radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace..." [...] Robert Christgau gave it a one-star honorable mention (...) , saying, [...] "Applying all his powers, Chris Martin successfully dilutes Radiohead, with--what else?--pleasant results." ...|$|E
