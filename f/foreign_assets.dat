5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b> The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b> However, both domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b> That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|Unprecedented {{growth in}} foreign {{investment}} from the 1880s to the 1900s {{served as the}} core driver of financial globalization. The worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to US$44 billion in 1913 ($1.02 trillion in 2012 dollars), with the greatest share of <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> held by the United Kingdom (42%), France (20%), Germany (13%), and the United States (8%).

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings and {{macroeconomic policies}} in a finite-horizon model with real balances and <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings {{in a small}} open economy. Both the long- and short-run effects of these macroeconomic policies on the economy are reexamined. The main results stand in striking contrast to those of Obstfeld (1981), who used an endogenous time preference. (1) Foreign exchange intervention leads to more <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings and more consumption in the long run. However, it affects <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> accumulation ambiguously. (2) Inflation results in more <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> accumulation and consumption, but the effect of inflation on real balance holdings is ambiguous. (3) Government spending affects <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> accumulation ambiguously, and it always reduces real balances and crowds out private consumption. <b>Foreign</b> <b>asset,</b> Finite-horizon model, Macroeconomic policies...|$|R

40|$|International Monetary Fund Ongoing {{financial}} integration across countries has greatly increased two-way <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings, enhancing the scope for a “valuation channel ” of external adjustment (i. e., {{the changes in}} a country’s net <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position due to exchange rate and asset price changes). We examine this channel of adjustment in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with international equity trading. We find that two-way <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings are necessary {{for the emergence of}} a valuation channel. Its quantitative importance depends on features of the international transmission mechanism such as the size of financial frictions, substitutability across goods, and the persistence of shocks.

5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he advised that rather than using protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b> Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom says that, in {{the absence}} of default penalties, {{sovereign}} risk destroys all <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> trade. We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit and extreme assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in secondary markets. Once this assumption is relaxed, <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> trade is possible even {{in the absence}} of default penalties. In fact, in the —also extreme — case of frictionless secondary markets sovereign risk does not affect <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> trade. Overall, the results presented in this paper suggest a broader perspective regarding the origins of sovereign risk and its remedies. Sovereign risk affects <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> trade only if both, default penalties are insufficient and secondary markets work imperfectly. To reduce the effects of sovereign risk, one can either increase default penalties or improve the workings of secondary markets...|$|R

50|$|Traditional balance-of-payments {{accounting}} is {{that the}} change in the net <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position equals the current account balance.

40|$|Retirement savings allow {{investors to}} earn income after {{retirement}} by saving while {{being part of}} the workforce.

To safeguard retirement savings, exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> investments is limited. However, in an emerging economy, limiting <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> investments, especially investment in developed markets, could hamper the potential investment returns due to the translation risk.

The findings indicated how the translation effect affected the preservation provident fund, illustrating the adverse unintended consequences of investment regulation in emerging market economies.

30|$|However, {{the origin}} of current account {{imbalance}} has been theoretically explicated in two basic views.
