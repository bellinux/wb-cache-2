50|$|This {{function}} satisfies {{a functional}} equation:This functional equation implies that F(x) roughly oscillates around 1⁄2 as x approaches 1. To {{prove that the}} amplitude of oscillation is nonzero, it helps to separate F into an exactly periodic and an aperiodic part:wheresatisfies the same functional equation as F. This now implies that Ψ(x) = −Ψ(x2) = Ψ(x4), so Ψ is a periodic function of loglog(1/x). Since F and Φ are different functions, their difference Ψ is not a constant function; it oscillates with a fixed, finite amplitude as x approaches 1. Since the Φ part <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of 1⁄2, <b>F</b> oscillates as well.|$|R

In order todevelop adequate management strategies, {{this study was}} aimed atsurveying the genetic variability remaining within the species by usingRAPD analysis. To assist with the correct interpretation of the results,a matching study was conducted on four populations of the closelyrelated F. australis. Similar amounts of within-populationgenetic diversity were recorded for both species. The RAPD-based studysuggested that adult plants are contributing unevenly to successivegenerations. RAPD analysis also recognised a close evolutionaryrelationship between F. oraria and F. australis. Sequencing of cpDNA (trnL-F) and nrDNA (ITS 2) regions,confirmed recent divergence and possibly some historical reticulationbetween these two species and two {{other members of the}} genus. Ofparticular interest was the recognition that one of the F. australis populations (Limpinwood) represented a novel genotypiccombination in need of conservation attention.

Based on recent evolutionary models for low mass stars, we have formulated the selection criteria for stars with masses below 0. 5 solar mass. Using a statistical approach to correct for the background contamination, we derive the mass function of objects with masses ranging from 0. 5 solar mass down to the substellar domain, well below the Hydrogen Burning Mass Limit. The lowest mass bins in our analysis are 0. 025, 0. 045 and 0. 055 solar masses for IC 348, sigma Orionis and Pleiades, respectively. The resultant slopes of the mass functions are 0. 8 +/- 0. 2 for IC 348, 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 for sigma Orionis and 0. 5 +/- 0. 2 for Pleiades, which are consistent with the previous results.
