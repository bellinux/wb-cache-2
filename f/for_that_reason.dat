5|$|According to Yuri Moshnik, {{a modern}} historian, the {{garrison}} at Viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men; other modern historians B. Adamovich and A. I. Dubravin {{put the number}} at 4000. Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who was old and in poor health. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts to fortify the city.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa {{arranged}} a marriage for {{her younger brother}} at the instigation of their father: On 2 July 1697 Gian Gastone de' Medici married Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, heiress of the eponymous duchy, in Düsseldorf.

50|$|The {{economy has}} been growing, and an {{important}} national clothing company and a multinational beverage company have built their centers of distribution in Palhoça.

5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a {{justification}} for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> he chose to pull the Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort.

40|$|Corruption is {{a global}} phenomenon. It is not {{surprising}} that it affects sports too. The first step to understand properly this phenomenon is its conceptualization and typology.

5|$|Reflecting {{the basic}} {{properties}} of ZnO, fine particles of the oxide have deodorizing and antibacterial properties and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> are added into materials including cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. This property {{results from the}} increased surface area of the fine particles.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships {{over the}} next eight weeks. Author Paul Halpern reports that the {{majority}} of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were undergoing repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific mention is made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's inactivity in this period may be <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure is believed to have struck half eagles first <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason.</b> He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E

The man who cannot speak or write without scolding and exaggeration, is not very {{likely to be able}} to give sound advice to his fellow-men.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Epistemic {{reasons are}} mental states. They are not propositions or non-mental facts. The {{discussion}} proceeds as follows. Section 1 introduces the topic. Section 2 gives two concrete {{examples of how}} our topic directly affects the internalism/externalism debate in normative epistemology. Section 3 responds to an argument against the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are mental states. Section 4 presents two problems <b>for</b> the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are propositions. Section 5 presents two problems <b>for</b> the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are non-mental facts. Section 6 argues <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are mental states.

5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 {{a series}} of {{revolutions}} struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest advocates of that status quo, the uprising in Poland and the ousting of the tsar as the king of Poland by the Sejm and Senate of Poland on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious irritant. Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in Poland was quelled. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main target in the war {{from the start of}} hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{met with}} the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options. The President was {{concerned}} that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At {{the end of the}} meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further.|$|E

5|$|On Nørregade, another {{fire started}} at a brewery Wednesday evening – {{possibly}} between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just {{prior to that}} the original fire had reached Gammeltorv, where people fought to keep the fire back. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> help was sent late {{to deal with the}} new fire. Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day Nørre Voldgade towards Nørreport (North Gate).|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E
