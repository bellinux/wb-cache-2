40|$|Purpose - This {{paper is}} to be {{concerned}} with the corporate governance mechanisms’ influence on governance and <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> in Southeast Europe (Western Balkans) transition economies: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Hence, the basic hypothesis to test governance and <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> is that it is influenced by gross domestic product and foreign direct investments dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - The econometric model that is used in this study is a regression model. Further, the estimation is based on data provided by the data bases of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transition report series, the World Bank Database and the National Banks’ databases of the countries in Southeastern Europe. The hypothesis is that the variable governance and <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> is encouraged by movements in gross domestic product and especially foreign direct investments dynamics.

40|$|The {{position}} of enterprises, industries and economies {{on the market}} depends on their response {{to a wide range}} of incentives, market trends, technological changes, government policies and institutional reforms. The adjustments made by companies so as to take over their rivals’ market are commonly referred to as restructuring.

Over past two decades <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> has been prominent feature of firm behaviour in Central and East European countries.

30|$|In Wenzhou, 46.38  % of the chairmen {{of private}} {{enterprises}} are party members, 41.81  % {{of the general}} managers are party members, and 50  % of companies {{do not have a}} party group. The fact that political beliefs are high among private business owners and the proportion of nonstate party organization is also high has its expected reasons. First, national policy promotes political beliefs. The 2002 revised Party Constitution and nonstate party organization construction policy in 2003 incorporated private business owners into the development of the Communist Party of China. The proportion of private entrepreneurs with Communist Party membership reached around one-third up to 2011. Among private businesses with scales of more than 100 million yuan of assets, 53.2  % of their owners hold party membership; another 40  % are willing {{to become part of the}} Communist Party (Zhang and Lu 2013). The proportion of private enterprises that establish party organizations increases by 2 to 3  % every 2  years; to date about 30 to 40  % of private companies have established party groups. In nearly 70  % of these companies, the position of committee (party branch) secretary is held by the private business owner (Zhang and Lu 2013 : 306 – 307). Second, after Xiaoping Deng’s southern trip in 1992, the 1994 state enterprise consolidation policies promoted rapid development of China’s private economy. As private enterprises revealed their identity, a number of state-owned/collective <b>enterprises</b> <b>restructured</b> their ownership and a number of government officials and intellectuals chose to start their own business. These <b>restructured</b> state-owned <b>enterprises,</b> government officials, and intellectuals became part of private businesses with original party membership. Thus, the fact that a high proportion of private entrepreneurs are party members is in a sense the result of the <b>restructuring</b> of state-owned <b>enterprises</b> as well as government officials (Dickson 2003, 2008; Tsai 2007). As a gathering place of private businesses, Wenzhou is especially pronounced in terms of these two aspects. For example, although Wenzhou has very few state-owned <b>enterprises,</b> <b>restructuring</b> of state-owned business is not a major factor; however, since 1992, the phenomena of government officials transforming into businessmen, “nonstate party organization establishment,” and “red CEO” recruitment in Wenzhou have had demonstrative effects for the whole country.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore, from the {{political}} economy perspective, public policy towards <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> in Serbia in the post-Milosevic period, including incentives to decision-makers for such a policy, its achievements, and dynamics. Also, it empirically tests the conventional wisdom in Serbia that economic issues, such as employment and real wages, are dominant factors for voters in deciding whether to vote for pro-reform or anti-reform political parties. Conventional models of voting behavior that stress economic variables find strong support in both theoretical and empirical literature. By regressing election results from 150 municipalities on various economic, social and demographic variables, we distinguish whether and to what extent <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring</b> and, more broadly, economic transition, influences voting behavior in Serbia. We find that economic variables are mostly statistically insignificant, but that employment in failed companies did influence voting behavior in 2000 and 2007. However, increased support for antireform parties over the same period can not be explained by <b>enterprise</b> <b>restructuring.</b> We offer potential explanations for these observations.
