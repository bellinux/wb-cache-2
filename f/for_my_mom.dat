I can recall having a white cast and bandage; it was gigantic! They tried to sew it on, but it didn't take, so I grew up with nine fingers.

Since the album sold half a million units throughout Latin America, Trevi realized that her next release had {{to be better than}} the previous one, so she took the time to choose and write about many issues. Gloria was recorded in London, Los Angeles, New York City, Miami and Mexico under the guidance of Armando Avila and Sebastián Jácome. The singer declared that the album is dedicated to women, since [...] "the girls are the ones who buy albums. If there comes a handsome guy and sings to us something that touches our heart is cool, but it is harder for a woman to understand another woman".

Then they would take me in their car, and while they were driving us to the prom, the mother would say, “Mike, did you know that Gloria plays the violin?” And I would say, “Really?” and she would say, “Yes, would you like to hear her play some time?” And I’d say, “Sure,” and she would pull a violin out from under the seat of the car and hand it to Gloria and Gloria would then proceed to play the violin for me {{all the way to the}} prom.

40|$|Phyllosilicates are {{commonly}} found in meteorites. A product of aqueous alteration, phyllosilicates have unique emission features in the mid-infrared. In order to determine if these features can be detected in extrasolar protoplanetary disks with instruments such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, disk emission was modeled using simple radiative transfer. In so doing, {{it was found that}} the most prominent phyllosilicate features can be detected. Comparisons of the disk emission model with and without the inclusion of 3 % phyllosilicates in the dust mixture are presented. The zodiacal dust in our Solar System has been modeled by including 20 % montmorillonite, a phyllosilicate. Detection of phyllosilicates in extra-solar protoplanetary disks, indicates the presence of liquid water, and would demonstrate a similarity of those disks to our Solar System. Non-detection would place a meaningful upper limit on the abundance of phyllosilicates and would imply that those systems are fundamentally different than our own. iii <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>mom</b> [...] .

40|$|Transient power {{dissipation}} profiles in handheld electronic devices alternate {{between high and}} low power states depending on usage. Capacitive thermal management based on phase change materials potentially offers a fan-less thermal management for such transient profiles. However, such capacitive management becomes feasible only if there is a significant enhancement in the enthalpy change per unit volume of the phase change material since existing bulk materials such as paraffin fall short of requirements. In this thesis I propose novel nanostructured thin-film materials that can potentially exhibit significantly enhanced volumetric enthalpy change. Using fundamental thermodynamics of phase transition, calculations regarding the enhancement resulting from superheating in such thin film systems is conducted. Furthermore design of a microfabricated calorimeter to measure such enhancements is explained in detail. This work advances the state-of-art of phase change materials for capacitive cooling of handheld devices. ii This one is <b>for</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>mom,</b> dad and sister. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

This research was designed as an experimental where the purpose was to find out the effectiveness of using songs as a tool in teaching listening to the students. This research was conducted at SMPN 3 Rambah and the number of the samples used were 19 students.

The result can be seen that students 2 ̆ 7 average score in pre-test was 30, 35 and students 2 ̆ 7 average score in post-test was 66.
