Since the element [...] "remembers" [...] the amount of current that last passed through, it was tagged by Chua with the name [...] "memristor". Another way of describing a memristor is as any passive two-terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of current (called charge) and the time integral of voltage (often called flux, as it is related to magnetic flux). The slope of this function is called the memristance M and is similar to variable resistance.|$|E

5000|$|Like the transistor, the memistor is a 3-terminal element. The {{conductance}} {{between two}} of the terminals is controlled by the time integral of the current in the third, rather than its <b>instantaneous</b> <b>value</b> as in the transistor. Reproducible elements have been made which are continuously variable (thousands of possible analog storage levels), and which typically vary in resistance from 100 ohms to 1 ohm, and cover this range in about 10 seconds with several milliamperes of plating current. Adaptation is accomplished by direct current while sensing the neuron logical structure is accomplished nondestructively by passing alternating currents through the arrays of memistor cells.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} way of {{creating}} the PWM signal {{is to use a}} high speed comparator ("C" [...] in the block-diagram above) that compares a high frequency triangular wave with the audio input. This generates a series of pulses of which the duty cycle is directly proportional with the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>value</b> of the audio signal. The comparator then drives a MOS gate driver which in turn drives a pair of high-power switches (usually MOSFETs). This produces an amplified replica of the comparator's PWM signal. The output filter removes the high-frequency switching components of the PWM signal and recovers the audio information that the speaker can use.|$|E

Another way of describing a memristor is as any passive two-terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of current (called charge) and the time integral of voltage (often called flux, as it is related to magnetic flux).

50|$|Quadracs {{are used}} in {{lighting}} control, speed control, and temperature modulation control applications. They carry performance specifications such as peak repetitive off voltage, peak repetitive reverse voltage, root mean square (RMS) on-state current, and temperature junction. Peak repetitive off voltage is the maximum, <b>instantaneous</b> <b>value</b> of the off-state voltage that occurs across a thyristor, including all repetitive transient voltages and excluding all non-transient voltages. Peak repetitive reverse voltage is the maximum peak reverse voltage that may be applied continuously to the main terminals (anode and cathode) of quadracs. RMS on-state current is the maximum RMS current allowed for the specified use-case temperature. Temperature junction for quadracs is expressed as a full-required range.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of exceedance {{is the number}} of times a stochastic process exceeds some critical value, usually a critical value far from the process' mean, per unit time. Counting exceedance of the critical value can be accomplished either by counting peaks of the process that exceed the critical value or by counting upcrossings of the critical value, where an upcrossing is an event where the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>value</b> of the process crosses the critical value with positive slope. This article assumes the two methods of counting exceedance are equivalent and that the process has one upcrossing and one peak per exceedance. However, processes, especially continuous processes with high frequency components to their power spectral densities, may have multiple upcrossings or multiple peaks in rapid succession before the process reverts to its mean.|$|E
5000|$|In orbital mechanics, mean motion (represented by n) is {{the angular}} speed {{required}} for a body to complete one orbit, assuming constant speed in a circular orbit which completes {{in the same time}} as the variable speed, elliptical orbit of the actual body. [...] The concept applies equally well to a small body revolving about a large, massive primary body or to two relatively same-sized bodies revolving about a common center of mass. While nominally a mean, and theoretically so in the case of two-body motion, in practice the mean motion is not typically an average over time for the orbits of real bodies, which only approximate the two-body assumption. It is rather the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>value</b> which satisfies the above conditions as calculated from the current gravitational and geometric circumstances of the body's constantly-changing, perturbed orbit.|$|E
