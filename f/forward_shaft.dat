5000|$|Foley and Woods {{have made}} several changes to Woods' swing since late 2010. Foley has taught Woods to stay more {{centered}} over {{the ball and}} increase weight {{on the left side}} through the downswing. Foley also teaches <b>forward</b> <b>shaft</b> lean at impact, which has resulted in Woods saying that he has gotten the distance back that he had earlier in his career. Woods' swing is now steeper than it was when he worked with previous instructor Hank Haney, and he no longer bows his left wrist {{at the top of the}} swing as much as he did before hiring Foley. Perhaps the most notable swing difference is that Woods is now a fade-biased golfer for the first time in his career. Woods and Foley worked on a more out-to-in swing path, trying to avoid coming from the inside and getting [...] "stuck," [...] which was an issue of Woods'. Woods had clear difficulty hitting draws in the earlier portion of this process, but began to work the ball both ways well in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{descriptors}} {{established a}} unique feature derived, or autapomorphy for this taxon: the back sheet of the ilium has {{only half the}} length of the main body. The ilium has a preserved length of sixty-two centimeter indicating a body length of about eight meters. The shaft of the buttock ends in a side view in large [...] "foot" [...] the tip of which points obliquely downwards and <b>forwards.</b> The <b>shaft</b> is much higher than transverse width.|$|R

5000|$|The {{main clutch}} is multiple-disc type with metal to metal {{friction}} surfaces running in oil. The change-speed gear is designed on [...] "Mercedes" [...] lines using ball-bearings {{and it provides}} four <b>forward</b> speeds. Each <b>shaft</b> has three bearings. The sliding portion of the mechanism is enclosed. There is no joint that can leak.|$|R
5000|$|In 1822, Mordan and his {{co-inventor}} John Isaac Hawkins {{filed the}} first patent in Great Britain for a metal pencil with an internal mechanism for propelling the graphite [...] "lead" [...] <b>shaft</b> <b>forward</b> during use, as an improvement on the less complex leadholders that merely clutched the pencil lead {{to hold it}} into a single position.|$|R
50|$|By March 1906, {{the company}} was {{advertising}} a 40-horsepower Touring Car in a national trade magazine for US$3,000. It had a 4-cylinder engine and was water-cooled with sliding-gear transmission and D.W.F. ball bearings, 3-speeds <b>forward</b> and reverse, <b>shaft</b> drive, spark and throttle on sector within wheel and foot accelerator. It also had a 109 in wheelbase and a heavy nickel steel crankshaft.|$|R
5000|$|When a horse, mule, {{or other}} animal is in harness, harness {{breeching}} (also known as full breeching) helps the animal to slow or control the forward movement of a vehicle. Animal-drawn vehicles have either {{a pair of}} shafts or a single pole projecting forwards for {{about the length of}} one animal. An animal between shafts wears harness breeching, which attaches <b>forward</b> to the <b>shafts.</b> As the animal slows, the vehicle runs <b>forward,</b> and the <b>shafts</b> pull the breeching forward against the haunches of the animal, which can thus slow the vehicle. A vehicle with a pole has a pair of animals either side of it [...] - [...] their breeching works in a similar way, attaching forward to the pole either directly or by way of their collars. In a larger team, the leaders are in front of the shafts or pole and thus cannot slow the vehicle; nevertheless, they sometimes wear breeching for show.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{example of}} the {{turboshaft}} principle is the Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-600 turbofan engine for the STOVL F-35B - in conventional mode it operates as a turbofan, but when powering the LiftFan, it switches partially to turboshaft mode to send 29,000 horsepower <b>forward</b> through a <b>shaft</b> (like a turboprop) and partially to turbofan mode to continue to send thrust to the main engine's fan and rear nozzle.|$|R
60|$|One {{by one the}} archers, {{stepping}} <b>forward,</b> delivered their <b>shafts</b> yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession, ten {{were fixed}} in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that, considering {{the distance of the}} mark, it was accounted good archery. Of the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly pronounced victorious.|$|R
60|$|During this {{conversation}} Dora had said nothing. Now {{as she stood}} by the old gig, toppling <b>forward</b> with its <b>shafts</b> resting upon the floor, {{she thought she had}} never seen such a horrible, antediluvian old trap in her life. Nothing could add so much to her disappointment in going so soon, as going in that thing. If there had been anything to say which might prevent her brother from carrying out his intention, she would have said it, but so far there had been nothing.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for NASA Glenn Research Center under contract NNC 10 BA 05 B, Task NNC 11 TA 80 T to identify beneficial arrangements of the turboshaft engine, transmissions and related systems within the propulsion pod nacelle of NASA's Large Civil Tilt-Rotor 2 nd iteration (LCTR 2) vehicle. Propulsion pod layouts were used to investigate potential advantages, disadvantages, as well as constraints of various arrangements assuming front or aft shafted engines. Results from previous NASA LCTR 2 propulsion system studies and tasks performed by Boeing under NASA contracts are {{used as the basis}} for this study. This configuration consists of two Fixed Geometry Variable Speed Power Turbine Engines and related drive and rotor systems (per nacelle) arranged in tilting nacelles near the wing tip. Entry-into-service (EIS) 2035 technology is assumed for both the engine and drive systems. The variable speed rotor system changes from 100 percent speed for hover to 54 percent speed for cruise by the means of a two speed gearbox concept developed under previous NASA contracts. Propulsion and drive system configurations that resulted in minimum vehicle gross weight were identified in previous work and used here. Results reported in this study illustrate that a <b>forward</b> <b>shafted</b> engine has a slight weight benefit over an aft shafted engine for the LCTR 2 vehicle. Although the aft shafted engines provide a more controlled and centered CG (between hover and cruise), the length of the long rotor shaft and complicated engine exhaust arrangement outweighed the potential benefits. A Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) approach for transmission sizing was also explored for this study. This tool offers quick analysis of gear loads, bearing lives, efficiencies, etc., through use of commercially available RomaxDESIGNER software. The goal was to create quick methods to explore various concept models. The output results from RomaxDESIGNER have been successfully linked to Boeing spreadsheets that generate gear tooth geometry in Catia 3 D environment. Another initial goal was to link information from RomaxDESIGNER (such as hp, rpm, gear ratio) to populate Boeing's parametric weight spreadsheet and create an automated method to estimate drive system weight. This was only partially achieved due to the variety of weight models, number of manual inputs, and qualitative assessments required. A simplified weight spreadsheet was used with data inputs from RomaxDESIGNER along with manual inputs to perform rough weight calculations...|$|R
60|$|Scenes {{similar to}} this were being enacted all over the plain, with this difference, that the bad or {{impatient}} men sometimes fired too soon and missed their mark, or by only wounding the animals, infuriated them and caused them to run faster. One or two ill-trained horses shied when the guns were fired, and left their riders sprawling on the ground. Others stumbled into badger-holes and rolled over. The Indians did their work well. They were used to it, and did not bend their bows until their horses almost brushed the reeking sides of the huge brutes. Then they drew to the arrow heads, and, leaning <b>forward,</b> buried the <b>shafts</b> up to the feathers. The arrow {{is said to be}} even more deadly than the bullet.|$|R

40|$|Manual {{jackscrew}} is a {{lifting device}} used by automobile drivers when any disorders occur, {{especially when the}} automobile tires are deflated. Considering manual jackscrew shape and design, not all {{people are able to}} use it easily, especially women. This is the reason of manual jackscrew modification into electric jackscrew. This jackscrew modification is conducted by adding a gearbox and DC motor. The ratio between gearbox input and output is 1 : 44. 77 and the DC motor power is 160 Watt – 600 Watt. The electric jackscrew working principle is that rotation from DC motor is reduced by the gearbox and <b>forwarded</b> to screw <b>shaft</b> in the jackscrew. The power source is from the automobile battery. The results of electric jackscrew testing show that time of jacking is 10 seconds for tricycle motorbike, 12 seconds for Gran Max PU car, and 14 seconds for Mazda Vantrend car,all the data is compared with the data manual jackscrew...|$|R

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{propelled}} by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding Parsons single reduction geared turbines, which supplied [...] {{to the four}} propeller shafts. Unlike the first five Leanders, which had their machinery arranged on the [...] "in-line" [...] principle (consisting of six boilers in three compartments forward, and four turbines in two further compartments aft), Sydney was designed with two redundant machinery groups, a design practice adopted from the United States Navy. The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer <b>shafts</b> <b>forward,</b> and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine, the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged. Each space had its own uptake, giving the modified ships a different profile to the single-funnelled early Leanders; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton's description of the Modified Leanders as [...] "the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy, with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the extreme}} {{roughness}} of the walking confined us in common practice to the platform, and indeed to {{those parts of}} it that were most easily accessible {{along the line of}} rails. The rails came straight <b>forward</b> from the <b>shaft,</b> here and there overgrown with little green bushes, but still entire, and still carrying a truck, which it was Lloyd's delight to trundle to and fro by the hour with various ladings. About midway down the platform, the railroad trended to the right, leaving our house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the madronas and the forge, and not far off the latter, ended in a sort of platform {{on the edge of the}} dump. There, in old days, the trucks were tipped, and their load sent thundering down the chute. There, besides, was the only spot where we could approach the margin of the dump. Anywhere else, you took your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a half to peer over. For at any moment the dump might begin to slide and carry you down and bury you below its ruins. Indeed, the neighbourhood of an old mine is a place beset with dangers. For as still as Silverado was, at any moment the report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen into the shaft; the dump might begin to pour into the road below; or a wedge slip in the great upright seam, and hundreds of tons of mountain bury the scene of our encampment.|$|R
40|$|The golf stroke was {{computationally}} modelled using {{finite element}} analysis. Results for the impact between the club {{head and the}} ball compared well with previous research, both practical and theoretical. The results imply that for thick face club heads, such as irons, club head performance is independent of material stiffness but highly dependent on the friction of the interface and the clubhead geometry. The three ball flight predictors (speed, trajectory and spin rate) {{as a function of}} clubhead parameters are shown to be non-trivial. Acceptable models of impact could be achieved using rigid faces for thick face clubheads with the centre of mass and clubhead inertia accurately described. Results on ball construction effects imply that both the stiffness and mass distribution throughout the ball affect performance. The large deformations of the ball mean that classic rigid body mechanics cannot suffice in golf impact predictions. A model of the golf swing based on a double pendulum was constructed and shaft performance examined for various styles of golf swing. Shaft parameters thought to affect performance were quantitatively evaluated and results compared well with previous research. Increased club head speeds at impact were achieved with shafts of lighter weight or reduced bending stiffness for all styles of golf swing examined. The cause of bending <b>forward</b> of the <b>shaft</b> at impact was identified to occur from the large centrifugal forces acting on the head and the increased bending stiffness of the shaft also due to centrifugal force. On a detailed level shaft behaviour was affected by vibrations which appeared chaotic due to the changing stiffness of the system. This is expected to be less of an effect in an actual golf shot due to the damping provided by the human participant...|$|R

His wagons {{had begun}} the night before; and went all night, {{rumbling}} continuous (Anonymous of Prag [Second [...] "LETTER from a Citizen, &c." [...] (date, 27th November, see supra, p. 348), in Helden-Geschichte, ii. 1181-1188.] hearing them well), through the Karlthor, northwest gate of Prag, across the Moldau Rridge. All night across that bridge,--Leitmeritz road, great road to the northwest:--followed finally by the march of horse and foot. But news had already fled abroad. Five hundred Pandours were in the City, backed by the Butchers' lads and other riotous GESINDEL, before the rear-guard got away. Sad tugging and wriggling in consequence, much firing from windows, and uproarious chaos;--so that Rothenburg had at last to remount a couple of guns, and blow it off with case-shot. A drilled Prussian rear-guard struggling, with stern composure, through a real bit of burning chaos. With effect, though not without difficulty. Here is the scene on the Noldau Bridge, and past that high Hradschin [Old Palace of the Bohemian Kings (pronounce RADsheen); one of the steepest Royal Sites in the world.] mass of buildings; all Prag, not the Hradschin only, struggling to give us fatal farewell if it durst. River is covered with Pandours firing out of boats; Bridge encumbered to impassability by forsaken wagons, the drivers of which had cut traces and run; shot comes overhead from the Hradschin on our left, much shot, infinite tumult all round; thoroughfare impossible for two-wheeled vehicle, or men in rank. 'Halt!' cries Colonel Brandes, who has charge of the thing; divides them in three: 'First one party, deal with these river-boats, that Pandour doggery; second party, pull these stray wagons to right and left, making the way clear; third party, drag our own wagons <b>forward,</b> shoulder to <b>shaft,</b> and yoke them out of shot-range;--you, Captain Carlowitz,' and calls twenty volunteers to go with Carlowitz, and drag their own cannon, 'step you forward, keep the gate of that Hradschin till we all pass!' In this manner, rapid, hard of stroke, clear-headed and with stern regularity, drilled talent gets the burning Nessus'-shirt wriggled off; and tramps successfully forth with its baggages. About 11 A.M., this rearguard of Brandes's did; should have been at seven,--right well {{that it could be}} at all.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} {{materials in}} sensors and transducers are growing rapidly. This material {{can be applied}} in many ways. One of Piezoelectric material founded in market was sheet- shaped called PVDF film. PVDF film applications in sensors allow the use in many application. In this study, PVDF film is used as the liquid viscosity sensor using the principle of concentric cylinders. This research aims to design a sensor with a mechanical sensor {{that can be used}} for viscosity. In this study, the mechanical and electrical parts of the sensor was designed so that it can be used as a viscosity sensor. The design begins with designing the mechanical sensor consisting of a cylinder with diameter of 3 cm which at the upper end of the shaft mounted a circular plate as a place to attach the PVDF film sensor. This cylinder will be immersed in the outer cylider of 5 cm in diameter filled with test fluid. This outer tube is rotated so that the liquid then follow to spin, the test fluid spin will be rubbing against the cylinder resulting a force and torque on the cylinder. This force will be <b>forwarded</b> to the <b>shaft</b> and up to the plate that has been attached PVDF film. Due to this force, the PVDF electrode charge will arise. This charge by a charge amplifier is converted into a voltage proportional to the force felt by the inner cylinder. Viscosity will affect the force that drive PVDF film so that by measuring the output voltage will obtain the viscosity of the test fluid. Research was done by taking 10 samples of oil and 3 different size ofPVDF film and a strain gage,that are: 1 cm x 3 cm (PVDF 1); 1 cm x 2 cm (PVDF 2); 1 cm x 1 cm (PVDF 3). Results showed that the resolution of PVDF 1, PVDF 2 and PVDF 3 are 4. 6 mv/cPois; 3. 1 mv/cPois and 1. 5 mv/cPois respectively, while the strain gage produce a resolution of 1. 2 mv/cPois. The average resolution of PVDF is 1. 53 mv. cPois- 1. cm- 2, which means that every 1 cm 2 PVDF film area and the increase of 1 cPois of viscosity of the material will produce 1. 53 millivolts...|$|R
5000|$|The {{plane was}} {{conceived}} as a fast light bomber and reconnaissance plane. To obtain high speed and good aerodynamics, it was powered by two M-103 inline engines in tandem in a fuselage nose, driving two contra-rotating coaxial three-blade propellers. The design had quite unusual look, with long fuselage nose and a crew cab moved rearwards, towards double tailfin. Wings had a fighter-like form and their span was rather short. The VVIA under Bolkhovitinov was enlarged to tackle the expected problems {{in the design of}} the Bolkhovitnov S. The rear engine was geared to two high-speed shafts which passed either side of the forward engine to drive the rear propeller gearbox, whilst the forward engine and gearbox drove the <b>forward</b> propeller via <b>shaft</b> through the middle of the rear propeller gearbox. The structure of the S was predominantly light alloy stressed skin, the wing having two spars with heavy flush-rivetted upper and lower skins, and the fuselage built up from pre-formed upper, lower, and side panels attached to four longerons to give a strong but relatively simple structure to build. A total of 29 electrical actuators drove the Fowler Flaps, undercarriage, (rotating 90deg to lie flat in the wing), exit flap of the large common radiator duct, and many other services. The tail unit consisted of twin fins with rudders attached to the tips of the tailplane, variable geared elevators and separate servo and trim tabs on elevators, and rudders. Detail design of the aircraft began in 1937 and construction in July [...] The first prototype S-1 was built in 1939, but it was made in order to evaluate an airframe only and therefore was powered by only one engine M-103. It was unarmed and fitted with a fixed skid landing gear. It first flew on January 29, 1940, with B.N. Kudrin at the controls. A maximum speed was 400 km/h. The second prototype S-2 was powered by two engines and was armed with a single machinegun and bombs. Four 100 kg bombs were carried vertically in a bay between pilot and a rear gunner-navigator, under a common canopy. Its state testing started from March 20, 1940, and lasted until July 1940. A maximum speed reached was 570 km/h (354 mph). The plane had good handling, except for take-off and landing, which were difficult due to high wing loading. Its range and speed were also lower than estimated. As a result, it was decided to improve the plane further. However, the plane was not developed in a favour of next Bolkhovitinov designs.|$|R
