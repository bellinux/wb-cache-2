The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence.

25|$|Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court, relying on Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, held that to {{establish}} standing under the civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision that creates a civil cause of action for any person or entity injured in their business or property by reason of a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she was the <b>direct</b> <b>victim</b> of the defendant's RICO violation (e.g., a business may not sue a competitor that may have gained a competitive advantage by not paying taxes). The Court explained that this construction will save district courts from the difficulty of determining an indirect victim's damages caused by attenuated conduct.|$|E
25|$|On December 12, 2005, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams, another {{civil suit}} brought under section 1964(c) of RICO. In this case, {{employees}} alleged that their employer, Mohawk Industries (Mohawk), violated RICO by knowingly employing illegal immigrants {{with the help}} of third party employment agencies. The larger job pool enabled Mohawk to lower the wages of its legal employees and thereby reduce its labor costs. The Supreme Court, on the same day as its decision in Ideal, issued a brief order stating that certiorari had been granted improvidently and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for consideration in light of its decision in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. Under the Ideal rationale, {{it would appear that the}} <b>direct</b> <b>victim</b> of Mohawk's RICO violations was the federal government, not Mohawk's employees. Therefore, Ideal may pose a problem to the plaintiffs' case in Mohawk.|$|E

Self-report data came from a community-based sample of 3, 007 adolescents {{with an average age}} of 14. 6 years and comprising 53 % boys. Compared to <b>direct</b> <b>victims</b> of an MVA in which someone was injured, witnesses of MVAs with injury reported significantly less internalizing symptoms, such as symptoms of posttraumatic stress (d = 0. 25), fear (d = 0. 21), and depression (d = 0. 17). Compared to adolescents who were never exposed to an MVA with injury, witnesses reported significantly more externalizing symptoms (d = 0. 24). In multiple regression analyses the significant difference between witnesses and victims disappeared when sex, other stressful events, appraisals, and coping were added to the model.

While the Court recognized Ideal may have been harmed by National's lower prices, this harm was caused by actions entirely distinct from the alleged actions constituting the RICO violation (the fraudulent tax reports). The Court also noted that although the attenuation between Ideal's harms and the claimed RICO violation arose from a different source than in Holmes (where the alleged violations were linked to the plaintiff's alleged harm only through a third party), the absence of proximate causation was equally clear in both cases.

60|$|Jacob Kent {{was feeling}} {{particularly}} good that afternoon. The record {{had been broken}} the previous night, and he had sold his hospitality to no less than twenty-eight visitors. True, it had been quite uncomfortable, and four had snored beneath his bunk all night; but then it had added appreciable weight to the sack in which he kept his gold dust. That sack, with its glittering yellow treasure, was at once the chief delight and the chief bane of his existence. Heaven and hell lay within its slender mouth. In the nature of things, there being no privacy to his one-roomed dwelling, he was tortured by a constant fear of theft. It would be very easy for these bearded, desperate-looking strangers to make away with it. Often he dreamed that such was the case, and awoke {{in the grip of}} nightmare. A select number of these robbers haunted him through his dreams, and he came to know them quite well, especially the bronzed leader with the gash on his right cheek. This fellow was the most persistent of the lot, and, because of him, he had, in his waking moments, constructed several score of hiding-places in and about the cabin. After a concealment he would breathe freely again, perhaps for several nights, only to collar the Man with the Gash in the very act of unearthing the sack. Then, on awakening {{in the midst of the}} usual struggle, he would at once get up and transfer the bag to a new and more ingenious crypt. It was not that he was the <b>direct</b> <b>victim</b> of these phantasms; but he believed in omens and thought-transference, and he deemed these dream-robbers to be the astral projection of real personages who happened at those particular moments, no matter where they were in the flesh, to be harboring designs, in the spirit, upon his wealth. So he continued to bleed the unfortunates who crossed his threshold, and at the same time to add to his trouble with every ounce that went into the sack.|$|E

Results A total of 567 reports were identified, 11 of which were eligible for this review: 6 carried out with <b>direct</b> <b>victims,</b> 4 with persons in general population, and 1 with victims and general population. The reviewed literature suggests that the risk of MDD ranges between 20 and 30 % in <b>direct</b> <b>victims</b> and between 4 and 10 % in the general population in the first few months after terrorist attacks. Characteristics that tend to increase risk of MDD after a terrorist attack are female gender, having experienced more stressful situations before or after the attack, peritraumatic reactions during the attack, loss of psychosocial resources, and low social support. The course of MDD after terrorist attacks is less clear due to the scarcity of longitudinal studies. Conclusions Methodological limitations in the literature of this field are considered and potentially important areas for future research such as the assessment of the course of MDD, the study of correlates of MDD or the comorbidity between MDD and other mental health problems are discussed. </p...|$|R

In any emergency situation, there are two type of victims: <b>direct</b> <b>victims</b> and indirect victims. Both will have their current plans disrupted {{in order to deal}} with the emergency. Federal, State, and Local governments have established a 911 system to assist <b>direct</b> <b>victims.</b> However, there is still lack of assistance provided to the indirect victims. In this paper, we propose a Navigation Assistance Framework that allows emergency organizations to provide emergency information that can assist victims navigating out of the emergency area and reaching their intended destinations in a reasonable amount of time. We develop an emergency prototype ERSimMon to simulate this capability in a small scale to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution. In addition, we develop the Emergency Response Application (ERApp) for a smart phone platform, which intercepts the enhanced Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) broadcast message, displays the user’s location with respect to the emergency location on the map and provides navigational assistance and recommend actions to help the user navigate out of ongoing emergencies.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the sentence of reparation in New Zealand, as set out by s 32 of the Sentencing Act 2002. The scope of the sentence is examined with particular regard to the recent Supreme Court decision, which limited reparation so that only victims of offences can benefit from the sentence. The definition of “victim”, {{as determined by the}} Sentencing Act, is confined to <b>direct</b> <b>victims</b> of criminal offending. Thus, any indirect victim suffering harm or loss from criminal offending cannot benefit from reparation. This paper questions whether that limitation gives reparation an appropriate scope, or whether some extension should be made so that the sentence is not restricted in its application to only benefit <b>direct</b> <b>victims.</b> In so doing, this paper argues that the criminal law is the suitable domain to address such issues of compensation and therefore, an extension of the reparation sentence is required. Alternative ways of limiting reparation to address this compensation issue are outlined. Ultimately it is proposed that an additional provision should be included within the definition of “victim”, for the purpose of s 32, so that indirect victims can also benefit from a sentence of reparation...|$|R
