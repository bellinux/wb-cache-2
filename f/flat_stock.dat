50|$|Modern forge-welding {{is often}} automated, using computers, machines, and {{sophisticated}} hydraulic-presses {{to produce a}} variety of products {{from a number of}} various alloys. For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. <b>Flat</b> <b>stock</b> is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam. Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together. Other methods include flash welding and percussion welding. These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the weld. Shielded active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.|$|E

According to one of the slides, creep forming would be an intermediate step in a process that would yield a fully densified, finished C-CMC part having a desired size and shape (the other steps would include preliminary machining, finish machining, densification by chemical vapor infiltration, and final coating). The investigation included experiments in which C-CMC disks were creep-formed by heating them to unspecified high temperatures for time intervals of the order of 1 hour while they were clamped into single- and double-curvature graphite molds.

40|$|This {{research}} studies some {{issues related to}} approximate surface development. Two related problems are also explored as described below. The main work here {{is the development of}} an iterative algorithm for generating 2 D 'flattenedâ€™ patterns equivalent to a 3 D shape that possibly has non-zero Gaussian curvature. The equivalence here is meant in terms of minimization of the strain energy. The model used incorporates approximated solid mechanics to compute the strain and the strain energy of the surface. The principal strain directions are used to guide the flattening algorithm. The method yields some advantages over the ones reported in recent research since it uses a more accurate energy model, and searches for energy minimization over a continuous domain (instead of taking discrete steps). We also explore how to arrange a developed pattern onto a raw stock (sheet) of anisotropic properties, so as to minimize the strain energy. This has applications in engineering where raw material patterns are cut out of <b>flat</b> <b>stocks,</b> and then 'drapedâ€™ or forced on top of moulds to form curved surfaces, as in footwear manufacturing. The second problem we study is the draping of a 2 D pattern of polygonal shape onto a given 3 D curved surface. A new method using geodesic curves is explored for this problem. A major difference between the methods of this work with many of the past works is that we do not allow any darts or gussets in the developments. This is consistent with our major application area, which is footwear design. The techniques developed in this research have direct application in this industry, which is an important sector in Hong Kong manufacturing [...] HK is the third largest exporter of leather goods in the world...|$|R

40|$|The use of strain-isolated ceramic coated {{material}} {{to produce an}} AGT 1500 combustor scroll-shaped transition duct which requires no air for film cooling is investigated. The scroll receives the exhaust of the can-style combustor liner and turns it into the annular inlet of the high pressure gas producer turbine nozzle. Strain-isolation of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating is achieved by placing a compliant pad between the structural base metal and the ceramic coating. The compliant pad is brazed to the metal structure. In order to achieve a good braze bond, the strain-isolating compliant pad and base metal must be closely matched in shape and tightly fixtured for joining. The complex geometry of the AGT 1500 scroll makes it impractical to attack pads to the supporting structure in its finished shape. Instead the pads are brazed to <b>flat</b> <b>stock</b> and post-formed into scroll sections. While test samples were successfully post-formed, plasma sprayed, and subjected to cyclic heating, the forming of full scale parts by normal methods resulted in tearing of the Hastelloy-X base metal because of embrittlement by the braze material. Several solutions were explored which finally resulted in the successful forming of full scale scroll parts...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 41) 6061 aluminum is a precipitation hardenable alloy that is {{used extensively}} in structural applications. Large ring shaped parts fabricated from 6061 are often rolled from annealed <b>flat</b> <b>stock.</b> A welding operation is required to join {{the ends of the}} part after shaping. The part is then precipitation hardened to bring the 6061 alloy up to the T 6 condition. Unfortunately, the weld metals commonly used to join 6061 do not achieve the same hardness as the parent metal in the T 6 condition. In this study the effects of weld rod type, welding procedure, and postweld heat treatments were examined. Four different weld rods were used to join 6061 samples. The welding was done with and without a water chi lied fixture attached to the specimens being welded. Welded specimens were aged using ten different heat treatment cycles that included 9900 F or 9700 F solution treatments and natural or artificial aging at 3200 F or 3500 F. The 6061 parent material relies on a Magnesium Silicide precipitate for hardening effects. Three of the weld rods used, (X 4643, 5356, & 5556), have similar AI-Mg-Si alloy constituents. The fourth rod, 4043, is a AI-Si alloy. The X 4643 weld rod was the only weld alloy to match the T 6 condition of the 6061 parent metal after aging. This occurred only in the water chilled case where the chill minimizes melting of the parent material during the welding process and increases the solidification rate of the weld metal. The appearant effect of the chill is to promote a finer dendritic structure...|$|E
40|$|Yield locus {{measurements}} and their analytical descriptions {{has been the}} bases for modeling metal processing. These analytical descriptions {{play a role in}} models to predict limit strains observed during determination of forming limit diagrams of <b>flat</b> metal <b>stock</b> as means to evaluate their fabrication performance. Some of these analytical descriptions use the isotropic or anisotropic plastic potentials that take into account the crystallographic texture of the material. The applicability of such potentials is validated by comparing their predictions to that of unidirectional tensile data. In the current work, this approach is reversed to examine whether the constitutive relations, which replicate the measured stress strain diagrams, can generate a two-dimensional section of the yield locus. The strategy is to sum the computed plastic work (PW) from unidirectional mechanical tests in two principal directions which also accommodates the biaxial interaction strains. The resulting yield function includes fq and f 4, the prescribed stress ratios and the texture parameters R 4 and Rq in their respective principal directions. The prescribed PW at an arbitrary strain during unidirectional tensile test is equated to the work sum from the biaxial stresses on the premise that the plastic flow-stress registers only the increasing density of obstacles it generates. The computed biaxial yield stresses showed good fits for AA 5154 and AA 5754 with only small modification due to latent work hardening. status: publishe...|$|R

As eradication and treatment are not possible, the control of the disease mainly relies on transfer restriction. Moreover, selection has been applied to produce resistant flat oyster families, which present better survival and lower prevalence than non-selected oysters. In order to better understand the mechanisms involved in resistance to bonamiosis, cellular and molecular responses of 2 oyster groups (selected oysters and wild-type oysters) were analyzed in the context of experimental injection and cohabitation infections. Cellular responses including non-specific esterases detection, ROS production and phagocytosis activity were analyzed by flow cytometry. Four genes homologous to those shown to be involved in immunity were selected (Inhibitor of apotosis OeIAP, Fas ligand OeFas-ligand, Oe-SOD, and OeEc-SOD) and monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Infected oysters showed higher phagocytosis activity than controls. Infected selected oyster show a lower phagocytosis activity which might be a protection against {{the parasite}} infection. The expression of OeIAP and OeFas-ligand gene was significantly increased in selected oysters at 5 days post-injection.

The smile in {{observed}} Black-Scholes implied volatilities {{has often been}} attributed to deficiencies in the B-S model, such as the assumption of constant volatility, which cause the implied volatilities calculated using the B-S formula to differ from the true volatilities. If such deficiencies are the sole cause, then if the implied volatilities were calculated correctly (i. e., using the true though possibly unknown model), the smile should disappear or become <b>flat.</b> Using <b>stock</b> index options data, we test and reject {{the hypothesis that the}} true smile in stock index option prices is flat.

However, we find that such a delta-gamma neutral strategy yields substantial pre-transaction-cost profits. Moreover, the profits are large when the B-S model predicts large profits and small when small profits are predicted. Our results indicate that while part of the observed Black-Scholes smile appears due to deficiencies in the Black-Scholes model, a substantial part reflects a smile in the true implied volatilities.
