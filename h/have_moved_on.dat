25|$|If {{a single}} person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know {{on the same day}} whether their {{decision}} was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.|$|E

He was immediately asked to become Regent—that is, student-master—in the Collège de Montaigu, where he also began his (more advanced) studies in Theology. Soon afterwards, he visited a renowned Italian hermit who {{had been invited to}} France by the King, Charles VIII. This was St Francis of Paola, who had given up all possessions, (he had walked to France from Italy), including the personal use of money, and subjected himself to severe privations in terms of food, clothing, cleanliness, heat and bedding. Jan was tremendously struck by Francis's air of saintliness.|$|E
25|$|Manila Film Center: A major {{component}} of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the facility {{was the site of}} a construction accident in 1981. When construction of the building was rushed for a film festival, the ceiling scaffolding collapsed, killing several workmen. Rather than halt construction to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of the dead workmen, First Lady Imelda Marcos, the main financier of the project, was believed to have ordered cement to be poured into the orchestra, entombing the fallen workmen, some of whom were even buried alive. Various ghostly activities have been reported, including mysterious sounds, voices and poltergeist activity. In the late 1990s, a group called the Spirit Questors began to make visits to the film center, in an attempt to contact and appease the souls of the workmen who were killed in the building. Some of these spirits claimed to <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on,</b> but a few allegedly remain. The facility, formerly abandoned due to its reputation, is now in use after restoration works.|$|E

After the murder, Bree receives a blackmail letter from an unknown person {{similar to the one}} Mary Alice had received in the first season. Due to her relationship with detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake), Bree becomes the main character affected by the cover-up of Alejandro's murder, and is eventually accused of killing Alejandro herself. A new neighbor, Ben Faulkner (Charles Mesure), moves into the lane, attracting Renee along the way. Ben is going through severe financial problems, and resorts to a dangerous and unruly loan shark to bail him out. Mike meddles in the business of Ben's loan shark in an attempt to protect Renee, but he pays the ultimate price. During {{the first half of the}} season, Susan struggles with the guilt of her involvement in the Alejandro case, and during the second half, she tries to deal with both Julie's unexpected pregnancy and Mike's death. Following the cover-up of Alejandro's murder, Carlos develops an alcohol problem, but Gabrielle persuades him to recover in rehab, which eventually results in Gabrielle and Carlos switching house roles.

500|$|Smith's first {{television}} role was as Jim Taylor in the BBC adaptations of the Sally Lockhart quartet books The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North. His first major television role {{came in the}} television series Party Animals, a BBC television drama series about fictional parliamentary advisors and researchers in Westminster. In Party Animals, Smith portrays Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher to Jo Porter (Raquel Cassidy), a Labour politician and junior Home Office minister. At 26 years old, Danny is described as an intelligent but timid [...] "politics geek" [...] who should <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> from researching at his age. Within the series' narrative, he attempts to balance his affections for Kirsty MacKenzie (Andrea Riseborough), his intern, while trying to prevent Porter's imminent decline.|$|E
500|$|A 1985 Rolling Stone {{feature on}} the Minneapolis scene and {{innovative}} California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, [...] "Primal punk is passé. The {{best of the}} American punk rockers <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on.</b> They {{have learned how to}} play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead." [...] By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.|$|E

500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her third studio album Glassheart (2012). It was written by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and produced by Josh Abrahams, Ammo and Oligee. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles and is a power ballad, incorporating a piano and synth-driven melody. The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time has passed since their relationship for her to <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> and to have developed as a person. Critics praised Lewis' vocal performance, likening her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. The musical structure of the song was heavily compared {{to one of her}} previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", along with songs performed by Adele. The accompanying music video shows Lewis trying to escape from a giant bird cage.|$|E
500|$|Freeman was principally {{responsible}} {{for the establishment of}} structural biology as a discipline in Australia. [...] He founded the first protein crystallography laboratory in Australia; today, there are more than 15 active research groups carrying out protein crystallography in Australia and New Zealand. [...] Many former members of the Freeman research group <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to join one of these other groups. [...] The groups interact through the Society of Crystallographers of Australia and New Zealand (SCANZ); Freeman was the Foundation President of then Society of Crystallographers of Australia, an organisation he was instrumental in forming in 1976. [...] Working as a crystallographer, Freeman's major legacies are the understanding of plastocyanin and other blue copper proteins, and development of the MAD method as an extension of EXAFS spectroscopy. [...] Freeman's work in ensuring Australian scientists have access to [...] "big science" [...] facilities will continue to assist researchers into the future. [...] His teaching also leaves a legacy of [...] "generations of students imbued with a love of science".|$|E
500|$|Otaku {{is derived}} from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ( [...] otaku). This word is often used metaphorically, as an honorific second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal {{translation}} is [...] "you". For example, in the anime Macross, first aired in 1982, the character Lynn Minmay uses the term this way. The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in hiragana (おたく), katakana (オタク or, less frequently, ヲタク) or rarely in rōmaji, first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist Akio Nakamori. His 1983 series , printed in the lolicon magazine Manga Burikko, applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators Haruhiko Mikimoto and Shōji Kawamori had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s. Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans. Morikawa Kaichirō, an author and lecturer at Meiji University, identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.|$|E

500|$|The video also {{received}} comparisons to Spears' [...] "Criminal", which was released {{two days before}} [...] "We Found Love", on October 17, 2011. Critics noted that both videos were filmed in the United Kingdom and caused controversy there, both contain scenes of sex, violence, and crime, and both featured [...] "bad boy" [...] stereotypes and evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph of PopDust noted that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, {{regardless of whether they}} <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> from past situations, because the discussion about them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears nor Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to—their videos are much more effective than anything the singers could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly wrote that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment and that the villains in the video, Rihanna's boyfriend and Spears' policemen, are British, whereas Spears' savior in her video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to film their grittiest videos in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States. According to her, the videos continue with a tradition of xenophobic portrayals of British people as villains by American film and video directors.|$|E
500|$|St Asaph {{explained}} that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it. It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, {{and it does not}} matter if they themselves <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> from past situations, because the discussion around them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to: their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly also compared it to [...] "We Found Love", saying that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment. She wrote that all the villains in the video – her boyfriend and the policemen – are British, whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their [...] "grittiest videos" [...] in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States, that is also so against guns that politicians felt the need to talk about it. According to her, the videos continue with a xenophobic portrayal of British people as villains by American pop culture.|$|E
