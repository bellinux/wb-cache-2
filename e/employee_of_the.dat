5|$|Defense {{research}} activity {{supported by the}} Advanced Research Project Agency, Project BATON sought to expand understanding of storm physics {{as an aid to}} weather forecasting, fire prevention, and, possibly, for artificially controlling the weather.

40|$|Adopting an {{intergroup}} perspective, {{the research}} was designed to examine predictors <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> responses to an organizational merger. Data were collected from 120 <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a newly merged scientific organization. As predicted from social identity theory, the most negative responses to the merger were apparent among <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low status premerger organization. There was also evidence of ingroup bias among both groups <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> involved in <b>the</b> merger—as expected, the bias was most marked on the status-irrelevant dimensions for <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower status organization, but most marked on the status-relevant dimensions for <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high status organization. Also, in support of social identity theory, <b>the</b> perceived legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis for the status differentiation between the groups was associated with more positive responses to <b>the</b> merger among <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low status premerger organization, but with poorer responses among <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high status premerger organization.

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{also used}} {{the area around the}} Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners {{eventually}} reached the area in the 1870s-1890s, searching for resources and rich land.

5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Ohmsen {{initially}} {{worked as}} a government <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Schleswig-Holstein agricultural ministry. He ran for public office as a candidate of the Schleswig-Holstein-Block in the 1954 Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein election. During an election speech, he disparaged the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Friedrich-Wilhelm Lübke. Ohmsen was immediately dismissed without notice from his position in the agricultural ministry for insulting the Minister-President. He rejoined the military service of the Bundeswehr on 16 March 1956 as a Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) of the Bundesmarine (German Federal Navy). He was promoted to Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) on 15 November 1957 and Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) on 13 August 1965 and retired on 30 September 1967.|$|E
5|$|Bell {{was then}} an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia.

His father bailed {{him out of his}} deprivation, and he {{returned}} to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E

Drawing support from union <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indianapolis Street Railway Company, Thorpe began a campaign to unionize <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Traction and Terminal Company in August 1913. <b>The</b> 900 non-union <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Traction and Terminal Company were generally paid much less and worked longer hours than <b>the</b> union workers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller transportation company, and Thorpe considered them to be a prime target for the union organizing attempt.|$|R
5|$|Heaphy's {{contract}} with the company was for three years, primarily to create art {{that could be used}} as advertising for the company. In doing so he travelled extensively around the country and occasionally participated in overland treks, living out of a tent or staying with local Māori. He also sailed around parts of the country aboard the Tory and learned surveying from its captain. Another <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company travelling on the Tory was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.|$|E

5|$|Miller's {{research}} was assisted {{by a set}} of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of Scientology.

The Church of Scientology obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order.|$|E

5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{had created}} the {{national}} side's emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side's emblem. The white kit worn by the national team {{was taken from the}} kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier.|$|E
5|$|The agency's {{leadership}} was later reorganized. Soemanang became Antara's managing editor, and while Malik became his deputy. Malik, {{twenty years old}} at the time, was credited with keeping the agency alive in its early years by building a base of supporters in the emerging indigenous middle class. After Soemanang left Antara in 1938 to become the director of the Pergoeroean Rakjat network of schools, Sipahoetar was promoted to editor-in-chief, and Pandoe Kartawigoena became the agency's deputy editor-in-chief. Sipahoetar was later elevated to managing editor, but left the agency in 1939 because of an illness.
