5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> episode for several scenes {{in which the}} action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were short on time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
25|$|After Torque defeats the creature, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> murders, {{realizing that}} {{he was the one who}} killed his family; he smashed his wife's head in, drowned his {{youngest}} son, and threw his eldest son from the window. When the coast guard arrives, Torque transforms into his monster state and kills him, before running back into the woods of Carnate.|$|E

25|$|Born in Rabaul {{where his}} father was then stationed, Somare grew up in his family village of Karau in the Murik Lakes {{district}} of East Sepik Province. Somare's earliest education was in a Japanese-run primary school at Karau during World War II where he learned to read, write and count in Japanese. Meanwhile, Somare's father was in hiding and fear of his life from the Japanese in Rabaul, but <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> Japanese with affection. Somare's earliest overseas trips, first as a parliamentarian and then as Prime Minister, were to Japan.|$|E
25|$|Jaded {{with his}} new life, John moves to an {{abandoned}} hilltop tower, {{near the village of}} Puttenham, where he intends to adopt a solitary ascetic lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising self-flagellation. This soon draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, hoping to witness his bizarre behaviour; one of them is Lenina. At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with his whip. The onlookers are wildly aroused by the display and John is caught up in the crowd's soma-fueled frenzy. The next morning, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> previous night's events and is stricken with remorse. Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening discover John dead, having hanged himself.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E

25|$|Pitrājñāpālanam (Sanskrit: पित्राज्ञापालनम्). Jamadagni {{requests}} Paraśurāma {{to marry}} and enter {{the second stage of}} life, the Gārhasthya Āśrama ("householder's life"). Paraśurāma respectfully turns the request down, saying he wishes to be forever away from the bondage of family. One morning, Reṇukā goes to a lake to fetch water. There she sees the Gandharva king Citraratha, taking delight in the water of the lake with his wife. Reṇukā is attracted to Citraratha and returns home excited, fantasizing about him. Jamadagni senses this and orders his three elder sons to kill their mother who he says has become impure by her adulterous thoughts. When the brothers refuse to carry out his command, Jamadagni asks Paraśurāma to do the same. Paraśurāma is caught between the command of his father, and the indebtedness to mother – <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> Smṛti scriptures which says the mother is ten times the greater than the father. After a lot of thought and counter-thought, he decides to obey his father. Paraśurāma beheads his mother and three brothers. Jamadagni is pleased and offers Paraśurāma two wishes. Paraśurāma asks for the resurrection of all four as the first wish, and their loss of memory about their killing as the second one. Jamadagni grants both the wishes and Reṇukā and her three sons get up as if from sleep. Paraśurāma thus satisfies his father and also brings back his mother to life.|$|E
500|$|Lindblom {{credited}} Miura and the game's affirming [...] "tone" [...] as what {{helped him}} manage {{the magnitude of}} the project. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> game as [...] "very [...] " [...] and wrote it to be [...] "a glass half full kind of game". When asked of his favorite contribution to the final work, Lindblom remembered the character Pokey's mother, Lardna. He described the name choice as [...] "just the most ridiculous thing to have picked". Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan, an original reviewer, wrote that EarthBound was translated [...] "impeccably" [...] and praised the game's humor. In the period following its release, the game's English localization has found praise. Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as [...] "top-notch for its time". Kotaku found the localization [...] "funny, clever, and evocative".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the game, Naija {{discovers that}} all of the ruined civilizations she has found {{throughout}} the game were destroyed by a god, [...] "the Creator", who was jealous of the rising power of that civilization or of their gods. The powerful monsters she has found and defeated in each region were once the gods of that civilization. Each of these civilizations had a unique power, symbolized by the form that Naija learns after defeating their former gods. Along with Li, a human diver from the land she meets {{at the top of the}} ocean, Naija then descends to the bottom of the sea to confront the god. There she discovers that the Creator fell into the ocean as a child, and bonded with an ancient spirit to gain god-like powers. He then created Aquaria, threading a verse of a lullaby his mother had sung to him throughout, the only part of the song <b>he</b> <b>remembers.</b> <b>The</b> melody of this song, the [...] "verse", is what allows Naija to sing songs that affect the world around her; parts of the melody can be heard in different forms in the songs within the game's soundtrack.|$|E

Later, Michael meets with Emma's father Joaquin (Carlos Lacamara) at a coffee shop to discuss the new baby, the mystery man appears to let Michael know that he sees the real mystery man through the window and Michael chases after him. When a police artist (Chad Cleven) draws an image of the man, his real name is {{revealed}} to be Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), another detective who took over Michael's spot at the police department after the crash, now working with Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's former partner in the [...] "red reality" [...] and his current one in the [...] "green reality". Michael meets with Bird and Hawkins and the latter says {{that he was one of}} the first on the scene of the crash and that he is sorry about Rex's death. Michael starts to believe that his son is really dead; <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> crash, yet again, with additional information. Michael realizes that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the crash. As soon as he figures out the situation, Michael wakes up with Rex and Emma; he is relieved to see Rex. After the carnival, Michael phones Dr. Evans to tell her what he now knows about the crash.|$|E
500|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals the}} story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a simple Jat boy, from Delhi. He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the one thing is common among all artists, singers, painters, etc., is 'pain,' especially, via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't {{be able to reach}} his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. JJ accidentally sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called [...] "Shut Up & Dance" [...] when he and his friends go to venue, where the contest is about to start. He goes inside only to see this girl's performance, even though he initially refuses to go inside the auditorium. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a Kashmiri Pandit from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the [...] "perfect heartbreaking machine". Since JJ wanted to succeed, and <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> word of Khatana telling him that pain, especially from heartbreak, is the way to become an artist, he decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time, JJ and Heer will become good friends, often going on fun, nasty, naughty, and spicy adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

2500|$|After Torque defeats the creature, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> murders.

2500|$|Slightly– Slightly is {{the most}} {{conceited}} because he believes <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> days before he was [...] "lost". He is the only Lost Boy who [...] "knows" [...] his last name– he says his pinafore had the words [...] "Slightly Soiled" [...] written on the tag. He cuts whistles from the branches of trees, and dances to tunes he creates himself. Slightly is, apparently, a poor make-believer.

2500|$|At {{six years}} old, Piper was {{converted}} to faith in Christ at his mother's knee while {{on vacation in}} Florida. He remarks that it [...] "blows him away" [...] that he was saved at six years old, not because <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> event, but because the Bible tells him what happened to him. When he shared his testimony on his website, desiringgod.org, he said that it's very dangerous to rely on one's memory or experience when pondering when God saved them. He states this is the case, because both are fallible and can be misleading. Thus, he wants to encourage others like himself who can't remember the exact date of their conversion, by pointing them to what the Bible says.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle's De anima (On the Soul) {{divides the}} mind into three parts: sensation, {{imagination}} and intellection. When one perceives an object, his mind composites a sense-image. When <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> object he previously sensed, he is imagining its form (the {{image of the}} imagination is often translated as [...] "phantasm"). When he extracts information from this phantasm, he is using his intellect. Consequently, all human knowledge concerning universals (such as species and properties) are derived from the phantasm ("the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver"), which itself is a recollection of an experience. Concerning the question of [...] "Whether the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible species {{of which it is}} possessed, without turning to the phantasms?" [...] in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas quotes Aristotle in the sed contra: [...] "the soul understands nothing without a phantasm." [...] Hence the peripatetic axiom. (Another theorem to be drawn from this is that error is a result of drawing false conclusions based on our sensations.) ...|$|E
