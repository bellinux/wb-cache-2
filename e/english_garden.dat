5|$|Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia {{designed}} the <b>English</b> <b>Garden</b> in 1910. It was first {{known as the}} Wisteria Garden. In 1925, Ninah attended a lecture on azaleas given by H. Harold Hume, a horticulturist known for his work with azaleas, camellias, and citrus. This lecture sparked her interest in azaleas, so she visited azalea gardens in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration. Advised by Hume, she replanted much of her <b>English</b> <b>garden</b> with them, renaming it the Azalea Garden.|$|E
5|$|Later work, {{during the}} 1750s and 1760s, was {{undertaken}} by the landscape gardener Capability Brown. This included extending the gardens {{to the north and}} removing the central cascade making the combe into a single sweep. The garden, as it was originally laid out, influenced other designers and contributed to defining the style of garden thought of as the <b>English</b> <b>garden</b> in continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|The first rural {{cemetery}} in the United States—Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts—was {{developed in the}} 1830s.

The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the <b>English</b> <b>garden</b> movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Echoing {{the fate}} of the {{previous}} memorial, the new dog was moved into storage in 1992 by Battersea Park's owners, the Conservative Borough of Wandsworth, they said as part of a park renovation scheme. Anti-vivisectionists campaigned for its return, suspicious of the explanation. It was reinstated in the park's Woodland Walk in 1994, near the Old <b>English</b> <b>Garden,</b> a more secluded spot than before.|$|E
5|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Garden</b> is a {{rectangular}} garden featuring brick paths, a pergola that features cypress {{trees at the}} head of the garden, and a number of statues and garden ornaments. The garden has hundreds of native trees, shrubs, and perennials, most notably azaleas. It also features a wall garden, which was built in 1922. The centerpiece of the garden is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old <b>English</b> <b>Garden.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first gardens on the Cummer {{property}} {{were designed}} by Ossian Cole Simonds in 1903, just after the adjoining house was completed. Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia redesigned this garden and created what would {{become known as the}} <b>English</b> <b>Garden</b> in 1910. Ellen Biddle Shipman designed the Italian Garden in 1931. Sections of Clara and Waldo's garden {{were designed by}} William Lyman Phillips, a partner in the Olmstead Brothers firm. The Olmsted Brothers also advised Ninah on a design for a wall garden in 1922, but she chose to plant a garden designed by William Mercer of Philadelphia. The Cummer Gardens were selected for the National Register of Historic Places because they represent the history of American landscape design in the first four decades of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the <b>English</b> <b>Garden</b> in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's main {{new project}} at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century was the Park Güell (1900–1914), commissioned by Eusebi Güell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an <b>English</b> <b>garden</b> city. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaudí's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park Güell is situated in Barcelona's Càrmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaudí negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaudí at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid. After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaudí's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the Hypostyle Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large Doric columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics ("trencadís"), the work of Josep Maria Jujol. The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaudí's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the Casa-Museu Gaudí.|$|E

25|$|As Stowe {{evolved from}} an English baroque garden into a {{pioneering}} landscape park, the gardens became an attraction {{for many of}} the nobility, including political leaders. Indeed, Stowe {{is said to be the}} first <b>English</b> <b>garden</b> for which a guide book was produced. Wars and rebellions were reputedly discussed among the garden's many temples; the artwork of the time reflected this by portraying caricatures of the better-known politicians of history taking their ease in similar settings. Stowe began to evolve into a series of natural views to be appreciated from a perambulation rather than from a well-chosen central point. In their final form the Gardens were the largest and most elaborate example of what became known in Europe as the <b>English</b> <b>garden.</b> The main gardens, enclosed within the ha-has (sunken or trenched fences) over four miles (6km) in length, cover over , but the park also has many buildings, including gate lodges and other monuments.|$|E
