50|$|Danthonia decumbens (formerly Sieglingia decumbens) is {{a species}} of grass {{commonly}} known as the <b>heath</b> <b>grass,</b> heath-grass, or staggers grass It is a tussock grass native to Europe and adjacent parts of Asia and North Africa. It may also be native to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.|$|R
50|$|The {{steep hill}} is wooded with open {{grassland}} at the top. The site has many ancient trees, {{but the main}} ones are hybrid black-poplar and London plane, the result of former landscaping. There are also wild service trees and midland hawthorns. The ground flora includes bluebells, <b>heath</b> <b>grass</b> and compact rush.|$|R
25|$|This can be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} <b>heath</b> <b>grass</b> (Danthonia decumbens), pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), mat grass (Nardus stricta), fine-leaved sheep's-fescue (Festuca filiformis), mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella) and field wood-rush (Luzula campestris). Clay heaths have become very rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the Wilseder Berg and south of Niederhaverbeck.|$|R
50|$|Grassland {{surrounding}} drier {{areas is}} composed of red fescue (Festuca rubra), common bent (Agrostis capillaris), sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), crested dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and <b>heath</b> <b>grass</b> (Danthonia decumbens). Crags and north-facing scarp slopes support bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and heather (Calluna vulgaris), fir clubmoss (Lycopodium selago) and parsley fern (Cryptogramma crispa). Green spleenwort (Asplenium viride) is found on limestone outcrops.|$|R
50|$|Chalk heath in {{southern}} Britain includes calcicoles such as salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris) and common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), and calcifuges such as bell heather (Erica cinerea), ling heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>heath</b> <b>grass</b> (Danthonia decumbens), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and betony (Stachys officinalis). It also includes plants which can tolerate both acidic and basic conditions, such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) and sometimes juniper (Juniperus communis).|$|R
50|$|Molinia caerulea is an {{herbaceous}} perennial bunchgrass (tussock-forming), {{growing up}} to 90 cm tall (taller when sheltered by gorse and heather), with many closely packed stems. The leaves are coarse, green, taper to a point, long, flat and sometimes slightly hairy on top. Due to the dense tussock {{it is very}} resistant to heath fires. Its ligule is a ring of hairs, as in <b>heath</b> <b>grass</b> (Danthonia decumbens). The long narrow purple spikelets are a major identification feature - the panicle is 15 cm long.|$|R

50|$|Chalk heath occurs where a {{thin layer}} of acidic soil (often loess or sand) overlies a basic (alkaline) one, such as chalk. Shallow-rooted plants grow only in the acidic soil (typically a few {{centimetres}} thick), and so these are species characteristic of acidic habitats. Deeper-rooted plants can reach the underlying alkaline substrate, and so these include species characteristic of alkaline habitats. Plants also occur which are able to tolerate both acidic and basic conditions. There are no plants restricted entirely to chalk heath, and the animals are also those characteristic of chalk grassland and heathland. The vegetation structure of chalk <b>heath</b> resembles <b>grass</b> <b>heath,</b> being short grassy vegetation with heather growing up through it, with some scattered heather bushes.|$|R
50|$|Areas of banksia woodland, sheoak forest, open <b>heath</b> and <b>grassed</b> dunes can all {{be found}} within the park. Notable flora include Banksia coccinea, Hakea elliptica, Allocasuarina trichodon, Agonis marginata and Dryandra formosa. The area {{is home to the}} most {{significant}} remaining stands of scarlet banksia, Banksia coccinea, in the region, however this community is threatened by Phytophthora dieback.|$|R
40|$|Question: Are {{differences}} in landscape use of semi-domesticated reindeer {{reflected in the}} vegetation of summer grazing grounds? Location: Alpine heaths, central east Sweden. Methods: Dry <b>heath</b> and <b>grass</b> <b>heath</b> vegetation plots with inferred grazing intensities (high, intermediate and low) were selected a priori from an interpolated pellet count map compiled in 2002. In each plot, faecal pellets were counted, environmental variables measured and vegetation sampled by listing presence and absence. Species composition was compared with a detrended correspondence analysis, and a canonical correspondence {{analysis was used to}} infer relations between species composition and environmental variables. Plots were also clustered to provide groupings for an indicator species analysis. Results: Significant {{differences in}} faecal pellet count were present between the highest and lowest grazing intensities for both vegetation types, showing that the pattern in the interpolated pellet maps was robust. Differences in species composition between grazing intensities were found for the dry heath only. Here, there was an apparent grazing gradient, with lichens and mosses in the low-use plots and grasses and herbs in the high-use plots. No such gradient was found for the <b>grass</b> <b>heath.</b> Conclusions: Within the dry heath vegetation type, grazing levels had a subtle effect on the vegetation, while no effects were seen in the <b>grass</b> <b>heath,</b> probably {{as a result of the}} dominance of more grazing-tolerant graminoids. Even in the dry heath, species richness did not differ between grazing levels, but the relative abundances of species differed...|$|R
6000|$|Buzzby and {{his party}} were the first ready and off to cut moss. They drew a sledge after them towards the Red-snow Valley, which was not more than two miles distant from the ship. This [...] "mossing", as it was termed, {{was by no means}} a {{pleasant}} duty. Before the winter became severe the moss could be cut out from the beds of the snow streams with comparative ease, but now the mixed turf of willows, <b>heaths,</b> <b>grasses,</b> and moss was frozen solid, and had to be quarried with crowbars and carried to the ship like so much stone. However, it was prosecuted vigorously, and a sufficient quantity was soon procured to pack on the decks of the ship, and around its sides, so as to keep out the cold. At the same time the operation of discharging the stores was carried on briskly, and Fred, in company with Meetuck, O'Riley, and Joseph West, started with the dog-sledge on a hunting expedition.|$|R

50|$|Cenarrhenes nitida is {{endemic to}} {{southern}} and western Tasmania {{and some of}} its islands, growing to an altitude of 800 m, the margins of the alpine zone. It occurs most often as an understory tree to small shrub in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforest with poor soils and occasionally in <b>heath,</b> button <b>grass</b> sedgeland and scrub. Offshore populations occur inland on South Bruny Island and in forested areas of the De Witt Islands which closely resemble environments on mainland Tasmania.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} present in most of Europe, in the East Palearctic ecozone and in the Near East. [...] It prefers {{mountain}} and subalpine meadows with tall <b>grasses,</b> <b>heaths</b> with rough vegetation and woodland clearings. It is quite common in calcareous grasslands with Brachypodium pinnatum.|$|R
50|$|The sandhill rustyhood is {{only known}} from populations at Tailem Bend, Grange, Coorong National Park, Poltalloch and other {{locations}} on the Narrung Peninsula. It is locally common in sandy soil on coloured sand dunes in mallee and Callitris woodland with an understorey of shrub, <b>heath,</b> sedge and <b>grass.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mostly {{active at}} dusk or dawn (crepuscular), {{it can be}} nocturnal after high daytime temperatures. It lives in long <b>grasses,</b> <b>heaths,</b> and woodlands, and is most often seen on warm mornings, {{foraging}} for food. When threatened, the scaly-foot flashes its thick, fleshy tongue, in an apparent mimicry of snakes. Usually two eggs are laid per clutch.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{are rarely}} {{found in this}} zone, {{and when they do}} grow, they take the low, {{sprawling}} Krummholz form. Shrubs are common, especially dwarf evergreen species like partridgefoot, kinnikinnick, crowberry, lingonberry, and alpine-azalea. <b>Grasses,</b> <b>heath,</b> and sedges are also present. Wetter areas see a larger variety of plant species. Higher elevations are exclusively the realm of the lichens.|$|R
50|$|Old {{field is}} a term used in ecology to {{describe}} lands formerly cultivated or grazed but later abandoned. The dominant flora include perennial <b>grasses,</b> <b>heaths</b> and herbaceous plants. Old fields are canonically defined as an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community, a concept which has been debated by contemporary ecologists for some time.|$|R
25|$|The Fulufjället massif {{is a high}} plateau deeply gouged {{by several}} rivers that flow into the mighty river Dalälven, which, far downstream, creates the unique {{topography}} of Färnebofjärden National Park. The geography is dominated by lichen, bare mountains, and valleys with dense old-growth forest. The <b>heaths</b> of brush, <b>grass</b> and lichens are unique in the Scandinavian Mountains, {{a result of the}} absence of grazing reindeers.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{fertilize}} the fields, pieces of <b>heath</b> or <b>grass</b> including roots and humus ("plaggen") were cut {{and used as}} bedding for cattle. In springtime, this bedding, enriched with slurry was then spread over the fields near the village as manure. The long term practice of this form of agriculture created a rich agricultural soil {{to a depth of}} between 40 cm and over 1.50 m, unlike modern arable soils, which tend to be just 30 centimetres deep. The raised fields give rise to a typical landscape with sharp breaks in elevation and are called Plaggenesch in Germany or Es in Dutch. This form of agriculture stopped around 1900 with the introduction of fertilizers.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Muldoanich" [...] is {{probably}} the anglicised version of the Maol Dòmhnaich meaning [...] "Duncan's rounded hill". It is shown with that name on Ordnance Survey maps. Mul Domhnach, meaning [...] "Sunday island", is another possible derivation. Writing in the 16th century, Dean Munro referred to the island as [...] "Scarp" [...] and it appears as [...] "Scarpa" [...] on Blaeu's atlas of 1654. Martin Martin refers to [...] "Muldonish" [...] in his 1695 voyage around the Western Isles, stating [...] "about a mile in circumference; it is high in the middle, covered over with <b>heath</b> and <b>grass,</b> {{and is the only}} forest here for maintaining the deer, being commonly about seventy or eighty in number." ...|$|R
50|$|Seral {{communities}} in secondary succession {{can be seen}} in a recently logged coniferous forest. During the first two years, <b>grasses,</b> <b>heaths</b> and herbaceous plants such as fireweed will be abundant. After a few more years shrubs will start to appear; and about six to eight years after clearing, the area is likely to be crowded with young birches. Each of these stages can be referred to as a seral community.|$|R
5000|$|Visitors {{are free}} to wander the grounds and enjoy many trails found on the island. Starting at the light station, they include a short trails to the east [...] "landing", a loop trail to the west [...] "landing" [...] {{as well as a}} longer trail {{down the center of the}} island to the {{boathouse}} and dock at the south end. [...] To the east is an old engine house that was used to haul supplies up from the landing. The building, thought to have been finished in 1901, is the only one built of sandstone quarried from the island. The bulldozer that was used to make these trails can be found along the trail to the west landing. A rare <b>heath</b> rush (<b>grass)</b> found on Devil's Island is thought to have been carried to the island on the tracks of the army surplus bulldozer which was once used in Greenland.|$|R
5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open <b>grass</b> <b>heath</b> land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|R
50|$|Two key environments meet in Besthorpe. To {{the north}} and east the East Nottinghamshire Sandlands are an {{increasingly}} rare habitat supporting <b>grass</b> <b>heaths,</b> bracken, gorse and broom with mixed small-scale plantations of birch, oak and Scots pine. The River Fleet and the fields to the west are part of the Trent Washlands which provide the village with its River Meadowlands landscape of meadow and river pastures, extensive grasslands and meandering river channels. More detailed commentary {{can be found on the}} website of our local Newark and Sherwood District Council.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} islands in the archipelago, East Falkland and West Falkland, along with over 700 smaller ones. 19 land {{habitats}} are recognised. The soil types in the island vary, due to the relative dryness of the west compared {{to the east and}} differences in altitude. Many coastal areas have tussac grass, which needs high humidity and salty air to flourish. Inland habitats are often <b>heath,</b> either <b>grass</b> or shrubs, or feldmark made of cushion plants. Lowlands have acidic peaty soil with a low fertility. These lowlands support grass in wetter areas, but only shrubs in the drier areas. In the areas with high nutrient levels, the lowlands can support turf, however most peat is very shallow and lies on top of clay. The mountains usually have clay or stony soils, on which only feldmark plants such as cushion plants can grow and which support a very small diversity of species.|$|R
50|$|In 1106, five Dutchmen journeyed {{from the}} mouth of the Rhine to Bremen to {{negotiate}} an arrangement with Archbishop Frederick I of Bremen to settle the swampy regions south of the Hunte on both sides of the Weser River, an area which came to be called Stedingen. The peasants were to cultivate the land, which would pass from father to son in free hereditary possession, while every settler would pay a yearly tax of one pfennig, the eleventh sheaf of all harvests, and a tenth of all livestock as acknowledgement of the archbishop's overlordship; otherwise, they would be free to administer their own affairs without interference by any secular lord. The arrangement found great favor among the younger Dutch peasants, who went to settle the area in large numbers, despite the difficulty of cultivating the marshy moorland, where the soil was poor and <b>Heath,</b> cotton <b>grass</b> and reeds covered the land and the riverbank. The settlers dug ditches to drain much of the water and built dikes to provide dry land and to prevent flooding.|$|R
5000|$|Stingray Swamp is {{composed}} of a rich array of flora and fauna, which is influenced {{to a large extent}} by the underlying biophysical and geomorphic character. The flora of the immediate region consists of dry sclerophyll forest, montane peat shrubs and Cumberland plain woodland species. Stingray swamp exhibits a distinctive and rich mixture of <b>heath,</b> shrub, <b>grasses</b> and fern species. The central areas within the swamp are dense with low canopies of around 1.5-2 meters in height. Leptospermum and coral fern species are dominant features within the floral makeup of the ecosystem. Vegetation grades to open woodland on the outer edges and away from swamp areas. These areas are dominated by eucalyptus species in the range of 5-15 meters tall. Animal species range from birds, reptiles, insects and mammals with current records indicating 15 species. Most notable is the variety of birdlife due to dense vegetation, which has drawn bird watching groups. SWFR is also host to several state and nationally protected and endangered species. Of note are the following species that area listed at State and National levels: ...|$|R
50|$|Heath {{is found}} {{commonly}} inland, {{made up of}} either grass or shrubs. The most common grass species is whitegrass (Cortaderia pilosa), and this <b>grass</b> <b>heath</b> covers {{the majority of the}} main islands. These grasses support other flowering plants, along with insects and birds. The shrub heath is composed mostly of low-growing shrubs such as diddle-dee, and also hosts many other plant species along with invertebrates and small birds. In the feldmark environments formed on exposed ridges and higher areas, cushion plants such as balsam bog (Bolax gummifera). Species of fern can also grow in such areas. In the most extreme areas, only lichen and specialised plants such as snakeplants can grow.|$|R
