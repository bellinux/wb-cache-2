50|$|Among the {{significant}} frequency pulling mechanisms inherent {{to the gas}} cell are wall-shift, buffer-gas shift, cavity-shift and light-shift. The wall-shift occurs as the gas bumps into {{the wall of the}} glass container. Wall-shift can be reduced by wall coating and compensation by buffer gas. The buffer gas shift comes from the reference atoms which bounce into buffer gas atoms such as neon and argon; these shifts can be both positive and negative. The cavity shift comes from the RF cavity, which can deform the resonance amplitude response; this depends upon cavity centre frequency and resonator Q-value. Light-shift is an effect where frequency is pulled differently depending on the light intensity, which often is modulated by the temperature shift of the rubidium lamp and <b>filter</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

To achieve high performance in different grid conditions, cascaded filters are developed for distorted and unbalanced grids. This paper also analyzes the robustness of the filter for small frequency variations, and improves its frequency-adaptive ability for large frequency changes. Furthermore, it is proved that this filter can also be applied for the synchronization in a single-phase system. Considering the digital implementation of the filter, four discretization methods and the resulting limitations are investigated.

Antibodies directed against neuronal and inducible NOS (n and iNOS respectively) and NADPH-diaphorase activity were used to reveal the locations of NOS, while antibodies directed against acetylated tubulin were used to visualize nerve fibres. The nNOS antibody labelled structures in all investigated photophores except in the organs from P. notatus. The photocytes of P. notatus showed NADPH-diaph- orase activity.

40|$|The reflectionless <b>filter</b> <b>cell</b> {{described}} in this article alleviates many system problems associated with excess out-of-band gain, impedance mismatches, and component interactions. The simplest <b>filter</b> <b>cell</b> exhibits a third-order Inverse Chebyshev response with 14. 47 dB peak stopband attenuation, and several can be cascaded for additional attenuation as needed. They are simple to design and easy to use - for much like small fixed attenuators ("pads"), they can be placed anywhere in the signal path desired without fear of causing unwanted standing waves, and instead reducing them where they already exist beyond the intended frequency range. Compared to conventional filter topologies with similar cutoff frequencies, they exhibit an order of magnitude greater amplitude and phase stability, ensuring accurate and repeatable complex gain in calibrated systems. Finally, the component requirements are moderate in value and minimal in number, easing their implementation while improving design yield, and extending the applicability of a given component technology beyond the normal range, both above and below.

40|$|A micro-arrayed {{multichannel}} {{optical filter}} is proposed {{to allow the}} colposcopy to have an ability of multispectral imaging. The micro-arrayed filter is fabricated by micro-lithographic procedures and vacuum multilayer thin film coatings, and the wavelengths of light passing through the filter correspond to the characteristic peaks of the biomarkers in the reflectance or fluorescence spectra. After integrating the filter with an image sensor on colposcopy, multiple spectral images centered at different wavelengths can be obtained to provide the information about morphological changes on cervical surface and the quantitative variation of the biomarkers in cervical tissues. The micro-arrayed filter with four kinds of filter cells (位 1 = 630 nm, 位 2 = 460 nm, 位 3 = 515 nm, 位 4 = 577 nm) has been fabricated successfully with an area of 10 渭m脳 10 渭m for each <b>filter</b> <b>cell.</b> The bandwidth of each <b>filter</b> <b>cell</b> is about 40 nm, and the transmittance is between 30 % and 40 %.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{progresses}} on {{the various}} fields related to the project will be described. On the one hand, the development of suitable and reliable <b>filter</b> <b>cells</b> is a crucial task. Especially further decrease of the wall relaxation rate remains to be important. Therefore, we embarked on coatings made out of Cs suboxides, in particular Cs 7 O, and compared such cells in an elementary neutron experiment with those simply coated with Cs. To enable wide angle applications of the 3 He neutron spin filter technique, like reflectometry or small angle scattering, the cell design has been modified {{in order to get}} access to scattering angles up to 18 o. A new type of transportation unit, well adapted to the requirements of those cells, has been constructed and tested. On the other hand, the construction of a filling station to supply <b>filter</b> <b>cells</b> is indispensable. Although a 3 He polarisation degree of 80 during optical pumping had been achieved reliably, further improvements for a novel optical pumping cell has been evaluated prepared and tested. Moreover progresses in the compressor completion are discussed. To integrate it, the rebuilding of the filling station for a flow through type of operation has been evaluated and afterwards the construction of certain parts upgraded, allowing determination of the polarisation in each of the 4 optical pumping cells which {{will be part of the}} filling station in the future...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{and plastic}} bead columns coated with {{antigenic}} protein molecules {{were used as}} an immunological <b>filter</b> for <b>cell</b> populations containing immune cells of relevant specificity. A selective elimination of these immune cells from the passing cell suspension was regularly noted and it approached, in some experiments, complete abolition of the specific immune reactivity of the <b>filtered</b> <b>cell</b> population. This specific retention of immune cells by antigenic columns could be selectively blocked {{by the presence of}} free antigen molecules in the medium during filtration. The results obtained support the concept of a cell-associated antigen-specific receptor being present on the outer surface of immune cells, displaying the same antigen-binding specificity as the potential product of the cell, the humoral antibody. Using the present bead column system, results were obtained indicating that this receptor was an active product of the immune cells and not any passively adsorbed, cytophilic antibody. Antigenic bead columns may very well constitute a tool for the production in vitro of cell populations being specifically deprived of immune reactivity and allow detailed analysis of the characteristics of the cell-associated antibody of immune cells...|$|R

The apparatus and particulate/suspension properties are briefly described and filtration data typical of that acquired during the investigation are presented. The conditions under which unexpected changes in cake structure occur are identified. It is shown how filtration parameters such as pressure, <b>filter</b> <b>cell</b> diameter and particle dispersion all influence the onset of both irreversible and reversible changes in cake structure and how these changes induce disturbances in the expected filtrate flow. Analyses of the experimental data and their relation to previous studies suggest that more localised changes in cake structure are responsible for the effects observed. The most probable mechanism is the migration of particle fines within a forming cake leading to the establishment of preferential flow channels; alternative mechanisms are also presented and discussed.
