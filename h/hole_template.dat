Such process allows a better {{control of the}} gold nanoparticle size distribution which provides a sharper localized surface plasmon resonance. This makes such route appealing for sensing applications since the figure of merit of the Au nanoparticles obtained after thermal evaporation is more than doubled. Such process could besides allow tuning the localized surface plasmon resonance by using copolymer with various molecular weights and thus be attractive for surface enhanced raman spectroscopy...|$|E
30|$|Common current {{approaches}} {{share that}} the produced GaAs dots are rather shallow {{and it is}} hard to realize a good confinement. For dots defined by thickness fluctuations, this problem is intrinsic to the fabrication and the use of two-dimensional islands of the epitaxial growth [13]. When defining the <b>hole</b> <b>template</b> by etching, these holes tend to be shallow preventing the growth of thick lower AlGaAs barriers [7]. Alternatively, the bottom barrier is grown first and then structured by in situ etching, introducing a growth interruption exposing an AlGaAs surface [9, 12, 23]. Extended thick GaAs structures are commonly not found, even though they would offer an additional tuning parameter, broadening the optical and physical properties.|$|E

In the image, the hole-mound structure surrounded by a flat layer can be identified exhibiting only monolayer high steps. Comparing the hole-mound structures to the initial one in Fig.  1 a, no significant changes are visible. The holes roughly keep their shape and the average hole depth stays unchanged. Furthermore, no changes of the mound structure are observed. This indicates that the initial 5 -nm Al 0.33 Ga 0.67 As layer covers the surface and copies the underlying morphology.|$|E

In the absence of an As counter pressure, the sample was exposed repeatedly 20 times to a Ga flux of one monolayer (ML) per minute for 30  s followed by a 30 -s growth interruption at a substrate temperature of 450  °C. A streaky RHEED showed up after six to seven ML indicating a complete removal of the native oxide layer. During the Ga-assisted deoxidation process, we ramped the As cell to 290  °C corresponding to an increase of the low background pressure from 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 9 mbar to 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 8  mbar. After finishing the initial Ga deposition, the As cell temperature is raised to 314  °C and the gallium rate is increased to ~ 0.3  μm/h. The sample is annealed for 5  min during the time that the As cell needs to reach 314  °C with the shutter closed.|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermally {{synthesized}} {{zinc oxide}} nanowire arrays {{have been used}} as nanostructured acceptors in emerging photovoltaic (PV) devices. The nanoscale dimensions of such arrays allow for enhanced charge extraction from PV active layers, but the device performance critically depends on the nanowire array pitch and alignment. In this study, we templated hydrothermally-grown ZnO nanowire arrays via high-resolution electron-beam-lithography defined masks, achieving the dual requirements of high-resolution patterning at a pitch of several hundred nanometers, while maintaining hole sizes small enough to control nanowire array morphology. We investigated several process conditions, including the effect of annealing sputtered and spincoated ZnO seed layers on nanowire growth, to optimize array property metrics—branching from individual <b>template</b> <b>holes</b> and off-normal alignment. We found that decreasing <b>template</b> <b>hole</b> size decreased branching prevalence but also reduced alignment. Annealing seed layers typically improved alignment, and sputtered seed layers yielded nanowire arrays superior to spincoated seed layers. We show that these effects arose from variation {{in the size of the}} <b>template</b> <b>holes</b> relative to the ZnO grain size in the seed layer. The quantitative control of branching and alignment of the nanowire array that is achieved in this study will open new paths toward engineering more efficient electrodes to increase photocurrent in nanostructured PVs. This control is also applicable to inorganic nanowire growth in general, nanomechanical generators, nanowire transistors, and surface-energy engineering.

30|$|A mold with {{periodically}} aligned vertical ZnO NRs on a GaN substrate {{was achieved}} by polymer-templated hydrothermal growth [24, 25]. The GaN substrate is appropriate for vertical ZnO NR growth because of the well-matched epitaxial growth between GaN and ZnO [24]. A 10 -nm-thick ZnO film was deposited by sputtering onto the GaN substrate as a seed layer, and the polymer <b>hole</b> <b>template</b> was obtained by nanoimprint lithography. An UV-curable imprint resin composed of polydimethylsiloxane material (Gelest), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (Aldrich), and Irgacure 184 (Ciba) was prepared with a weight ratio of 87 : 10 : 3, respectively. This nanoimprint resin was spin-coated at 6000  rpm for 200  s on the ZnO seed/GaN substrate and subsequently UV-imprinted using a transparent stamp with periodic nanopillars at 7  bar for 8  min. After detaching the stamp from the UV-cured polymer resin, a dry etching process was performed using a CF 4 gas plasma (50 sccm, 20 mTorr, 20  W, 30  s) to remove any residual layer under the hole trenches until the underlying ZnO seed layer was exposed.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{demonstrated}} {{that by the}} combination of Ga-assisted deoxidation and local hole etching at room temperature optical active mesoscopic GaAs structures (MGS) with a maximal length up to 1.2  μm[*]×[*] 0.2  μm can be fabricated. We investigated the overgrowth behavior of a facetted, initial <b>hole</b> <b>template</b> with AlGaAs. We engineered a hole-mound-like structure with an aspect ratio of the middle hole of 0.8 in [1 – 10] to [110] direction, a hole depth between 15 and 19  nm and a mound elongation of 800  nm × 200  nm in the [1 – 10] to [110] surface direction. In a systematic study, the hole-mounds were filled with GaAs and MGS were formed with an aspect ratio of up to 9 for a sample with 10 -nm GaAs filling. These detailed morphological studies by AFM in conjunction with HAADF-STEM results allowed us to develop a detailed cross-sectional image of the MGS. The MGS were finally capped with AlGaAs/GaAs to investigate their optical emission. We found room temperature luminescence for our entire sample set. Low temperature μ-PL investigations allowed the identification of three main contributors: the QW formed by the flat area around the MGS, the elongated mounds of the MGS, and the deep hole inside the MGS. μ- PL of a single MGS revealed that the signal is composed of sharp features, which were identified as energetically closely spaced excitonic lines with the single line exhibiting a linewidth down to 180  μeV. The temperature development of the MGS spectra indicated a charge transfer from the QW regions to the elongated MGS.|$|E

The efficiency of GaNxP 1 -x/GaNyP 1 -y core-shell nanowire solar cell (NWSC) {{is expected to reach}} as high as 44 % by 1 % N and 9 % N in the core and shell, respectively. By developing such high efficiency NWSCs on silicon substrate, a further reduction of the cost of solar photovoltaic can be further reduced to 61 $/MWh, which is competitive to levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of fossil fuels. Therefore, a suitable NWSC structure and fabrication process need to be developed to achieve this promising NWSC. This thesis is devoted to the study on the development of fabrication process of GaNxP 1 -x/GaNyP 1 -y core-shell Nanowire solar cell. The thesis is divided into two major parts. In the first parts, previously grown GaP/ GaNyP 1 -y core-shell nanowire samples are used to develop the fabrication process of Gallium Nitride Phosphide nanowire solar cell. The design for nanowire arrays, passivation layer, polymeric filler spacer, transparent col- lecting layer and metal contact are discussed and fabricated. The property of these NWSCs are also characterized to point out the future development of Gal- lium Nitride Phosphide NWSC.

This paper introduces a robust algorithm for completion of such meshes using a mapping between the incomplete mesh and a template model.

We employ this mapping to correctly glue together {{the components of}} the input mesh and to close the <b>holes.</b> The <b>template</b> is used to fill in the topological and geometric information missing in the input. The completed models are guaranteed to have the same topology as the template. Furthermore, if no appropriate template exists or if only topologically correct completion is required a standard canonical shape {{can be used as a}} template. As part of our completion method we propose a boundary-mapping technique useful for mesh editing operations such as merging, blending, and detail transfer. We demonstrate that by using this technique we can automatically perform complex editing operations that previously required a large amount of user interaction...|$|R

By using a very small <b>hole</b> in the <b>template</b> one could sometimes view an empty region of the diagram and other times not, so that even in these cases, one could say that traffic was not stationary. Clearly, for such fine level of observation, stationary traffic does not exist.

40|$|The {{standard}} post-Newtonian approximation to gravitational waveforms, called T-approximants, from non-spinning {{black hole}} binaries are known {{not to be}} sufficiently accurate close to the last stable orbit of the system. A new approximation, called P-approximants, is believed to improve {{the accuracy of the}} waveforms rendering them applicable up to the last stable orbit. In this study we apply P-approximants to the case of a test-particle in equatorial orbit around a Kerr black hole parameterized by a spin parameter q that takes values between - 1 and 1. In order to assess the performance of the two approximants we measure their effectualness (i. e. larger overlaps with the exact signal), and faithfulness (i. e. smaller biases while measuring the parameters of the signal) with the exact (numerical) waveforms. We find {{that in the case of}} prograde orbits, that is orbits whose angular momentum is in the same sense as the spin angular momentum of the black <b>hole,</b> T-approximant <b>templates</b> obtain an effectualness of ~ 0. 99 for spins q 0. 99 for all spins up to q = 0. 95. The bias in the estimation of parameters is much lower in the case of P-approximants than T-approximants. We find that P-approximants are both effectual and faithful and should be more effective than T-approximants as a detection template family when q> 0. For q< 0 both T- and P-approximants perform equally well so that either of them could be used as a detection template family. Comment: 23 pages, 2 Tables and 18 Figure...|$|R

Whereas the previous investigations employed post-Newtonian (PN) templates describing only the inspiral part of the signal, the recent progress in analytical and numerical relativity has provided analytical waveform templates coherently describing the inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) signals. We show that a search for binary black <b>holes</b> employing IMR <b>templates</b> will be able to constrain the mass of the graviton much more accurately (about an order of magnitude) than a search employing PN templates. The best expected bound from GW observatories (lambda_g > 7. 8 x 10 ^ 13 km from Adv.

40|$|Invited paperIn {{recent years}} major advancements {{have been made}} in the {{directed}} self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP). Insertion of DSA for IC fabrication is seriously considered for the 7 nm node. At this node the DSA technology could alleviate costs for double patterning and limit the number of masks that would be required per layer. At imec multiple approaches for inserting DSA into the 7 nm node are considered. One of the most straightforward approaches for implementation would be for via patterning through templated DSA (grapho-epitaxy), since hole patterns are readily accessible through <b>templated</b> <b>hole</b> patterning of cylindrical phase BCP materials. Here, the pre-pattern template is first patterned into a spin-on hardmask stack. After optimizing the surface properties of the <b>template</b> the desired <b>hole</b> patterns can be obtained by the BCP DSA process.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of anode/organic interfacial contact {{is shown to}} be {{crucial to the performance}} and stability of archetypical small molecule organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this contribution, vapor-deposited lipophilic, hole-transporting 1, 4 -bis(phenyl-m-tolylamino) biphenyl (TPD) and 1, 4 -bis(1 -naphthylphenylamino) biphenyl (NPB) thin films are shown to undergo decohesion on ITO anode surfaces under mild heating. An effective approach to ameliorate such interfacial decohesion is introduction, via self-assembly or spin-coating, of covalently bound N(p-C 6 H 4 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3) 3 (TAA) - and 4, 4 ′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl) phenylamino]biphenyl (TPD-Si 2) -derived adhesion/injection layers at the anode/hole transport layer interface. The resulting angstrom-scale hole transport layers prevent decohesion of vapor-deposited hole transport layers and significantly enhance OLED hole injection fluence. OLEDs fabricated with these modified interfaces exhibit appreciably reduced turn-on voltages, considerably higher luminous intensities, and enhanced thermal robustness versus bare ITO-based control devices. Spin-coated, cross-linked TPD-Si 2 films, in particular, prove to be superior to conventional ITO functionalization interlayers, including copper phthalocyanine, in this regard. The present ITO-functionalized devices achieve maximum external forward quantum efficiencies as high as 1. 2 % and a luminous level of 15 000 cd/m 2 in simple ITO/interlayer/HTL/Alq/Al heterostructures. We also show that Cu(Pc) interlayers actually suppress, rather than enhance, <b>hole</b> injection and <b>template</b> crystallization of vapor-deposited TPD and NPB at modest temperatures, resulting in poor OLED thermal stability...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} an experimental approach that enables molecule visualizations of macromolecular diffusion and partitioning within well-defined pores. By colloidal templating, two-dimensional arrays of open, submicron cavities interconnected by small holes {{were created in}} dense polyacrylamide gels. Cavity size of the arrays varied from 600 to 1400 nm, with the corresponding holes about 4 – 5 times smaller. DNA molecules of sizes from 2. 69 to 48. 5 kbp were inserted into the cavity arrays and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. In video sequences, individual chain positions identified as the chains diffused under Brownian motion {{over a period of}} seconds to tens of minutes. For larger chains, dynamic configurations were resolved during the motion. ^ Over full range of molecular and pore sizes, we found that chain dynamics could be understood through the entropic barriers transport mechanism. At high confinement (large molecules in small cavities), this mechanism produces unexpected trends, for example, independence of diffusion coefficient on molecular size or faster diffusion of molecules in smaller pores. These trends reflect segmental excluded volume. Complicated dynamics akin to motion of an inchworm characterized the largest DNA chains, those with radius of gyration larger than the cavity radius. ^ Diffusion of linear and circular DNA molecules was compared for different molecular sizes, and the resulting differences in diffusion coefficient explained by differences in diffusion mechanism; linear molecules translocate through holes by forming loops, while linear chains predominantly translocate by threading one chain end. ^ A similar colloidal templating approach was also employed to create isolated cavity pair interconnected by a small <b>hole.</b> When <b>templated</b> by bidisperse colloid, the two cavities have unequal diameters. A DNA chain trapped inside such pair partitions unevenly, preferring the larger cavity, which afford greater configurational freedom. This sort of partitioning underlies many separation technologies but had not been visualized previously. The partition coefficient between cavities was measured visually for many combinations of cavity and molecular sizes, trends in this coefficient were then compared to existing theories for polymer partitioning. Good agreement over a two orders-of-magnitude variation of partition coefficient was obtained when effect of excluded volume on confinement free energy was introduced in a mean-field manner. ...|$|R
40|$|Mats of {{free-standing}} {{manganese oxide}} (MnxOy) nanowires have been fabricated as experimental electrode materials for rechargeable electrochemical power cells and capacitors. Because they are free-standing, the wires in these mats are electrochemically accessible. The {{advantage of the}} mat-of-nanowires configuration, relative to other configurations of electrode materials, arises from the combination of narrowness and high areal number density of the wires. This combination offers both high surface areas for contact with electrolytes and short paths for diffusion of ions {{into and out of}} the electrodes, thereby making it possible to charge and discharge at rates higher than would otherwise be possible and, consequently, to achieve greater power densities. The nanowires are fabricated in an electrolytic process in which there is no need for an electrode binder material. Moreover, there is no need to incorporate an electrically conductive additive into the electrode material; the only electrically conductive material that must be added is a thin substrate contact film at the anchored ends of the nanowires. Hence, the mass fraction of active electrode material is close to 100 percent, as compared with about 85 percent in conventional electrodes made from a slurry of active electrode material, binder, and conductive additive pressed onto a metal foil. The locations and sizes of the nanowires are defined by <b>holes</b> in <b>templates</b> in the form of commercially available porous alumina membranes. In experiments to demonstrate the present process, alumina membranes of various pore sizes and degrees of porosity were used. First, a film of Au was sputtered onto one side of each membrane. The membranes were then attached, variously, to carbon tape or a gold substrate by use of silver or carbon paste. Once thus attached, the membranes were immersed in a plating solution comprising 0. 01 M MnSO 4 + 0. 03 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The pH of the solution was kept constant at 8 by addition of H 2 SO 4 or NH 4 OH as needed. Mn(x) O(y) nanowires were potentiostatically electrodeposited in the pores in the alumina templates. Depending on the anodic deposition potentials, Mn(x) O(y) was deposited in various oxidation states [divalent (Mn 3 O 4), trivalent (Mn 2 O 3), or tetravalent (MnO 2) ]. The Mn(x) O(y) wires were made free-standing (see figure) by dissolving the alumina templates, variously, in KOH or NaOH at a concentration of 20 volume percent...|$|R

This expression is given {{as a function of}} the component masses and dimensionless spins (m_ 1, 2,χ_ 1, 2) of the two inspiralling objects, as well as of the mass M_ BH and (complex) frequency σ_ 1 of the fundamental quasi-normal mode of the remnant black <b>hole.</b> Our proposed <b>template</b> is obtained by fitting the post-merger waveform part of several publicly available numerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) catalog and then suitably interpolating over (symmetric) mass ratio and spins. We show that this analytic expression accurately reproduces (∼ 0. 01 rad) the phasing of the post-merger data of other datasets not used in its construction. This is notably the case of the spin-aligned run SXS:BBH: 0305, whose intrinsic parameters are consistent with the 90 % credible intervals reported by the parameter-estimation followup of GW 150914 in Phys.

This paper introduces a new method that uses computer-assisted technology and rapid prototyping to enhance drilling accuracy during core decompression surgeries and presents a validation study of cadaveric tests. Twelve cadaveric human femurs were used to simulate early-stage ischemic necrosis. The core decompression target at the anterolateral femoral head was simulated using an embedded glass ball (target). Three positioning Kirschner wires were drilled into {{the top and bottom}} of the large rotor. The specimen was then subjected to computed tomography (CT). A CT image of the specimen was imported into the Mimics software to construct a three-dimensional model including the target. The best core decompression channel was then designed using the 3 D model. A navigational template for the specimen was designed using the Pro/E software and manufactured by rapid prototyping technology to guide the drilling channel. The specimen-specific navigation template was installed on the specimen using positioning Kirschner wires. Drilling was performed using a guide needle through the guiding <b>hole</b> on the <b>templates.</b> The distance between the end point of the guide needle and the target was measured to validate the patient-specific surgical accuracy. The average distance between the tip of the guide needle drilled through the guiding template and the target was 1. 92 ± 0. 071 mm.

40|$|Current {{searches}} for gravitational waves from coalescing binary black <b>holes</b> (BBH) use <b>templates</b> that only include the dominant harmonic. In {{this study we}} use effective-one-body multipolar waveforms calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations to quantify the effect of neglecting sub-dominant harmonics on the sensitivity of searches. We consider both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the signal-based vetoes {{that are used to}} re-weight SNR. We find that neglecting sub-dominant modes when searching for non-spinning BBHs with component masses 3 M_≤ m_ 1, m_ 2 ≤ 200 M_ and total mass M < 360 M_ in advanced LIGO results in a negligible reduction of the re-weighted SNR at detection thresholds. Sub-dominant modes therefore have no effect on the detection rates predicted for advanced LIGO. Furthermore, we find that if sub-dominant modes are included in templates the sensitivity of the search becomes worse if we use current search priors, due to an increase in false alarm probability. Templates would need to be weighted differently than what is currently done to compensate for the increase in false alarms. If we split the template bank such that sub-dominant modes are only used when M ≳ 100 M_ and mass ratio q ≳ 4, we find that the sensitivity does improve for these intermediate mass-ratio BBHs, but the sensitive volume associated with these systems is still small compared to equal-mass systems. Using sub-dominant modes is therefore unlikely to substantially increase the probability of detecting gravitational waves from non-spinning BBH signals unless there is a relatively large population of intermediate mass-ratio BBHs in the universe.

The joint surface of the printed template had a roughness of Ra = 13 ± 2 μm. After abrasive blasting, the surface roughness was Ra = 7 ± 0. 5 μm. The surgical metal template was bound with the 3 D-printed Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic model. The micro-hardness values determined at the cross-sections of SLM-processed samples varied from HV 0. 3 250 to HV 0. 3 280, and the measured tensile strength was in the range of 450 MPa to 560 MPa, which showed that the template had requisite strength. Finally, the metal template was clinically used in the patient’s surgical operation, and the screws were inserted precisely as the result of using the auxiliary template. The geometrical parameters of the <b>template</b> <b>hole</b> (e. g., diameter and wall thickness) were optimized, and measures were taken to optimize the key geometrical units (e. g., hole units) in metal 3 D printing. Compared to the traditional technology of screw insertion, the use of the surgical metal template enabled the screws to be inserted more easily and accurately during spinal surgery. However, the design of the high-quality template should fully take into account the clinical demands of surgeons, as well as the advice of the designing engineers and operating technicians...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBuilding on the {{analytical}} {{description of the}} post-merger (ringdown) waveform of coalescing, nonprecessing, spinning binary black holes introduced by Damour and Nagar [Phys. Rev. D 90, 024054 (2014) PRVDAQ 1550 - 799810. 1103 /PhysRevD. 90. 024054], we propose an analytic, closed form, time-domain, representation of the ℓ=m= 2 gravitational radiation mode emitted after merger. This expression is given {{as a function of}} the component masses and dimensionless spins (m 1, 2,χ 1, 2) of the two inspiraling objects, as well as of the mass MBH and (complex) frequency σ 1 of the fundamental quasinormal mode of the remnant black <b>hole.</b> Our proposed <b>template</b> is obtained by fitting the post-merger waveform part of several publicly available numerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) catalog and then suitably interpolating over (symmetric) mass ratio and spins. We show that this analytic expression accurately reproduces (∼ 0. 01 [*][*]rad) the phasing of the post-merger data of other data sets not used in its construction. This is notably the case of the spin-aligned run SXS:BBH: 0305, whose intrinsic parameters are consistent with the 90 % credible intervals reported in the parameter-estimation followup of GW 150914 by B. P. Abbott et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241102 (2016) PRLTAO 0031 - 900710. 1103 /PhysRevLett. 116. 241102]. Using SXS waveforms as “experimental” data, we further show that our template could be used on the actual GW 150914 data to perform a new measure of the complex frequency of the fundamental quasinormal mode so as to exploit the complete (high signal-to-noise-ratio) post-merger waveform. We assess the usefulness of our proposed template by analyzing, in a realistic setting, SXS full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms and constructing posterior probability distribution functions for the central frequency damping time of the first overtone of the fundamental quasinormal mode as well as for the physical parameters of the systems. We also briefly explore the possibility opened by our waveform model to test the second law of black hole dynamics. Our model will help improve current tests of general relativity, in particular the general-relativistic no-hair theorem, and allow for novel tests, such as that of the area theorem...|$|R
40|$|Directed {{self-assembly}} (DSA) mutually benefits both bottom-up {{growth and}} top-down nanofabrication. This thesis investigates templated {{control over the}} alignment and morphology of two bottom-up nanostructures, ZnO nanowires (NWs) and cylinder-forming block copolymers (BCPs). Despite material differences, we highlight their analogous nature by applying similar engineering principles to both - structure and spatial design, systematic energy manipulation, and process-specific functionality. These engineering principles were fundamental to the thesis research, and could be applicable other directed self-assembly systems. Also, bottom-up growth provides a parallel process for fabricating high-resolution, functional nanostructures which are otherwise difficult or too time-consuming to produce with top-down fabrication. The DSA of BCPs in this thesis used cylinder-forming poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS), which forms in-plane cylinders of an PDMS after annealing and etching. The final line arrays can be high-resolution and well-defined, though they may suffer from poor long-range order. Many previous topographical templating methods have left behind unwanted patterning features and only oriented BCPs {{in the same direction}} as the template. This thesis aimed to overcome those limitation. The orthogonal self-assembly method used a bottom layer line array template to direct the orthogonal alignment of top-layer BCP cylinders, providing sub- 10 -nm nanomeshes with local control and over large areas. The other method, shear alignment by mismatch in the thermal coefficient of expansion, oriented BCP cylinders based on cracks in a top layer of silicon dioxide due to shear stress in the BCP film. The templated growth of ZnO nanowires in this thesis emphasized controlling the placement, morphology, and alignment of the NWs for solar cell applications. Single crystal, semiconducting ZnO NWs can be grown in a parallel, hydrothermal process, though the placement, density, morphology, and alignment can be difficult to control without templating. Electron-beam lithography-fabricated masks of holes and gratings, on different substrates, were investigated by varying <b>templating</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and other experimental parameters. We engineered the placement, alignment, branching, and length of the NWs with this DSA approach. The lithographic fabrication was expanded to square-mm-areas to investigate local charge collection and internal quantum efficiency for NW pitches of 100 - 1000 nm in research-scale solar cell devices. by Samuel M.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the size-selective sorting of biological cells using the assembly {{process known as}} Templated Assembly by Selective Removal (TASR). This research has demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, the selective self-assembly of mammalian as well as non-mammalian single cells into patterned hemispherical sites on rigid assembly templates using TASR. TASR-based size-selective assembly of biological systems represents a potentially valuable tool for biological applications from cell sorting and isolation of single cells to templating for artificial tissue generation. Not only is the assembly itself demonstrated to work effectively, {{but it is also}} demonstrated that this assembly technique can be made low cost and manufacturable by the use of polymer templates replicated from rigid master templates. Furthermore, the assembly process has been proven to be successful with both isotropic (spherical) and anisotropic (non-spherical) assembly components, which enables it to be applied {{to a wide range of}} biological specimens. Finally, an integrated theoretical model framework is also presented, which combines all of the key factors that play a role in determining assembly efficiency to produce guidelines for the design of the assembly system, so as to meet the constraints for successful assembly. In TASR, the system's free energy is minimized when components assemble in <b>holes</b> in the <b>template</b> surface that match the components' shapes and sizes. A combination of chemical and mechanical effects selectively removes all poorly matched components. Clonal isolate (SF 9) cells derived from the Spodoptera frugiperda (Fall Armyworm) IPLB-SF 21 -AE cells (with a mean diameter of 15 microns) and mouse-derived non-small lung cancer cells (with a mean diameter of 20 microns) were successfully assembled using TASR onto patterned silicon templates in separate sets of experiments. The assembly sites comprised holes with hemispherical profiles etched in a silicon substrate using plasma etching to match the nearly spherical shapes of the cells used. A high assembly yield of a 100 % and high cell density were observed for cell placement into sites with uniform diameters for both the cell lines. In addition, size selectivity was established for assembly into sets of heterogeneously patterned hemispherical sites with different diameters. High cell viability of nearly 99 % was recorded using multiple testing procedures, confirming predictions from theory that the assembly environment is favorable for the growth and survival of both mammalian as well as non-mammalian cells. These results confirmed model predictions that assembly would be successful with the materials studied here under the experimentally-used assembly parameters. The full set of models and experiments addressed the effects of compliance of the assembly components and templates, components and assembly sites shapes, and the chemical and mechanical properties of the assembly environment. Together, the results of these experiments and models demonstrate that TASR is indeed a very versatile tool for structuring biological systems. by Gunjan Agarwal. Thesis (Ph. D.)
