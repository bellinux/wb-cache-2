25|$|Acarines are {{extremely}} diverse. They live in practically every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predatory and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down <b>forest</b> <b>litter</b> and dead organic matter, such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops.|$|E

Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and rust mites (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.|$|E
500|$|Caloscypha is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Caloscyphaceae (order Pezizales). A {{monotypic}} genus, it contains the single species Caloscypha fulgens, {{commonly known as the}} spring orange peel fungus, the golden cup, or the dazzling cup. It is a cup fungus, typically up to [...] in diameter, with a bright to pale orange interior and orange; specimens that are old or bruised often have an olive-green discoloration, especially around the edges. In North America, it is usually found on the ground in <b>forest</b> <b>litter</b> near conifers. Fruiting occurs in early spring following snow melt. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of C.fulgens is the plant pathogenic species Geniculodendron pyriforme, known to infect dormant seeds of the Sitka spruce.|$|E
500|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter {{found on the}} forest floor, such as needle carpets. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow scattered, in groups, or in [...] under conifers (usually spruce and fir), and are often found on moss. In North America, it is found in California, Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, and the species is widely distributed in western and northern Europe. In Central America, the mushroom has been collected on the summit of Cerro de la Muerte in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica, on leaf litter of Comarostaphylis arbutoides (a highly branched evergreen shrub or tree in the heath family). In 2010, it was reported from Hokkaido in northern Japan, where it was found growing on Picea glehnii <b>forest</b> <b>litter</b> in early winter. It has also been recorded from North Africa.|$|E

40|$|Forest plantations, widely {{grown for}} wood production, involve the {{selective}} promotion of single-tree species or replacement of natural species by exotic tree species. Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) has been chosen for reforestation of infertile sandy soils in southeast Queensland, Australia. These exotic pine plantations minimize {{soil and water}} losses and are important scientific study sites. The soil environment of these plantations, though devoid of sufficient nutrients, organic carbon and other factors, harbors innumerable bacteria that may {{play a crucial role}} in maintaining soil quality and ecosystem functions. These soil microorganisms also have the potential for use as sensitive biological indicators to reflect environmental changes. It is therefore essential to understand the interrelationships among bacterial communities and their environment by assessing their structural and functional diversity and their responses to disturbances. The main aim of our investigation was to determine the diversity of bacterial communities in <b>forest</b> <b>litters</b> and soil during the <b>forest</b> leaf <b>litter</b> decomposition using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques...|$|R
40|$|Oribatid mites in litterbags and in {{soil samples}} were studied during one year. The litterbags with oak or beech litter were exposed in beech and spruce forest on the Kleť Mt. (Blanský les Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic). Four habitat-litter {{combinations}} were investigated - oak <b>litter</b> in beech <b>forest,</b> oak <b>litter</b> in spruce <b>forest,</b> beech <b>litter</b> in beech <b>forest</b> and beech <b>litter</b> in spruce <b>forest.</b> Soil samples {{were taken from}} oak, beech and spruce forests. Species diversity of oribatid mites increased with litter decomposition in the litterbags. Communities of oribatid mites in the litterbags exposed in spruce forest had higher species richness (59 species) than those exposed in beech forest (33 species). Species composition was dependent on the forest type where the litterbags were exposed. The influence of the litter type on the oribatid community was lower. Communities in the litterbags and in the soil samples were compared...|$|R
500|$|As a {{saprobic}} fungus, Sarcoscypha occidentalis {{is part of}} {{a community}} of fungi that {{play an important role in}} the forest ecosystem by breaking down the complex insoluble molecules cellulose and lignin of wood and leaf litter into smaller oligosaccharides that may be used by a variety of microbes. Fruit bodies of S.coccinea may grow either solitarily, scattered or grouped together on sticks, twigs, and fragments of dead wood, usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in the top [...] of soil and <b>forest</b> <b>litter.</b> It prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of humus. Like all Sarcoscypha species, it prefers the wood of angiosperms, such as oak, maple, and basswood; one field guide notes a preference for shagbark hickory. In the United States, it fruits from late spring to early autumn, which contrasts it with S.coccinea, found usually in the spring.|$|E

40|$|Soil cover {{transformation}} and changes of morphological and chemical properties of Albeluvisols in clear-cuttings of middle taiga spruce forests were studied. The observed changes in structure and properties of podzolic texturally-differentiated soils at cuttings of spruce {{forests in the}} middle taiga subzone do not cause their transition to any other soil type. Soil cover of secondary deciduous-coniferous forests which replace cut forests are characterized with a varied soil contour and {{a combination of the}} main type of podzolic soils under undisturbed spruce forests. The increased surface hydromorphism in cut areas causes formation of complicated sub-types of podzolic texturally differentiated soils (podzolic surface-gley soils with microprofile of podzol) and enlarges their ratio (up to 35 – 38 %) in soil cover structure. Temporary soil over-wetting at the initial (5 – 10 years) stage of after-cutting self-restoring vegetation succession provides for soil gleyzation, improves yield and segregation of iron compounds, increases the migratory activity of humic substances. Low content and resources of total nitrogen in <b>forest</b> <b>litters</b> mark anthropogenic transformation processes of podzolic soils at this stage. Later (in 30 – 40 years after logging), soils in cut areas still retain signs of hydromorphism. <b>Forest</b> <b>litters</b> are denser, less acidic and thick with a low weight ratio of organic carbon as compared with Albeluvisols of undisturbed spruce forest. The upper mineral soil horizons under secondary deciduous-coniferous forests contain larger amounts of total iron, its mobile (oxalate-dissolvable) components, and Fe-Mn-concretions...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effect of}} organic residue management {{on the growth}} and nutrition of Pinus pinaster Ait. seedlings, and on nutrient leaching and chemical properties of an acid soil was assessed through a lysimeter experiment. Treatments included absence, placement on the soil surface, and incorporation into the soil (with and without legume cover cropping) of organic residues (<b>forest</b> floor <b>litter</b> or <b>forest</b> floor <b>litter</b> plus harvest residues). • Residues placed on the soil surface enhanced seedling growth. Organic residues reduced nutrient losses (NO− 3, Ca andMg) and resulted in nutrient accumulation in the soil. Harvest residues positively affected K seedling nutrition status and enhanced K soil accumulation. • Legume cover cropping reduced soil nutrient losses (N, Ca, Mg and K) during the early stage of seedling growth; it also improved seedling nutrition status (N and P), but without any effect on growth. • Harvest residues plus <b>forest</b> floor <b>litter</b> placed on the soil surface was the most appropriate management to both reduce nutrient losses through leaching and increase height of seedlings {{at the end of}} the experimental period (two years) ...|$|R
40|$|Forest is an {{important}} resource for the farmers in soil fertility management and crop production in Bhutan. The tradition of leaf litter harvesting from the forests has been in practice since time immemorial. However, the continuous leaf litter harvesting has raised concerns on the sustainability of the leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests</b> (Sokshing). There is a paucity of information about harvesting practices, utilization and management of forests. Hence, the presentstudy was aimed at generating information on how farmers perceive, utilize and manage leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests.</b> Data were collected from two sub-districts Nahi and Limbukha in west-central Bhutan involving a total of forty farmers, using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and personal observations during field visits to the forests. The study found that despite having access to chemical fertilizers, soil fertility management for the farmers is mainly based {{on the use of}} leaf litters as farmyard manure (FYM). Given the labour intensive nature of FYM production, aggravated by labour shortages, farmers still preferred FYM over chemical fertilizers. Quercus griffithii, Q. lanata and Pinus spp. were the main leaf litter tree species in the studied areas; Quercus spp. being the most preferred by farmers. The complete removal of litters from the leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests</b> as revealed by farmers will not only have negative effects on nutrient cycling in the leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests</b> but also render the exposed ground vulnerable to erosion. During litter harvesting farmers’ clearing the regenerations in leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests</b> as found in the present study, will exacerbate the already thinly populated <b>litter</b> <b>forests</b> resulting in declining productivity and ultimately the sustainability of leaf <b>litter</b> <b>forests.</b> Traditional practice of leaf litter harvesting will continue for perpetuity for the mountain farmers, therefore, sustainable management practices will have to be found and put in practice based on participatory approache...|$|R
