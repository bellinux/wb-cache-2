5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} by different methods, <b>described</b> <b>below.</b> Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.|$|E

5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types <b>described</b> <b>below</b> is difficult.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, <b>described</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
40|$|The shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) {{technique}} {{transforms the}} traditional nuclear shell-model problem into a path-integral over auxiliary fields.

30|$|We {{have seen}} that Bernstein’s coordinate-free {{reformulation}} of the trace {{in the category of}} finite dimensional vector spaces is captured by the categorical trace of JSV. However, Bernstein’s parametric trace motivates a notion of relative trace, in the sense of JSV that we <b>describe</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
30|$|Barakol was {{prepared}} in methanol in concentration of 20  μg/mL. Samples {{were analyzed by}} HPLC as <b>describe</b> <b>below.</b> One peak of barakol should be found. UV spectra of barakol were scanned between 200 and 400  nm by diode-array detector. The maximum absorbance was collected.|$|R
5|$|As <b>described</b> <b>below,</b> Apollonius' {{problem has}} ten special cases, {{depending}} {{on the nature of}} the three given objects, which may be a circle (C), line (L) or point (P). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as CCP. Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and straightedge constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.|$|E
5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere. The planar Apollonius problem can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones <b>described</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal.

5|$|In 1920 Neubronner {{found that}} {{ten years of}} hard work and {{considerable}} expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (<b>described</b> <b>below),</b> had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's panoramic camera is displayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} {{forecasts}} of health detriment for such long periods {{should be examined}} critically. Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research. Management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are <b>described</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E

The IB recommends a minimum of 240 hours of instructional time for HL courses and 150 hours for SL courses.|$|E
