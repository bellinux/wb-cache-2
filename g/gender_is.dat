5|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the main}} social {{determinants}} of health—which include social, economic, and political factors—that {{play a major role in}} the health outcomes of women in India. Therefore, the high level of gender inequality in India negatively impacts the health of women.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E
5|$|The social view {{of health}} {{combined}} with the acknowledgement that <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> a social determinant of health inform women's health service delivery in countries around the world. Women's health services such as Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre which was established in 1974 {{and was the first}} women's health centre established in Australia is an example of women's health approach to service delivery.|$|E

30|$|In addition, we {{examined}} demographic variables (age, gender, years of education, and income) as possible covariates. <b>Gender</b> <b>was</b> correlated with relational crafting (r =  0.24, p <  0.01). <b>Gender</b> <b>was</b> thus added into the structural model, as an antecedent to relational crafting.|$|R
30|$|Similar to the {{previous}} studies, <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> a controversial factor associated with mortality risk in the study. In the Elixhauser model, <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> not a significant factor to predict mortality, but in the DCI model, males had significantly higher in-hospital mortality risk than females. This finding was also consistent with COPD mortality odds ratio of male (OR[*]=[*] 1.17, CI[*]=[*] 1.07 - 1.27) reported.(5) However, after making the Bonferroni correction, <b>gender</b> <b>was</b> no longer a predictor of in-hospital mortality in the DCI model.|$|R
5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> {{consistently}} {{marked on}} 2nd singular, and on 2nd and 3rd plural. <b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> not consistently marked on 3rd singular and 1st plural. <b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> never marked on 1st singular.|$|E
25|$|The {{masculine}} <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> {{also the}} indeterminate gender {{as in many}} other Indo-European languages. This means that for an entire mixed group of objects belonging to masculine and feminine genders, the masculine <b>gender</b> <b>is</b> used. The masculine as the indeterminate gender differs from the indefinite gender, which allows treatment of the word in two ways.|$|E

Feminine <b>gender</b> agreement <b>is</b> {{used to refer to}} female referents, whilst nonfeminine <b>gender</b> agreement <b>is</b> used for all other referents. The two <b>genders</b> <b>are</b> only distinguished in third person singular. Aihkenvald (2007) considers the bipartite <b>gender</b> system to <b>be</b> inherited from Proto-Arawak.|$|R

40|$|In {{research}} on grammatical gender, assignment and agreement {{are the two}} central notions. <b>Genders</b> <b>are</b> defined as systems of agreement classes, and the assignment of nouns to <b>genders</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the agreement they consistently trigger on associated elements. Yet, gender assignment and <b>gender</b> agreement <b>are</b> often discussed quite separately. This paper investigates the possibility that <b>gender</b> agreement <b>is</b> not only an overt manifestation of gender assignment, but that properties of agreement systems can themselves constrain the assignment systems they express. The paper discusses typological and diachronic evidence {{for the fact that}} not every type of assignment system can be expressed in every type of agreement system...|$|R

25|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>is</b> {{the range}} of {{characteristics}} pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity.|$|E
