6000|$|In {{the morning}} he changed his mind, led partly by some dim foreshadowing of {{the result of his}} {{literary}} adventure; for the little book took all Scotland by storm. Not only scholars and literary men, but [...] "even plowboys and maid servants," [...] says a contemporary, eagerly spent their hard-earned shillings for the new book. Instead of going to Jamaica, the young poet hurried to Edinburgh to arrange <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> his work. His journey was a constant ovation, and in the capital he was welcomed and feasted by the best of Scottish society. This inexpected triumph lasted only one winter. Burns's fondness for taverns and riotous living shocked his cultured entertainers, and when he returned to Edinburgh next winter, after a pleasure jaunt through the Highlands, he received scant attention. He left the city in anger and disappointment, {{and went back to the}} soil where he was more at home.|$|E

6000|$|In 1814 he {{made his}} second tour in Scotland, visiting Yarrow in company with the Ettrick Shepherd. During this year [...] "the Excursion" [...] was published, in an <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> five hundred copies, which {{supplied}} the demand <b>for</b> six years. <b>Another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> {{the same number of}} copies was published in 1827, and not exhausted till 1834. In 1815 [...] "The White Doe of Rylstone" [...] appeared, and in 1816 [...] "A Letter to a Friend of Burns," [...] in which Wordsworth gives his opinion upon the limits to be observed by the biographers of literary men. It contains many valuable suggestions, but allows hardly scope enough for personal details, to which he was constitutionally indifferent.[347] Nearly the same date may be ascribed to a rhymed translation of the first three books of the Aeneid, a specimen of which was printed in the Cambridge [...] "Philological Museum" [...] (1832). In 1819 [...] "Peter Bell," [...] written twenty years before, was published, and, perhaps in consequence of the ridicule of the reviewers, found a more rapid sale than any of his previous volumes. [...] "The Wagoner," [...] printed in the same year, was less successful. His next publication was the volume of Sonnets on the river Duddon, with some miscellaneous poems, 1820. A tour on the Continent in 1820 furnished the subjects <b>for</b> <b>another</b> collection, published in 1822. This was followed in the same year by the volume of [...] "Ecclesiastical Sketches." [...] His subsequent publications were [...] "Yarrow Revisited," [...] 1835, and the tragedy of [...] "The Borderers," [...] 1842.|$|R
6000|$|Murray {{had paid}} Byron £2710 {{for the three}} tragedies, {{and in order to}} protect the copyright, he applied, through counsel (Lancelot Shadwell, {{afterwards}} Vice-Chancellor), for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale <b>of</b> piratical <b>editions</b> <b>of</b> Cain. In delivering judgment (February 12, 1822), the Chancellor, Lord Eldon (see Courier, Wednesday, February 13), replying to Shadwell, drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost, [...] "which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation--solicitæ jucunda oblivia vitæ." [...] No one, he argued, could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were [...] "not to bring into disrepute," [...] but [...] "to promote reverence for our religion," [...] and, per contra, no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to [...] "the Preface, the poem, the general tone and manner of Cain." [...] It was a question for a jury. A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous, and void of copyright; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book, and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive, he was compelled to refuse the injunction. According to Dr. Smiles (Memoir of John Murray, 1891, i. 428), the decision of a jury was taken, and an injunction eventually granted. If so, it was ineffectual, <b>for</b> Benbow issued <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> Cain in 1824 (see Jacob's Reports, p. 474, note). See, too, the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another, as reported in the Examiner, February 17, 1822; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker, Southey v. Sherwood, Murray v. Benbow, and Lawrence v. Smith [Quarterly Review, April, 1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 120-138].|$|R

She {{attended}} a workshop at IFBA International Film and Broadcast Academy, where she learnt of an MNet sponsored project called [...] "New Directions". The company was looking for short stories, and she sent in the short script, titled [...] "The Special Gele". The script was eventually selected, along with four other semi finalists. Although she didn't win the competition, she got the encouragement she needed to push further. Two years later, She entered <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the same competition and won, with her script converted into a short film; she competed the following year and won again.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 it {{was time}} <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the European Championships. Storp managed a throw of 19.39 metres, which was enough to secure a fourth place. Both the bronze {{medalist}} and the silver medalist, who was her countryfellow Astrid Kumbernuss, threw 19.49 metres. Storp did not compete at the next major event, the 1995 World Indoor Championships. At the 1995 World Championships, she once again underperformed {{in the final round}} with a throw of 18.81 metres. This time, it was enough for an eighth place, tied with seventh but losing on countback (measuring the second best throw in the competition). Astrid Kumbernuss won the event, with Kathrin Neimke in fourth place. Storp's season's best was only 18.95, achieved in July in London. 1996 was an Olympic year, and Storp was selected for her second Olympic Games. With 19.06 metres she finished sixth in the Olympic shot put final, one place ahead of Kathrin Neimke while Kumbernuss again won the event.|$|E
5000|$|The Apertura {{schedule}} was unveiled {{on the second}} week of July and the club decided to return their home games on Sundays afternoon after their last season experiment of playing on Saturdays seeking for better assistances didnt throw the expected results. In week 6, Motagua faced C.D. Social Sol at home; in the 50 minute (0-0), the referee decided to suspend the match due to heavy rain which caused a power outage. The remaining 40 minutes were played the following morning, landing in the clubs 88th anniversary. Román Castillo who had lost his younger brother a week prior, decided the match with a late goal at the 90th+5 minute. [...] On 25 September, Motagua had to move its home game against C.D. Honduras Progreso to Catacamas due to a religious event that took place at Estadio Tiburcio Carías Andino. [...] This match at Catacamas marked history in the Honduran Liga Nacional as the first game ever officiated by a female referee. [...] On week 17, a 2-2 away tie against Real C.D. España defined Motaguas 4th place in the regular season standings and therefore, a berth to the playoffs phase. [...] Once in the playoffs, Motagua defeated C.D. Marathón away in postseason {{for the first time since}} November 1990; however, the access to the semifinals didnt turned out that easy as Motagua had to rely on a late and controversial penalty in the second leg to advance with a 3-3 global score. [...] In the semifinals Motagua faced city rivals Club Deportivo Olimpia <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Honduran Superclásico, resulting in the fourth time these two teams meet in this stage in the last three years. With a 2-1 aggregated score, Motagua moved on and qualified to their 19th league final in history. [...] On 18 December, Motagua obtained their 14th national championship after defeating Platense F.C. in an unprecedented final. [...] It was also the first time a league title was decided at Puerto Cortés. With the win, the team secured a spot for the 2017-18 in CONCACAF club competitions.|$|E
40|$|Ah, {{hear that}} old piano, {{from down the}} avenue. ” Every Saturday at 6 : 00 pm, at home in Alfred or {{on the coast of}} Maine or in Chapel Hill, I can count on hearing those words, “coming to you live from the Fitzgerald Theatre. ” It’s time to settle in <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> A Prairie Home Companion. The show’s {{familiarity}} is comforting. I know just what to expect: The Adventures of Guy Noir (Private Eye), Dusty and Lefty, The Guys’ All- Star Shoe Band, faux ads for Powdermilk Biscuits and The Duct Tape Council, lots of music and singing, and, finally, The News From Lake Wobegon. In a way that would warm Aristotle’s heart, the show has a beginning, middle, and end. For many years it concluded with credits for its writers and producers: Oliver Closoff, Hedda Lettuce, Marian Haste, Mahatma Koat, Ivana Huginkis, Natalie Dressed, Warren Peace, and Anna Conda, among others. In short, Garrison Keillor has created a little world, and much of its pleasure comes from anticipating a favorite part. For me that means hearing from the Ketchup Advisory Council. Some years ago I realized I was doing something like that with the Alfred University Honors Program, at first unconsciously, but then on purpose. Like A Prairie Home Companion, our program has its predictable rhythm, events students look forward to. The year begins with “Death by Chocolate” where freshmen meet the upperclassmen and get a head start on gaining their freshman fifteen. There’s a make-your-own-cookie party at Christmas, then dinner for seniors at the president’s house, and finally a year-end banquet, featuring student and faculty entertainment and another cascade of chocolate desserts. Like A Prairie Home Companion’s world, which trades heavily on parody of radio culture with its mock ads and retro sound effects, Alfred’s “honors culture” works in part by gently making fun of some of the more pretentious aspects of university life...|$|E

40|$|Mr. Sprent laid on {{the table}} some copies of a {{geological}} map of Tasmania, prepared at the Crown Lands department. The work was initiated {{at the request of}} the Hon. N. J. Brown, Minister of Lands and Works, and was intended to accompany the " Crown Lands Guide" issued by the department. It has frequently been represented to the Government that Mr. Gould's maps and reports should be republished for general information, but as to do so would entail a great amount of unnecessary labour, it was decided to embody Mr. Gould's work in a general map, and to incorporate therein all the most reliable information obtainable from other sources. Mr. Sprent, finding that Mr. R. M. Johnston was independently engaged upon the preparation of a descriptive account of the geology of Tasmania, agreed to join forces with that gentleman. Several gentlemen, on being consulted, agreed to give information, but a great difficulty was experienced in reconciling statements, it was determined to prepare a map from the materials at hand, and then distribute it amongst those who were likely to take an interest in adding to and correcting it. The map now issued does not claim to be a reliable record of ascertained geological facts; it is put forward rather as a guide, and as an incentive to further work in the same direction; there being no complete geological survey of Tasmania, it is impossible to attain to more than approximate accuracy. The authors therefore offer this map as their contribution towards a future and more elaborate work. It will be found to give a clear and fairly accurate delineation of the leading geological features of the colony as far as it is possible to delineate them upon a map of small scale. Mr. Johnston is now engaged upon the letterpress portion of the work, but as it is necessarily a work of his spare hours it will not be ready for some months yet. In the meantime Mr. Johnston and Mr. Sprent will be grateful to any gentlemen who will furnish them with information that may be made available <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the map...|$|E
