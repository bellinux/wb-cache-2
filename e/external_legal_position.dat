5000|$|The Austrian bishops {{proceeded}} to the First Vatican Council {{immediately after the}} conflict over the Concordat. Rauscher regarded the assembly with the greatest hopes and issued two pastorals dealing with the council on 15 November 1869. Pope Pius IX appointed him to the commission pro recipiendis, which had to investigate all motions submitted. At the first real session of the council (the General Congregation of 28 December) he delivered the first address, and twice spoke against the opportuneness of a universal catechism; the needs and the degrees of culture of the individual peoples were too different. As to the question which finally most strongly stirred {{the minds of those}} in and outside the council, that of the infallibility of the pope teaching ex cathedra, Rauscher was the leader of the bishops who combatted the expediency of the definition. His work, [...] "Observationes quædam de infallibilitatis ecclesiæ subjecto", appeared at Naples, and was reprinted at Vienna; the author later explained that it [...] "was especially intended to emphasize the fact that the proposed decision would afford parties hostile to the Church those subterfuges of which they were in need". In the general debate Rauscher, who was ill, had his speech read by Bishop Hefele; it lasted over an hour, and ends characteristically: [...] "But always shall I adore the ways of the Lord", He repeatedly took part in the special debates (8, 9, and 15 June), and at the ballot in the General Congregation of 13 July he voted non placet. However, he did not sign the memorial of the fifty-five bishops of the minority to Pius IX on 17 July, believing he had done all that he should. On 17 July he took leave of the pope, and later, as Archbishop of Vienna, promulgated the doctrinal decrees of the Vatican Council. He protested the suppression of the Papal States, on 20 September 1870. In May 1874 Austrian laws concerning the <b>external</b> <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of the Catholic Church, the contributions to the religious funds, and the legal recognition of religious societies were issued.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Church Polity)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{variety of}} {{contradictory}} {{approaches to the}} <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of religion in South Africa as are apparent from court findings, theological discourse and church practice are indicative {{of a lack of}} clarity, and even confusion, regarding a matter that is of cardinal importance to the orderly functioning of the church as the body of Christ on earth. From this confusion in constitutional law {{as well as in the}} church, the topicality - actually, the undeniable necessity - of research into the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of religion has become quite apparent. The topicality of the research is indicated in Chapter 1 by reference to court cases (before and after 1996), theological discourse and church practice. The central research question of the study is formulated as follows: What is the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of Reformed ministers in South Africa - a religiously neutral state - considered on the basis of Reformed Church polity and against the background of the church-state context in South Africa after 1996 ? The central theoretical argument of the study is that the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of a minister of religion is a unique kind of relationship (alius generis), a relationship / association / connection / obligation that has to be regulated by the church as a unique community (sui generis) in the world. In South Africa courts should recognise and deem the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of Reformed ministers to be an internal church matter that falls outside the sphere of regulation of a religiously neutral state's labour legislation. This recognition should be based on the right of the church to define itself and its offices. In Chapter 2 the current confusion in South Africa regarding the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of religion is investigated further. Various points of view are discussed, for example that ministers are 'employees' of churches (church councils), that a minister's <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> has to be regarded as that of an independent contractor and the point of view that ministers are connected to the church by a unique relationship. The way in which the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of the Gospel is regarded in Germany is discussed in Chapter 3. The focus is inter alia on the meaning of religious freedom, neutrality of the state, constitutional provisions regarding the relationship between the state and the church, and the way in which the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of religion is regulated in the light of the German state-church context. The way in which the Reformed Churches in South Africa define and regulate the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of Reformed ministers as an internal church matter is investigated in Chapter 4. In this chapter the focus is on the following aspects: the order of the church that applies to the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers in terms of Reformed church polity, as expressed in the church order, the meaning of a minister's relationship with the local church as regards his <b>legal</b> <b>position,</b> and the unique nature of a minister's <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> in terms of the relevant provisions of the church ordinances. The findings, recommendations and summary conclusion of the study are given in Chapter 5. The summary conclusion of the study is that an overall impression of the regulation of ministers' positions by the Reformed Churches in South Africa offers the following perspective: the Lord places the church and its ministers in a unique relationship. This relationship must be regulated by means of the church because the church ordinances inherently make provision for the regulation of this unique relationship. Regarded within the broad context of this study, the state may not exercise control over the <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> of ministers of religion because these ministers fulfil a religiously determined command and task.

They {{have the right to}} receive crime victim compensation from the state. In a criminal law sense these children do not have an explicit <b>legal</b> <b>position,</b> since {{they do not have the}} status as plaintiffs. The aim of the present study is to examine what consequences this insecure <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> might lead to. The study compare the situation in Sweden with the situation in Norway for these children. In Norway, children who witness {{domestic violence}} have a more explicit <b>legal</b> <b>position,</b> in consideration of their status as plaintiffs. Method and data: The primary empirical data consists of individual interviews with six persons. Four works within the Swedish police and two of them works within the Norwegian police. The secondary data consists of publications, legislation and documents regarding the topic of the study. Through an analysis of the secondary data several questions arose, which could be answered through the primary data. Results: The results from the study shows that the consequences of the insecure <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> these children have, makes it very difficult for the police to discover them and be able to give them the help they are entitled to. By giving these children a more explicit <b>legal</b> <b>position</b> as plaintiffs it will be a statement that this question is taken seriously and make them more visible...|$|R
