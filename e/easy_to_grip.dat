40|$|Embolization of {{catheter}} fragments or fractured spring guidewires {{used during}} cardiac catheterization or fractured {{central venous pressure}} (CVP) lines is not uncommon. Although CVP lines are usually used in seriously ill patients, often with complications secondary to prior surgical intervention, if the catheter fragments are not removed they can give rise to serious illness or death in about 50 % of patients. Experience with the removal of nine such catheter fragments is reported. In eight patients a helical basket was available for removal through a Dotter retrieval catheter. With prolonged hyperalimentation therapy polyethylene catherters become very brittle. They are relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> with the wire basket. Silicone elastomer catheters remain pliable but are so bouncy that they are difficult to grip. For removal of catheter fragments from vessels of small diameter, such as the subclavian vein, or vessels in which the catheter has to take an acute bend to enter, such as the right or left pulmonary artery, a smaller, more pliable Bean-Smith-Mahorner biliary stone helical basket was adapted by extending the length of wire to 100 cm. For removal of catheter fragments from the right pulmonary artery it is probably better to use a softer, 100 -cm-long no. 8 French right heart catheter.

40|$|It can be {{expected}} that many elderly people have impaired opening capacity of food packaging bearing in mind the changes in functionality and physical strength that occur during ageing. This study determined {{the relation of the}} quantitative force required to open selected food packaging systems with findings derived from qualitative focus group studies to retrieve comprehensive information on the specific needs of seniors. The focus group studies revealed that the assessment of the ease of opening is very subjective and can vary from objective measurements. The quantitative measurement of the force required to open the ‘easy to open’ thermoformed tray resulted in considerably higher peel initiation forces of 22. 50 [*]±[*] 1. 62 [*]N compared to the standard tray (12. 80 [*]±[*] 1. 93 [*]N). However, the packaging type was still felt to be easier to open because of the enlarged tab and peeling corner, which was said to be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip.</b> Conversely, the stand-up pouches with twist-off caps could only be opened with difficulty because of the small caps and the difficulty in breaking seals, despite the substantially lower opening forces of 0. 46 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [*]Nm compared with the other torque closures. The evaluation of a package was found to be only partly dependent on the required opening force but strongly influenced by various design factors and consumer's expectations as well as experiences...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Longer use and {{responsible}} disposal of rapidly discarded consumer electronics would slow material throughput and reduce metal extraction rates and associated environmental impacts. Although longevity is technically achievable, extending product lifetimes is more challenging when devices become ‘tired’, ‘worn’ or ‘damaged’ as these attributes {{are believed to}} result in loss of value, dissatisfaction and premature disposal. “Materials mediate the aging process in a tangible and immediate way” (Chapman, 2014, p. 141), thus users’ sustained appreciation of materials will often determine a product’s longevity regardless of physical durability and functional lifespan. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} user-centred study which explores tactile and aesthetic responses to new and artificially aged mobile phone cases made from leather, titanium, cork, plastic, rubber, walnut and bamboo. The results indicate that preferences for the materials tested were extremely subjective, and even a single participant was likely to have conflicting requirements for the characteristics of the materials (for example, sleek and shiny yet <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip).</b> Participants’ preconceptions about the meaning and function of materials in a particular context strongly influenced their responses. The ageing process had no effect on the position of the samples materials in preference order, but the comments provided by participants gave useful insights into the variety of ways that wear and damage can be interpreted by different people for different materials in a particular context...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a thesis {{in the context}} of the {{engineering}} education Ergonomic Design and Production at Luleå University of Technology that includes 30 hp. The work began in 2007 in collaboration with the knife manufacturer Mora of Sweden. The company wanted to enter the market for kitchen knives and formulated a mission statement: to develop a series of kitchen knives, identify what kind of knifes that should be included in such series and to develop packaging and display material for the series. The work would be based on a market and user study and the design would be based on Mora of Sweden’s design manual. The process that was used for the work began with an exploratory phase including interviews, observations and questionnaires with both professional users and ordinary consumers. Based on the survey the work identified user needs and established a product specification based on user needs, the requirements of the manufacturer and the theory of antropometry and hand ergonomics. The next phase was a concept generating phase with brainstorming and sketching. After sorting out four concepts followed a concept selection phase that began with visualization of the four concepts both through renderings and prototypes to be tested by users. After this phase the work took a break and was addressed again in 2015 with the last phase of the concept selection process that was based on the user’s opinion and a decision matrix. The concept chosen was a knife handle made of plastic with a dark gray rubber surface and lime green accents. The handle is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> and is designed so that the user can easily switch position of the hand to keep the knife balanced during various operations. The design harmonize with Mora of Sweden design manual by the simple curved line that divides the handle into two surfaces and the concave and convex surfaces that come together in a smooth transition. Based on the information collected from users and benchmarking the work identified five kinds of knives that should be included in the series: large chef's knife, bread knife, fillet knife, paring knife and small chef’s knife. A proposal for a packaging material was developed from the knife concept and Mora of Sweden design manual. The package can both be adapted for a smaller series of knives and for individual knives and picks up the shape of Mora of Sweden logotype and shows the silhouette images of which knives are inside. Because the work was paused for a long time the result was no longer of relevant to Mora of Sweden but the work nonetheless presented proposals on how the concept could be further developed.

50|$|The {{official}} {{rules of}} the National Football League require footballs to be inflated to a gauge pressure between 12.5 and 13.5 {{pounds per square inch}} (psi) or 86 to 93 kPa, when measured by the referees. The rules do not specify the temperature at which such measurement is to be made. Per the pressure-temperature law, there is a positive correlation between the temperature and pressure of a gas with a fixed volume and mass. Thus, if a football were inflated to the minimum pressure of 12.5 psi at room temperature, the pressure would drop below the minimum as the gases inside cooled to the colder ambient temperature on the playing field. While footballs deflate naturally in colder temperatures, a deliberately under-inflated football may be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip,</b> throw, and catch, or inhibit fumbling, especially in cold rainy conditions.|$|R
50|$|A {{carpenter}} pencil (carpentry pencil, carpenter's pencil) is a pencil {{that has a}} body with a rectangular or elliptical cross-section {{to prevent it from}} rolling away. Carpenter pencils are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> than standard pencils, because they have a larger surface area. The non-round core allows thick or thin lines to be drawn by rotating the pencil. Thin lines are required for high precision markings and are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> erase, but thick markings are needed to mark on rough surfaces. The lead is strong to withstand the stress of marking on such surfaces. The pencil is robust to survive in a construction environment, for example when placed in a bag together with heavy tools. The core is often stronger than in other pencils. Carpenter pencils are also used by builders, because they are suitable for marking on rough surfaces, such as concrete or stone. This shape and lead density aid in marking legible lines with a straight edge that are clear and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> follow with a saw blade.|$|R

50|$|Synthetic rope - There are 4 common ropes in use. Polyester, {{also called}} Dacron or Terylene, is a strong, low stretch rope, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging. Nylon is a strong, but elastic rope, used for mooring lines and anchor warps as it resists shock loads. It is usually laid (twisted) {{so that it}} is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> when hauling. Polypropylene is a light, cheap, {{slippery}} rope, that floats. It is much weaker than the previous ropes. It weakens when exposed to sunlight. It is usually laid construction. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets. Kevlar is an extremely strong fibre that is now made into ropes with almost no stretch. Expensive. Suited to halyards instead of stainless steel wire. Often used on racing yachts to replace polyester when powerful winches are used. Kevlar ropes can be much smaller in diameter than polyester for the same strength. This saves windage on a racing yacht. Usually braided.|$|R

50|$|One {{focus of}} {{ergonomic}} principles is maintaining neutral postures, which are postures in which muscles {{are at their}} normal length and able to generate the most force, while reducing stress and possible injury to muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones- therefore, in the workplace or in everyday life, it is ideal for muscles and joints to maintain neutral positions. Additionally, to prevent hand, wrist, and finger injuries, understanding when <b>to</b> use pinch <b>grips</b> (best for fine motor control and precise movements with low force) and power grips (best for high-force movements done repeatedly) is important for employees and general tasks outside the workplace. The choice of tools should match that of the proper grip and be conducive to neutral postures, which is important for employers to consider when purchasing equipment. In order to reduce injuries to the low back and spine, it is recommended to reduce weight and frequency of lifting cycles as well as decreasing {{the distance between the}} body and the load to reduce the torque force on the back for workers and individuals doing repeated lifting to avoid fatigue failure of the spine.
