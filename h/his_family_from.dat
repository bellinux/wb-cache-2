5|$|After {{struggling}} for {{a breakthrough in}} film, Chastain had six releases in 2011, getting wide recognition for her roles in several of them. The first of these roles was as the wife of Michael Shannon's character in Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter. The drama {{tells the story of}} a troubled father who tries to protect <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> an impending storm. It was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and the critic Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative. She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for the film.|$|E
5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling him and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> Syria, Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July {{with only one}} of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Around 1934, {{he began}} working as a {{lecturer}} in economics at the City of London College. Upon his retirement from the university in 1958, Aaronson was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, in recognition of more than twenty-five years of service. The same year he moved with <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> London to Harpenden in Hertfordshire, where he later died from coronary heart disease and heart failure on 9 December 1966, {{at the age of}} 71. He was buried in the Westfield Road Cemetery in Harpenden. His wife and young son survived him.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol building by {{the time of}} McCreary's inauguration, he was able to move the official governor's office out of the governor's mansion, freeing <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> the intrusion of public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office {{is believed to be the}} last official act performed by a governor there.|$|E
5|$|Brin {{immigrated to}} the United States with <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union {{at the age of}} 6. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, {{following}} in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he later became friends. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{grew up in}} Massillon, Ohio, {{where he}} moved with <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> Norwalk when he was nine years of age. His father, Lester, was a {{dispatcher}} for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Massillon was a shipping and steel town obsessed with its high school and professional football teams, both called the Tigers. Massillon's main rival at both levels was nearby Canton, {{at the time a}} bigger and richer town. When the professional teams folded in the 1920s, the rivalry between the high school teams took center stage.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{life became}} more {{difficult}} for the family: Priestley was burned in effigy along with Thomas Paine; vicious political cartoons continued to be published about him; letters were sent to him from across the country, comparing him to the devil and Guy Fawkes; tradespeople feared the family's business; and Priestley's Royal Academy friends distanced themselves. As the penalties became harsher for those who spoke out against the government, Priestley examined options for removing himself and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> England.|$|E
5|$|Danish {{raids on}} England continued, and Æthelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when King Swein I of Denmark drove Æthelred and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed Æthelred to return home, but Swein's son Cnut contested Æthelred's return. Æthelred died {{unexpectedly}} in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. Æthelred and Emma's two sons, Edward and Alfred, went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.|$|E

5|$|Ealdred was {{probably}} {{born in the}} west of England, and {{could be related to}} Lyfing, his predecessor as bishop of Worcester. <b>His</b> <b>family,</b> <b>from</b> Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became Abbot of Gloucester. Ealdred was a monk in the cathedral chapter at Winchester Cathedral before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043. Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death. No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden String Quartet. During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> the sentiment {{he was trying to}} convey through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E

5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It {{was the last time}} that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E
5|$|Norman Selfe (9 December 1839– 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, naval architect, inventor, urban planner and outspoken {{advocate}} of technical education. After emigrating to Sydney with <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> England {{as a boy}} he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel cantilever bridge across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He moved <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>from</b> Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began {{searching for the}} antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
