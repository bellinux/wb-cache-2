50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>sungem</b> (Heliactin bilophus) is a South American hummingbird, {{the only}} species, (monotypic), {{of the genus}} Heliactin. The {{scientific}} name bilophus is sometimes considered a nomen oblitum, which, if accepted, results in Heliactin cornutus being the correct name for this species. It occurs in Bolivia, Brazil, and Suriname. It prefers fairly dry open or semi-open habitats, such as savanna and Cerrado. It avoids dense humid forest.|$|E

This study aimed to {{identify}} the plant species most often visited by H. bilophus with feeding purposes (consumption of nectar) {{during the rainy season}} at Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, Goi√°s. Observations were made during two rainy seasons (January 2006 and February 2008). The methodology consisted of walking through trails within two areas of campo sujo and two areas of campo rupestre. The record of an individual consuming the nectar of a flowering plant was considered to constitute a visit. A total of 296 visits were observed, comprising eight species of shrubs and herbs. The most often visited plant species were Bauhinia tenella (Caesalpinoideae) and Vochysia pumila (Vochysiaceae) in campo sujo, and Lychnophora ericoides (Asteraceae) in campo rupestre. These three species were commonly found at the study sites. In both physiognomies, Heliactin bilophus consumed the nectar of few plant species. The most frequently visited species bore high numbers of flowers...|$|E
