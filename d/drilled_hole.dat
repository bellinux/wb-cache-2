5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a <b>drilled</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E

30|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of phenolic resin was impregnated through <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in wood, and we manufactured compressed wood with the deformation fixed by the phenolic resin. The methods of impregnation {{used in this}} study were an in-liquid platen-pressing method and a vacuum treatment. The effect of the <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> on solution retention was examined. Moreover, the control of solution retention was examined under the application of compression drying. The impregnation of resin into the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> was insufficient, and the deformation could not be fixed. On the other hand, sufficient impregnation was possible in the specimen with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes,</b> and the deformation fixation was observed. At the stage of compression when the solution was squeezed out of the specimen, the solution retention of each specimen was accurately controlled in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b> At the stage of compressive deformation and deformation fixation using a hot press, the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> could not be processed normally because swelling occurred. However, swelling did not occur in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally <b>drilled</b> <b>hole</b> (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E

2500|$|Holes {{through a}} PCB are {{typically}} drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and high feed to be cost effective. Drill bits must also remain sharp {{so as not}} to mar or tear the traces. Drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards. The drilling is performed by automated drilling machines with placement controlled by a drill tape or drill file. These computer-generated files are also called numerically controlled drill (NCD) files or [...] "Excellon files". The drill file describes the location and size of each <b>drilled</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

30|$|Other {{groups have}} shown a benefit to using Steinmann pin {{constructs}} to fix proximal tibia defects. Randall et al. looked at proximal tibia defects fixed with either PMMA alone or PMMA with intramedullary Steinmann pins [5]. They also examined the effect of placing different sized <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> into the intact portion of the proximal tibia. The authors found the tibias in the small <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> group (5 -mm <b>drill</b> <b>holes)</b> had more cycles to failure and a greater load to failure in the groups with Steinmann pin reconstruction. They found no such difference between pin reconstruction and no-pin reconstruction when 10 -mm <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> were placed into the intact portion of the proximal tibia.

2500|$|Installer bits, {{also known}} as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the <b>drilled</b> <b>hole.</b> These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|E

40|$|While <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> it is {{extremely}} important that the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> are <b>drilled</b> as straight as possible. Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. <b>Drill</b> <b>hole</b> deviation is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ). In the first drift, the production <b>holes</b> were <b>drilled</b> with a 115 mm drill bit, and in the second a drill bit of 105 mm. This is based on a project “Klenare borrhål” initiated by LKAB Wassara, a subsidiary of LKAB. LKAB Wassara wished to evaluate a possible reduction of <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> diameter from the current 115 mm, to 105 mm. If the project had positive outcome, further attempts with an even smaller borehole diameter of 89 mm would be tested. There will also be curvature measurements as part of the evaluation of Wassaras new drill hammer, W 90. The results of the measurements show that the average deviation of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a larger diameter drill bit had much higher deviation than for the smaller diameter <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a smaller drill bit...|$|R

40|$|Yucca Mountain in {{southern}} Nye County, Nevada, {{has been proposed}} as a potential site for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste. An exploratory <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and {{the bottom of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations are part of an important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. These units are, in ascending order, the tuff of Yucca Flat(?), an unnamed calcified ash-flow tuff, and a sequence of clastic deposits. The upper part of the Tertiary sequence in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 is similar to that found in other <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. The Tertiary sequence is in fault contact with the Silurian rocks. This fault between Tertiary and Paleozoic rocks may correlate with the Fran Ridge fault, a steeply westward-dipping fault exposed approximately 0. 5 km east of the <b>drill</b> <b>hole.</b> Another fault intersects UE 25 p# 1 at 873 m (2863 ft), but its surface trace is concealed beneath the valley west of the Fran Ridge fault.
