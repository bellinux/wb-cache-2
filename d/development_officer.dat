5|$|Pick became traffic <b>development</b> <b>officer</b> in 1909 and {{commercial}} manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed {{that the best way to}} do so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{complexity}} and rapid {{pace of change}} demand more from people responsible for regional development at various levels of activity. This paper {{has its roots in}} a belief that the more complex situations are the more regional development is dependent on the leadership and network management capacity of key individuals. It suggests that by studying more deeply the roles that various individuals, and coalitions formed by them, have in institutionalisation, deinstitutionalisation and reinstitutionalisation processes might provide us with additional analytical leverage in regional development studies. This paper focuses on diffuse networks of dispersed powers from a Finnish regional <b>development</b> <b>officer's</b> point of view. Regional <b>development</b> <b>officers</b> are those people {{whose job it is to}} boost the economic development of their respective regions in Finland. The research questions discussed here are: a) What kind of power is exercised by Finnish regional development officers; and b) how do regional <b>development</b> <b>officers</b> aim to gain influence for their efforts to promote regional development? The empirical research is based on data gathered a) through 41 interviews with Finnish actors responsible for the promotion of economic development in city governments, technology centres, regional development agencies, and ministries and other national bodies, and b) through internet survey of <b>development</b> <b>officers</b> at local, regional and national levels (531 respondents, response rate 51. 8 %). The survey was designed to solicit information about power and influence tactics in the context of regional development. The empirical analysis shows, for example, how interpretive power and network power are more important for regional <b>development</b> <b>officers</b> than institutional and resource power, and how indirect influence tactics surpass direct tactics...|$|R
