50|$|Hale {{was born}} Rufus Edward Mackahan in Washington, D.C.. He studied {{to be an}} opera singer and also had success as an inventor.

5000|$|Some {{of their}} number managed to obtain liquid oxygen {{from the nearby}} Arthur D. Little company, which was {{developing}} a portable military [...] "lox" [...] generator and was dumping excess product fuming and freezing everything, into the gutter. The club hauled it to their test site in 5-gallon steel cans insulated with fiber mat. This gave their most successful test—the rocket motor roared with a ten-foot plume of flame filled with standing shock waves, with the thrust gauge off-scale for ten seconds or more. But the aluminum motor burned out its throat and set the test stand on fire, which they put out with a Pyrene <b>hand</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> However the carbon tetrachloride produced phosgene and chlorine gasses (they deduced), which corroded all the metal.|$|E

25|$|Firefighting systems include <b>hand</b> held <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> to {{automatic}} deluge systems. Special <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> {{which do}} not use toxic materials must be used. In {{the event of a}} fire, toxic gases may be released by burning materials, and the occupants will have to use the built-in breathing systems (BIBS) until the chamber gas has been flushed sufficiently. When a system with oxygen partial pressure 0.48 bar is pressurized below about 70 msw (231fsw), the oxygen fraction is too low to support combustion (less than 6%), and the fire risk is low. During the early stages of compression and towards the end of decompression the oxygen levels will support combustion, and greater care must be taken.|$|R
25|$|While she {{was dancing}} at the Hyperion Theater at Yale University, in November 1911, {{students}} rushed the stage. The Yale News had complained about ticket {{prices for the}} production being raised to $2. The performance followed the Yale - Princeton University football game played earlier the same day.

Deslys retreated to her room while stage <b>hands</b> used <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> to subdue the students.

50|$|Data centers feature fire {{protection}} systems, including passive and Active Design elements, {{as well as}} implementation of fire prevention programs in operations. Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a fire at its incipient stage. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual <b>fire</b> suppression using <b>hand</b> held <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> before the <b>fire</b> grows to a large size. An active {{fire protection}} system, such as a fire sprinkler system or a clean agent fire suppression gaseous system, is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. High sensitivity smoke detectors, such as aspirating smoke detectors, activating clean agent fire suppression gaseous systems activate earlier than fire sprinklers.|$|R

5000|$|Aircraft {{factory worker}} Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) {{is accused of}} {{starting}} a fire at the Stewart Aircraft Works in Glendale, California, an act of sabotage that killed his friend Mason (Virgil Summers). Kane believes the real culprit is a man named Fry (Norman Lloyd) who, during their efforts {{to put out the}} <b>fire,</b> <b>handed</b> him a <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher</b> filled with gasoline, which he passed on to Mason.

5000|$|Fire {{protection}} systems, including {{passive and}} active elements, {{as well as}} implementation of fire prevention programmes in operations. Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smouldering components prior {{to the development of}} flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual <b>fire</b> suppression using <b>hand</b> held <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishers</b> before the <b>fire</b> grows to a large size. A fire sprinkler system is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. Clean agent fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of fire walls around the space, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed.|$|R
