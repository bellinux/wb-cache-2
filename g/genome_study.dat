25|$|Results of a <b>genome</b> <b>study</b> {{reported}} in 2014 suggest that tuberculosis is newer than previously thought. Scientists {{were able to}} recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found {{it was less than}} 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the mode of transmission from Africa to South America. The team from University of Tubingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago. Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when coming up on African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years. This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists. However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field, for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.|$|E

50|$|The European {{honey bee}} {{is the third}} insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, to have its genome mapped. According to {{scientists}} who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations. Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito. The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects. Another significant finding from the honey bee <b>genome</b> <b>study</b> was that honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system because functional key enzymes (DNA methyl-transferase 1 and 3) were identified in the genome. DNA methylation {{is one of the}} important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on the DNA. DNA methylation later was identified {{to play an important role}} in gene regulation and gene alternative splicing. The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (inactive remains have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly species.|$|E

40|$|Silver-Russell {{syndrome}} (SRS) {{is characterized}} by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation in association with a typical small triangular face and other variable features. Genetic and epigenetic disturbances are detected in about 50 % of the patients. Most frequently, SRS is caused by altered gene expression on chromosome 11 p 15 due to hypomethylation of the telomeric imprinting center (ICR 1) that is present in at least 40 % of the patients. Maternally inherited duplications encompassing ICR 1 and ICR 2 domains at 11 p 15 were found in a few patients, and a microduplication restricted to ICR 2 was described in a single SRS child. We report on a microduplication of the ICR 2 domain encompassing the KCNQ 1, KCNQ 1 OT 1, and CDKN 1 C genes in a three-generation family: there were four instances of paternal transmissions of the microduplication from a single male uniformly resulting in normal offspring, and five maternal transmissions, via two clinically normal sisters, with all the children exhibiting SRS. This report provides confirmatory evidence that a microduplication restricted to the ICR 2 domain results in SRS when maternally transmitted. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} a whole genome scan on {{a sample of}} 630 Caucasian subjects from 53 human pedigrees. Several genomic regions were suggested {{to be linked to}} height. In an attempt to confirm the identified genomic regions, as well as to identify new genomic regions linked to height, we conducted a whole genome linkage study on an extended sample of 1, 816 subjects from 79 pedigrees, which includes the 53 pedigrees containing the original 630 subjects from our previous whole <b>genome</b> <b>study</b> and an additional 128 new subjects, and 26 further pedigrees containing 1, 058 subjects. Several regions achieved suggestive linkage signals, such as 9 q 22. 32 [MLS (multipoint LOD score) = 2. 74], 9 q 34. 3 [MLS = 2. 66], Xq 24 [two-point LOD score = 2. 64 at the marker DXS 8067], and 7 p 14. 2 [MLS = 2. 051. The importance of the above regions is supported either by other whole genome studies or by candidate genes within these regions relevant to linear growth or pathogenesis of short stature. In addition, this study has tentatively confirmed the Xq 24 region's linkage to height, as this region was also detected in the previous whole <b>genome</b> <b>study.</b> To date, our study has achieved the largest sample size in the field of genetic linkage studies of human height.
