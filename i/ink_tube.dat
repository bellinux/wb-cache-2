50|$|Eumenichthys is one {{of three}} lampriform genera known to possess ink tubes, {{allowing}} them to expel a black fluid from their cloacae as a defense against predators. The <b>ink</b> <b>tube</b> is derived from a primitive gut and runs above and parallel to the intestine. A known predator of the unicorn crestfish is the longnose lancetfish, (Alepisaurus ferox); a lancetfish 73 cm (29 in) long has been found that had swallowed a unicorn crestfish 55 cm (22 in) long.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps the easiest, most {{trouble-free}} {{method of}} refilling ink cartridges {{is through the}} use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the <b>ink</b> delivery <b>tubes,</b> a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.|$|R

5000|$|In 1887, {{he opened}} a factory that {{produced}} intaglio <b>ink</b> and paint <b>tubes.</b> In 1890, the company went public as an aktieselskab called the [...] "Danske Bogtrykkeres Farvefabrik", but he continued as General Manager. In 1896, he presented the first moving pictures in Denmark in a wooden structure called the [...] "Panorama" [...] at the square in front of Copenhagen's city hall. His building and equipment were lost to a suspicious fire, but he soon re-established his shows (renamed the [...] "Kineoptikon") at his Panoptikon. His activities made him a wealthy man, but also ensured that his output as a painter was rather small. Just {{before his death in}} 1912, he and his second wife, Oline, created the [...] "Vilhelm Pachts Kunstnerboligs Legat" [...] (Artist-Dwelling Legacy), which turned his mansion, [...] "Pachts Bo", into housing for indigent artists.|$|R
5000|$|Each Henry {{drawing machine}} was based around an {{analogue}} bombsight computer {{in combination with}} other components which Henry happened to have acquired for his home-based workshop in Whalley Range, Manchester. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Each machine took up to six weeks to construct and each drawing from between two hours to two days to complete. The drawing machines relied upon an external electric power source to operate either one or two servo motors which powered the synchronisation of suspended drawing implement(s) acting upon either a stationary or moving drawing table. (O'Hanrahan 2005) With the first drawing machine Henry employed biros as the mark-making implement; however with the machines that followed he preferred to use Indian <b>ink</b> in technical <b>tube</b> pens, since these effects, in contrast to biro ink, do not risk fading upon prolonged exposure to sunlight.
