40|$|The sera of {{patients}} with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) contain autoantibodies which react with antigens present {{in a variety of}} mammalian squamous epithelia. The biologic role of these epithelial antigens is unknown; however, they do appear to be markers of epithelial differentiation. We have examined many human tissues that may be used as sources of large amounts of BP and PV antigens, including the human amnion, which is composed <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> reflectum and placentum (epithelial monolayers) and amnion cord (stratified epithelium). Human amnion was obtained from normal term deliveries and specimens of each area <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> were processed for light and electron microscopy. Samples <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 4 -μm sections were used as a substrate for BP and PV antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) techniques. Well-characterized BP serum (indirect IF titer 1 : 2560), PV serum (indirect IF titer 1 : 160), and normal human serum (negative indirect IF) were utilized as sources of BP and PV autoantibodies and a negative control, respectively. Linear staining of the BMZ was produced by BP antibodies in 8 / 8 specimens <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> reflectum, 8 / 8 specimens <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> placentum, and 3 / 3 specimens <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> cord. Staining <b>of</b> the epithelial intercellular spaces was produced by PV antibodies of 2 / 3 specimens <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> cord and none <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> reflectum (0 / 8) or amnion placentum (0 / 8) tested. Normal human serum produced no specific staining <b>of</b> the <b>amnion.</b> The light and the ultrastructural features <b>of</b> human <b>amnion</b> basement membrane zone and intercellular spaces resembles closely their epidermal counterparts. The restricted distribution of BP antigen in amnion epithelial basal cells (amnion reflectum, placentum, and cord) and PV antigen in stratified amnion epithelium (amnion cord) reinforces their relationship with epithelial differentiation...|$|R

One of these characteristics is antibacterial property, which can be important in protection against infections after burn and surgery. This study was designed aiming at investigating the antibacterial effect <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> on the growth of different bacterial strains and comparing this effect in epithelial and mesenchymal sides <b>of</b> the <b>amnion.</b> Methods: In this study, the antibacterial effect of amniotic membrane was evaluated on three standard bacterial strains Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and two clinical isolated strain of E. coli (E. coli T 3 and E. coli T 4), and their susceptibility was measured. A modified disk diffusion {{test was used to}} assess the antibacterial effect. In this method, amnion was placed on the cultured agar surface as an antibiotic releasing disk. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Tukey's tests. Results: The vicinity <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> membrane caused inhibition zone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and two clinical isolated strains of E. coli. Formation of Inhibition zone in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and two clinical isolated strains of E. coli had no relationship with the epithelial or mesenchymal side of amniotic membrane.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{detailed}} knowledge obtained {{over the last}} decade on the molecular regulation of gastrulation in amniotes, the process <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> development has been poorly described and illustrated in mice, and conflicting descriptions exist. Understanding the morphogenesis and development not only of the early mouse embryo, but also of its extraembryonic tissues, is crucial for correctly interpreting fate-mapping data and mouse mutants with gastrulation defects. Moreover, the recent isolation from <b>amnion</b> <b>of</b> cells with stem cell features further argues for {{a better understanding of the}} process <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> formation. Here, we revisit the highly dynamic process <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> formation in the mouse. Amnion development starts early during gastrulation and is intimately related to the formation of the exocoelom and the expansion of the amniotic fold. The authoritative description involves the fusion of two amniotic folds, a big posterior and a smaller anterior fold. We challenged this 'two amniotic folds' model by performing detailed histomorphological analyses of dissected, staged embryos and 3 D reconstructions using historical sections. Results A posterior fold of extraembryonic ectoderm and associated epiblast is formed early during gastrulation by accumulation of extraembryonic mesoderm posterior to the primitive streak. Previously called the "posterior amniotic fold", we rename it the "amniochorionic fold" (ACF) because it forms both amnion and chorion. Exocoelom formation within the ACF seems not to involve apoptosis within the mesoderm. The ACF and exocoelom expand without disrupting the anterior junction of epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm. No separate anterior fold is formed; its absence was confirmed in 3 D reconstructions. Amnion and chorion closure is eccentric, close to the anterior margin of the egg cylinder: we name it the "anterior separation point". Conclusions Here, we reconcile previous descriptions <b>of</b> <b>amnion</b> formation and provide new nomenclature, as well as an animation, that clarify and emphasize the arrangement of the tissues that contribute to amnion development and the dynamics of the process. According to our data, the amnion and the chorion are formed by a single amniochorionic fold initiated posteriorly. Finally, we give an overview on mutant mouse models with impaired amnion development. </p...|$|R

40|$|The oxytocin/oxytocin {{receptor}} (OXT/OXTR) system {{plays an}} important role in the regulation <b>of</b> parturition. The <b>amnion</b> is a major source of prostaglandins and inflammatory cytokine synthesis, which increase both before and during labor. Amnion is a noncontractile tissue; therefore, the role played by OXT/OXTR in this tissue will be fundamentally different from the role played in myometrial contractions. In the present study, we demonstrate increased OXTR mRNA and protein concentrations in human amnion epithelial cells associated with the onset of labor. We show that incubation <b>of</b> primary human <b>amnion</b> epithelial cells with IL 1 B results in a rapid, transient up-regulation of OXTR mRNA expression, which peaks in prelabor samples after 6 h. Incubation <b>of</b> prelabor <b>amnion</b> epithelial cells with OXT results in a marked increase of prostaglandin E(2) synthesis, and we demonstrate that OXT activates the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signal transduction pathway to stimulate up-regulation of cyclo-oxygenase 2 in human amnion epithelial cells. The increased ability <b>of</b> human <b>amnion</b> to produce prostaglandins in response to OXT treatment suggests a complementary role for the OXT/OXTR system in the activation <b>of</b> human <b>amnion</b> and the onset of labor...|$|R

Polymorphonuclear neutrophil suspensions were placed on one surface <b>of</b> the <b>amnion,</b> and either the chemotactic peptide FMLP or the cell membrane activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was placed on the opposite side <b>of</b> the <b>amnion.</b> Stroma and basement membrane sides <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> were separately exposed to the PMN. The PMN suspension was removed and centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for superoxide anion (O 2 -.) and for elastase activity. Injury to the acellular amnion was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and by measurement of fibronectin (FN) released from the membrane matrix. Although both stimulants cause a concentration-dependent release of O 2 -., only PMA stimulated elastase release. These effects were similar when either the stroma or the basement membrane side was exposed to PMN. PMA-stimulated cells and supernatants from PMA-stimulated cells caused solubilization of membrane at different incubation times. Electron microscopy confirmed the disruption of the basement membrane <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> by PMA-stimulated PMN. Oxidant scavengers (SOD and catalase) did not prevent matrix degradation, and elastase inhibition by a specific chloromethylketone inhibitor diminished FN release on both sides <b>of</b> the <b>amnion</b> by activated PMN supernatants, but only on the basement membrane side by intact PMN.
