5|$|In a liberalised energy market, investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face {{the full cost}} of their decisions. But this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E
5|$|Nonmetals do {{not have}} any {{universal}} or near-universal applications. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with metals, most of which have structural uses; nor the metalloids, the typical uses of which extend to (for example) oxide glasses, alloying components, and semiconductors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.|$|E

5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{believe that}} the euro is under attack so that countries, such as the UK and the US, can continue to fund their large external deficits and government deficits, and to avoid {{the collapse of the}} US$. The US and UK do not have large domestic savings pools to draw on and therefore are dependent on external savings e.g. from China. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the eurozone, which is self-funding.|$|E
5|$|Some sources erroneously {{state that}} the XTSF-1 became the XTB2F, however this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The XTSF-1 was the only {{aircraft}} ever designated by the U.S. Navy in the 'TS for Torpedo Scout' category, the designation being superseded and incorporated, along with 'BT for Bomber-Torpedo', 'SB for Scout-Bomber' and 'TB for Torpedo-Bomber', into the new 'A for Attack' series.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} where this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> {{and it is}} desirable to make {{the width of the}} transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and {{have been described as}} resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1985, a group {{including}} astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner {{published a}} series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were forged. Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig {{and others at the}} Natural History Museum in London. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, but that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Europe {{the tree}} of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found {{the tree of}} heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman.

Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but {{there is no evidence that}} populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
