5|$|Breaking Benjamin {{began working}} on a fourth album, titled <b>Dear</b> Agony, in 2009. It was the first album Burnley wrote while {{completely}} sober. In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and phosphenes following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain sober. Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within <b>Dear</b> Agony due to his sobriety. The album cover features Burnley's brain scan, representing the recurrent themes on <b>Dear</b> Agony related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.|$|E

5|$|Stevens, Bilson and De Meo {{began to}} {{consider}} making The Rocketeer as a low-budget film, shot in black-and-white {{and funded by}} independent investors. Their plan {{was to make the}} film a complete homage to the Commando Cody serial films, and use a cast largely associated with character actors. However, that same year, the trio approached William <b>Dear</b> to direct/co-write The Rocketeer, and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea. Bilson, De Meo, and <b>Dear</b> kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin. They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons to Bettie Page (Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to Jenny and her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more family friendly). <b>Dear</b> proceeded to transform the climax from a submarine into a Zeppelin setpiece.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick <b>Dear,</b> who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, <b>Dear</b> and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E

5000|$|The NCIS team regroup in the {{aftermath}} of the Navy Yard bombing. Gibbs, Abby, Palmer, and Vance escape the explosion unscathed, while Ducky and McGee are hospitalized. Ziva and Tony remain unaccounted for, trapped in an elevator, though they are able to escape. The FBI is called in to aid in the hunt for Harper <b>Dearing,</b> only for <b>Dearing</b> to set a trap that kills four FBI agents. The President authorises the use of [...] "extreme prejudice" [...] to bring <b>Dearing</b> to justice, but the trail runs cold when <b>Dearing</b> seemingly kills himself to avoid capture. Gibbs is unconvinced, and puts pressure on Dearing's sister-in-law to reveal his location. NCIS raid Dearing's home, only to find that he has once again eluded them. Gibbs convinces Vance that the only way to approach <b>Dearing</b> is to approach him alone; Vance agrees and Gibbs is finally able to confront <b>Dearing,</b> who compares himself with Gibbs and the pain of unjustly losing a child. Gibbs stabs and kills <b>Dearing</b> in self-defense before <b>Dearing</b> can shoot him, as the latter man planned to do, ending Dearing's threat permanently, and the episode ends two months later with Gibbs passing by a memorial to the victims of the bombing.|$|R
