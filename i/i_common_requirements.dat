40|$|Web applications, or web sites, are an {{important}} communication medium conveying information between organizations and the users of their web applications. To ensure a unique appearance of their web applications, organizations define standardized content, navigation and presentation requirements for web applications within their corporate identity. However, specialized information supplied by organizational units may not fit into this standardized scheme. To overcome this situation, we introduce the concept of web site families, capable of capturing the requirements necessary to fulfill the corporate identity, {{while at the same}} time providing the flexibility to specify distinct requirements of organizational units. Web site families rely on a hierarchical model in which <b>common</b> <b>requirements</b> for a family of web sites are captured. Those requirements may be extended, refined or re-structured within a concrete web site of an organizational unit as long as it adheres to the <b>common</b> <b>requirements.</b> In this paper we will define the structure of web site families and how consistency criteria derived from the <b>common</b> <b>requirements</b> of organizations allow the flexible definition of families of web sites...|$|R

40|$|METALex {{provides}} a generic and easily extensible {{framework for the}} XML encoding of the structure and contents of any type of regulation. This paper discusses some design decisions related to timekeeping and versions. Version management guidelines for legislation are typically codified in legislation or considered part of customary law. This obviously makes them jurisdiction-specific, although there are <b>common</b> <b>requirements.</b> Our {{point of view is}} that we try to find <b>common</b> <b>requirements</b> by looking at the functions of specific timestamping and versioning practices. If we cannot properly support a certain kind of function we do not try to provide XML facilities for that function, but leave the issue open for other extensions to the schema. ...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{web pages}} require a layout with {{multiple}} (often three) columns, {{with the main}} page content in one column (often the center), and supplementary content such as menus and advertisements in the other columns (sidebars). These columns commonly require separate backgrounds, with borders between them, and should {{appear to be the}} same height no matter which column has the tallest content. A <b>common</b> <b>requirement</b> is that the sidebars have a fixed width, with the center column adjusting in size to fill the window (fluid or liquid layout). Another <b>common</b> <b>requirement</b> is that, when a page does not contain enough content to fill the screen, the footer should drop {{to the bottom of the}} browser window instead of leaving blank space underneath.|$|R
