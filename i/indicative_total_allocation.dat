40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} calculus {{of variations}} is extended in such a fashion as to account for Lagrangian functions that contain {{a finite number of}} functionals as arguments. These results are applied to two classes of problems in which the cost per unit time depends on the <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> over a fixed interval, and the <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> is linear functional of the process. All appropriate initial data and the <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> are determined for problems in which the cost functional is to be stationarized such that the process starts and ends at specified times with specified values. The first class of problems considers only the simple stationarization. The second class of problems adjoins a law of evolution and control to the problems of the first class and seeks the stationarizing allocation in addition to the information required in the first class of problems. The effects of nonlinearity are pointed out, and it is shown that a singularity of the algebraic problem associated with the boundary conditions always results in a unique solution while the nonsingular case admits both the possibility of no solutions or of many solutions...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{contemporary}} systems contain multiple applications, some {{which have}} firm real-time requirements while others do not. These applications are deployed on multi-core platforms with shared resources, such as processors, interconnect, and memories. However, resource sharing causes contention between sharing applications {{that must be}} resolved by a resource arbiter. Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a commonly used arbiter, but {{it is challenging to}} configure such that the bandwidth and latency requirements of the real-time resource clients are satisfied, while minimizing their <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> to improve the performance of non-real-time clients. This work addresses this problem by presenting an efficient TDM configuration methodology. The five main contributions are: 1) An analysis to derive a bandwidth and latency guarantee for a TDM schedule with arbitrary slot assignment, 2) A formulation of the TDM configuration problem and a proof that it is NP-hard, 3) An integer-linear programming model that optimally solves the configuration problem by exhaustively evaluating all possible TDM schedule sizes, 4) A heuristic method to choose candidate schedule sizes that substantially reduces computation time with only a slight decrease in efficiency, 5) An experimental evaluation of the methodology that examines its scalability and quantifies the trade-off between computation time and <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> for the optimal and the heuristic algorithms. The approach is also demonstrated on a case study of a HD video and graphics processing system, where a memory controller is shared by a number of processing elements...|$|R

Each player has to pay for each unit of demand a cost that is a nondecreasing and convex function of the <b>total</b> <b>allocation</b> of that resource. This general model of resource allocation generalizes both singleton congestion games with integer-splittable demands and matroid congestion games with player-specific costs.
