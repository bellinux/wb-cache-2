50|$|The <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> was not {{a staple}} {{component}} in original design of automobile pedals. Cars such as the original Ford Model T, 1908, did not have dead pedals and had an upright pedal system. The <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> was developed to prevent the accidental actuation of the clutch or brake, also known as left-foot braking, by providing an alternative surface to rest the foot on. The <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> became more important with time as stronger and faster cars were developed because the left foot must push against the floor to brace the drivers body. Racing cars and civilian cars with manual transmission systems will have the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal.</b> Most auto transmission cars can also have the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> but cars like the Ford Focus 1998 don't have it.|$|E
50|$|In an automobile, the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal,</b> often {{also called}} the foot rest, is {{typically}} a non-moving piece of rubber or metal that the driver is supposed to rest his or her left foot on when driving. Although the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> serves no function in the car, many cars opt to implement it because it provides a number of benefits to the driver. In manual transmission cars the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> is designed to promote a smoother actuation of the clutch by keeping the drivers foot in the same plane as the pedal. Automatic transmission cars can also benefit from the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> because it prevents fatigue by offering a stable inclined surface on which the driver can place his or her foot. Even if a car {{does not have a}} <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> installed, {{there are a variety of}} aftermarket accessories that can be installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} and widely available, these <b>dead</b> <b>pedals</b> {{come in the form}} of foot rests that are put on the car floor. They come in many forms: some are metal plates, some are rubber pads, and some are simply a raised area of the car floor.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> {{provides}} an inclined surface {{for the driver}} to place his foot on while driving. This allows the driver to brace himself or herself when maneuvering without accidentally engaging the brakes. This helps the driver maintain more control over his or her vehicle. [...] It also prevents wear on the brake or clutch pedal because even if no additional pressure is put on these pedals, the constant contact and abrasion of the driver's foot will wear away at the surface of pedals. In automatic cars the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> is normally just a rubber step placed {{on the floor of}} the car. In racing cars the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> is used to cut down the response time in activating the clutch and is integral to smooth actuation of the clutch. It is typically an actual pedal located to left of the clutch. The <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> allows for the racer or driver to keep his left foot on the same plane as the clutch, thus making the transition between them smoother and faster. However, the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> still serves no function to the car itself. There have been attempts to advance the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> technology by making it modular [...] and by making it serve a function as an engine regulator.|$|E

50|$|Dead pedals {{have never}} been a {{required}} addition to standard automobile pedal sets. This is because the advantages of having a <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> are most commonly associated with manual transmission cars. Furthermore, cars with left side drive often have a natural footrest because of the wheel well so it is more common to find right side drive cars with dead pedals. However, the <b>dead</b> <b>pedal</b> promotes safe driving habits by serving as a place for drivers to place their foot and prevent accidental left foot braking. It is not recommended to brake with the left foot because it is less confusing when switching between automatic and manual transmission cars. Resting one's foot on the brake pedal may also accidentally light up the brake lights when the vehicle is not decelerating.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal {{instead of on the}} floorboard or <b>dead</b> <b>pedal.</b> Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|E

50|$|The {{opening act}} for {{this series of}} concerts, and for many other shows of that era, was the New Riders of the Purple Sage. At that time the lineup of the New Riders {{featured}} Jerry Garcia of the Grateful <b>Dead</b> playing <b>pedal</b> steel guitar. The band also included John Dawson, David Nelson, Dave Torbert, and Spencer Dryden. Songs that they recorded at the February 21 and February 23, 1971 shows at the Capitol Theatre were released as an album called Vintage NRPS.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover lifeboats of up to 15 tonnes in weight. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2.44 m of calm water. The 3208 V8 Caterpillar diesel engine will generate power simultaneously for drive and for winching during its launch and recovery procedure. Control of the vehicle is achieved using a single joystick controller which controls the hydraulic transmission functions and has the added safety feature of a <b>dead</b> man <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{the train}} has {{stopped and the}} {{passengers}} are off, another shootout ensues. George boards the train a fourth time, with Grover, as Devereau climbs onto the locomotive and orders the engineer to start moving. An agent shoots Whiney, George shoots Johnson, and Devereau shoots the engineer and places a toolbox on the <b>dead</b> man's brake <b>pedal.</b> Devereau is then shot by Donaldson, falls, and is hit by an oncoming train.|$|R

Also during this tour, E1 Records band Dirge Within {{released}} Force Fed Lies, their debut album 09/01/2009, which contains a guest guitar solo from Virus on the song [...] "Complacency".|$|R
50|$|Each power car {{was fitted}} with a driver's {{compartment}} to enable the train to be controlled from either end. The driving controls were electric; brake controls were electro-pneumatic and enabled coupled multiple units {{to be controlled by}} one driver. A safety device {{in the form of a}} <b>dead</b> man's foot <b>pedal</b> was also fitted in the driver's cabin. A guard's compartment was located adjacent to the driver's compartment in the end of the power cars.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the line}} closed, the Waterfront Red Cars {{comprised}} three tram {{cars in the}} style of the originals. Two of the three Red Cars—the replica cars, numbers 500 and 501 — were built from scratch by employees of the port of Los Angeles; the interiors are cooled using the same clerestory-style windows as the original 500-class Red Cars (“The Fives”). The third car, No. #1058, was a vintage Pacific Electric 950-class car, having been assembled from two wrecked 950-class cars by Richard J. Fellows, restored for parades, movies, and the like, and then cleverly converted to be steered with the original throttle as a tiller and braked by the original brake handle; the original <b>dead</b> man <b>pedal</b> operated the gasoline engine throttle, which powered the rubber tires. The Port of Los Angeles bought the car and converted it back for rail operation as a charter service.|$|R
5000|$|Trials {{bikes are}} often {{designed}} {{without regard for}} attaching a seat. Competition riding {{does not require the}} rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often {{to such a degree that}} at top <b>dead</b> centre, the <b>pedals</b> are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket (BB). In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles. BB rise is one of the significant dimensions used in describing a trials frame with rises between 30 and 75 mm being common in 26" [...] frames. Many competition style 24" [...] frames aim to place the BB at the same height relative to the ground as a 26" [...] frame and so have a BB rise 25 mm (1") more than a similar feeling 26" [...] frame. Street riding biased 24 and 26" [...] frames tend to have lower BB's than competition frames.|$|R
5000|$|The MXR Distortion + ("Distortion Plus") is a {{distortion}} pedal {{originally designed}} in the 1970s by MXR Innovations. As its name implies [...] "distortion," [...] it's a 'distortion' (parallel clipping) but has a rather mild sound. It has been cloned many times, most famously by the DOD 250 Overdrive (a distortion). The pedal uses a single op-amp {{and a pair of}} germanium diodes to ground (parallel-push) for clipping in a very simple configuration with only Output and Distortion controls, no tone control; the pedal uses no discrete transistors. Turning up the Distortion control increases the amount of distortion {{and at the same time}} cuts some bass from the signal. This pedal is perhaps best known for its crunchy heavy metal sound that was featured by Randy Rhoads in his work with Ozzy Osbourne. Jerry Garcia of the Grateful <b>Dead</b> used this <b>pedal</b> exclusively for distortion in the late 1970s. Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü also used the Distortion + as part of his trademark guitar sound. Dave Murray of Iron Maiden has used Distortion + since the early 1980s. Thom Yorke of Radiohead has included the + for many of his signature distortion sounds, using a variety of guitars to achieve various tonal options.|$|R
