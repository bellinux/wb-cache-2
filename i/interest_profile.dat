Extending previous research, the results of Holland’s RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional) scale scores are compared with results from a reductionist approach using individual <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> (including the parameters level, differentiation, and orientation). Both analyses find significant relations between interests and mathematical literacy. The scale score analyses reveal positive associations of Realistic interests with mathematical literacy, whereas Artistic interests show a negative association. <b>Interest</b> <b>profiles</b> from a dimensional representation show individuals with interest orientations close to the Realistic domain score highest on mathematical literacy, with those with interests in both Artistic and Social domains scoring lowest. Results from profile analyses suggest that interest differentiation moderates the interest–ability relation. Only inter-est profiles are predictive for mathematical literacy over and above covariates, indicating that <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> are more robust predictors than the scale scores. Analyses show that <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> are a valid reduction of the scale score models...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of tourists strongly {{depends on the}} availability and quality of information. Little information {{as well as a}} flood can be disorienting and forces many tourists to join the majority visiting major sights. This causes a few crowded places in contrast to many under-utilized. A Destination Management Organization (DMO) has the goal to spread the tourists more evenly, whereas the tourists would like to enjoy the destination to its full potential according to their personal interests. The target of the Dynamic Tour Guide (DTG) is supporting both goals by means of pervasive computing based on the actual context which is defined by personal interests, location and schedule of a tourist. It enables a personalized, spontaneous and guided tour. A field trial was conducted in the summer of 2005 to study the following questions as a precondition for the development: (1) Is it possible to seed generic <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> in the mobile context that allow the accurate prediction of actual rankings? (2) Are the <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> sufficiently diverse to base personalized tours on individual <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> instead of <b>interest</b> prototypes? (3) How do personalized tours affect the spatial {{behavior of}} tourist? Three methods to elicit the generic preferences of tourist in the mobile context are compared with actual rankings using Spearman's rank order coefficient.

Listing is good {{but it does}} not possess interests at different abstraction levels - the higher-level interests are more general, while the lower-level ones are more specific. Furthermore, more general interests, in some sense, correspond to longer-term interests, while more specific interests correspond to shorter-term interests. This hierarchical user <b>interest</b> <b>profile</b> has obvious advantages: specifying user's specific interests and general interests and representing their relationships. Current user <b>interest</b> <b>profile</b> structures mostly do not use implicit method, nor use an appropriate clustering algorithm especially for conceptually hierarchical structures. This research studies building a hierarchical user <b>interest</b> <b>profile</b> (HUIP) and the hierarchical divisive algorithm (HDC). Several users visit hundreds of web pages and each page is recorded in each users profile. These web pages are used to calculate HUIP for each user.

40|$|User {{interest}} profiling {{is important}} for personalized web search, recommendation and retrieval systems. In order to develop a good personalized application one needs to have accurate representation of user profiles. Most of the personalized systems generate interest profiles from user declarations or inferred from cookies or visited web pages. But to achieve a certain result that satisfies the user needs, explicit definition of the user interests is needed. In this paper we propose to obtain interest profiles from a quiz game played by the user where at each play he/she is asked 10 questions from different categories with different difficulty levels. The developed quiz game is integrated to Facebook online social network. By doing so, we {{had the chance to}} extract each user’s both explicit Facebook interest profiles and implicit interest profiles from quiz game answers. These profiles are used to extract different features for each user.

Inferring user interests plays a significant role in providing personalized recommendations on microblogging services, and third-party applications providing social logins via these services, especially in cold-start situations. In this survey, we review user modeling strategies with respect to inferring user interests in previous studies. To this end, we focus on four dimensions of inferring user interest profiles: (1) data collection, (2) representation of user <b>interest</b> <b>profiles,</b> (3) construction and enhancement of user <b>interest</b> <b>profiles,</b> and (4) the evaluation of the constructed profiles. Through this survey, we aim to provide an overview of state-of-the-art user modeling strategies for inferring user <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> on microblogging social networks with respect to the four dimensions.

To support document triage, we have developed an extensible multi-application architecture that initially includes an information workspace and a document reader. An <b>Interest</b> <b>Profile</b> Manager infers users ' interests from their interactions with the triage applications, coupled with {{the characteristics of the}} documents they are interacting with.

Profile similarity across U.

Obtained results suggest that profile shape varies systematically by gender and employment status, with the Euclidean distance measure being more effective than Q correlations for representing these differences and Q correlation {{more effective than the}} C-index.

40|$|Existing social-aware routing {{protocols}} for packet switched networks {{make use of}} the information about the social structure of the network deduced by state information of nodes (e. g., history of past encounters) to optimize routing. Although these approaches are shown to have superior performance to social-oblivious, stateless {{routing protocols}} (BinarySW, Epidemic), the improvement comes at the cost of considerable storage overhead required on the nodes. In this paper we present SANE, the first routing mechanism that combines the advantages of both social-aware and stateless approaches. SANE is based on the observation - that we validate on a real-world trace - that individuals with similar interests tend to meet more often. In SANE, individuals (network members) are characterized by their <b>interest</b> <b>profile,</b> a compact representation of their interests. By implementing a simple routing rule based on <b>interest</b> <b>profile</b> similarity, SANE is free of network state information, thus overcoming the storage capacity problem with existing social-aware approaches. Through thorough experiments, we show the superiority of SANE over existing approaches, both stateful, social-aware and stateless, social-oblivious. We discuss the statelessness of our approach in the supplementary file, which {{can be found on the}} Computer Society Digital Library at [URL] of this manuscript.

At the same time, the capabilities of mobile devices such as smart phones has considerably increased, opening up new ways to communicate and share content. In particular it is becoming feasible that mobile devices can directly share content such as micro-blogs without Internet infrastructure. This offers advantages in terms of scalability, and for micro-blogs in particular, it offers the potential to provide content relevant to the end user without explicit subscriptions. To facilitate this, we propose a totally decentralised push-based scheme for intelligent micro-blogging from mobile devices based on opportunistic networking. This is achieved through mobile devices building <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> relevant to communities induced by frequent social interactions. These <b>interest</b> <b>profiles</b> allow the devices to prioritise forwarding the micro-blog payloads that maximise the utility received by others.

While social-aware {{routing protocols}} {{have been shown to}} have superior performance to social-oblivious, stateless routing protocols such as, e. g., BinarySW, the improvement comes at the cost of considerable storage overhead required on the nodes, which is instead not required for stateless approaches.
