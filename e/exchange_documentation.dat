An example of this collection of information is data associated with an arrest. The data to be exchanged includes not only descriptive and personal identification data regarding the individual arrested (i.e., the person component described above) but also information about the person's alleged offense, the location of the offense, the arresting officer, etc. The IEP represents a set of data that is actually transmitted between agencies for a specific business purpose (e.g., initiating a charging document by the local prosecutor). It includes the actual XML instance that delivers the payload or information. Additional information regarding this specific exchange can be further documented {{in the form of an}} information <b>exchange</b> package <b>documentation</b> (IEPD), which also contains data describing the structure, content, and other artifacts of the information exchange. An IEPD supports a specific set of business requirements in an operational setting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} about tool support for knowledge-intensive {{engineering}} tasks. In particular, it introduces soft-ware technology {{to assist the}} design of complex technical systems. There is a long tradition in automated design pro-blem solving {{in the field of}} artificial intelligence, where, especially in the early stages, the search paradigm dictated many approaches. Later, in the so-called modern period, a better problem understanding {{led to the development of}} more adequate problem solving techniques. However, search still constitutes an indispensable part in computer-based design problem solving—albeit many human problem solvers get by without (almost). We tried to learn lessons from this observa-tion, and one is presented in this paper. We introduce design problem solving by functional abstraction which follows the motto: construct a poor solution with little search, which then must be repaired. For the domain of fluidic engineering we have operationalized the paradigm by the combination of several high-level techniques. The red thread of this paper is design automation, but the presented technology does also contribute in the following respects: (a) productivity enhan-cement by relieving experts from auxiliary and routine tasks; (b) formulation, <b>exchange,</b> and <b>documentation</b> of knowledge about design; (c) requirements engineering, feasibility ana-lysis, and validation...|$|R

40|$|Health {{professionals}} {{communicate with}} each other about medication information using different forms of documentation. This article explores knowledge and power relations surrounding medication information <b>exchanged</b> through <b>documentation</b> among nurses, doctors and pharmacists. Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in 2010 in two medical wards of a metropolitan hospital in Australia. Data collection methods included participant observations, field interviews, video-recordings, document retrieval and video reflexive focus groups. A critical discourse analytic framework was used to guide data analysis. The written medication chart was the main means of communicating medication decisions from doctors to nurses as compared to verbal communication. Nurses positioned themselves as auditors of the medication chart and scrutinised medical prescribing to maintain the discourse of patient safety. Pharmacists utilised the discourse of scientific judgement to guide their decision-making on the necessity of verbal communication with nurses and doctors. Targeted interdisciplinary meetings involving nurses, doctors and pharmacists should be organised in ward settings to discuss the importance of having documented medication information conveyed verbally across different disciplines. Health professionals should be encouraged to proactively seek out each other to relay changes in medication regimens and treatment goals...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{maintenance}} of the medical records of patients has become a worldwide problem with the rapid rise in the count of patients. Furthermore, providing them adequate health care keeping their safety in view is turning into a great challenge for physicians. As such, electronic health records (EHRs) were developed to solve these issues by aiding physicians in imparting quality health care to patients as well as maintaining their safety. Nonetheless, rather than increasing their efficiency, EHRs have become a burden for the physicians as they ultimately increase their error rate and reduce output rate affecting patient safety. As health-IT is advancing progressively, new features {{are added to the}} existing EHRs with the aim to support physicians in providing better healthcare. Till date, some of the most advanced features include clinical support decision system (CDSS), computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system, health information <b>exchange</b> (HIE), mobile <b>documentation</b> application, and a system of safety alerts on a dashboard. Proper training to the physicians on judiciously usage of these EHR functions is required to extract maximum benefit.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Business Information)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 Women, being {{important}} stakeholders of the community, are {{lagging behind}} {{in terms of}} economic empowerment. Their opportunity to participate actively in business in the past was hindered by various discriminatory policies that were in place. ICTs have the forte to empower and increase the knowledge base of the women in SMEs through information dissemination. The argument is that women in South Africa and indeed in many other developing countries have not embraced technology in their everyday businesses as much as their male counterparts. This study therefore explores how women in SMEs in the Cape Metropolitan, Western Cape are utilising ICTs to empower themselves to overcome the economic discrimination they have suffered in the past. In order to collect relevant data and obtain deep insights about the utilisation of ICTs by women in SMEs, a qualitative research method was applied enabling respondents to articulate their experiences concerning the use of ICTs in their businesses. Women of all races were selected using the snowball sampling method and were interviewed. The population involved women in SMEs from the five suburbs of Claremont, Rondebosch, Gardens, Pinelands and Mowbray. The findings of the study are that women in SMEs in the Cape Metropole are utilising various ICTs to empower themselves in their businesses. They are <b>exchanging</b> business <b>documentation</b> with other business resulting in marketing of their entities. Women in SMEs are taking advantage of the fast growing social and business networking technologies such Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Twitter, Skype and blogs to promote marketing of their various products and services, gaining mileage in publicity and also managing their expenditures. ICTs enable women to work anytime, anywhere affording them the opportunity {{to take care of their}} families which they could not do while they were employed in the corporate world. Some of the women in SMEs reported that they can now independently negotiate business deals due to increase in their self-esteem and also have access to available information in their areas of expertise...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a tribute to the legacy of Dr Clive Francis, who {{directly}} and indirectly collected > 14 000 accessions across 60 genera of pasture, forage, and crop species and their wild relatives around the Mediterranean basin, Eastern Africa, and Central and South Asia from 1973 to 2005. This was achieved by a collaborative approach that built strong interactions between disparate organisations (ICARDA, VIR, CLIMA, and Australian genebanks) based on germplasm <b>exchange,</b> conservation and <b>documentation,</b> capacity building, and joint collection. These activities greatly strengthened Australian pasture, forage, and crop genebanks, and led to widespread germplasm utilisation that has waned in the last 5 years, reflecting changing priorities among industry funding bodies and research providers. This situation must be reversed, given the pivotal role genetic resource collections must play to broaden the genetic and adaptive base of plant breeding, to meet the challenge of feeding an increasing population in a depleting resource base. Because the use of germplasm subsets that facilitate phenotyping will stimulate wider utilisation of genetic resources, we discuss the application of core collection and germplasm selection through habitat characterisation/filtering in Australian collections. Both are valid entry points into large collections, but the latter has the advantage of enabling both trait discovery and investigation of plant adaptation, and because it is based on a priori hypothesis testing, it increases understanding even when the trait of interest is not identified...|$|R
40|$|Multi-resistant {{pathogens}} are {{a serious}} problem on a considerable scale for the health sector. Patients with infections induced by multi-resistant bacteria cause enormous additional treatment costs of around 20, 500 € per insured. Due to the recently used billing and documentation system {{there is a significant}} shortage of information transparency. The guidelines for hospital hygiene and infection prevention published by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) include a presumption provision, which means that subject to compliance with these guidelines the observance of the current state of medical science is suspected. In case of a derogation, a scientific justification is necessary, which is used e. g. in connection with liability questions. Within the framework of legal reforms in 2011, the legislator aspires a nationwide improvement of hygiene quality in medical institutions and information transparency. Many specific issues about the general reporting obligation of infections with multi-resistant pathogens or about the standardized <b>exchange</b> of infection <b>documentations</b> between medical institution and health authority remain unresolved. Regional, cross-sectoral networks create the base to tackle targeted measures collectively and may develop sustainable and tailored solutions for their region.

40|$|Using digital {{technology}} for cultural heritage documentation {{is a global}} trend in the 21 st century. Many important techniques are currently under development, including 3 D digital imaging, reverse engineering, GIS (Geographic Information Systems) etc. However, no system for overall management or data integration is yet available. Therefore, we urgently need such a system to efficiently manage and interpret data {{for the preservation of}} cultural heritages. This paper presents a digitizing process developed in Taiwan by the authors. To govern and manage cultural property, three phases of property conservation, registration, restoration and management, has been set up along a timeline. In accordance with the laws of cultural property, a structural system has been built for project management, including data classification and data interpretation with self-documenting characteristics. Through repository information and metadata, a system catalogue (also called data dictionary) (Figure 1) was created. The primary objective of the study is to create an integrated technology for an efficient management of databases. Several benefits could be obtained from this structural standard: (1) cultural heritage management documentation can be centralized to minimize the possibility of data re-entry resulting inconsistency, and also to facilitate simultaneous updating of data; (2) since multiple data can be simultaneously retrieved and saved in real time, the incidence of errors can be reduced; (3) this system could be easily tailored to meet the administrative requirements for the standardization of <b>documentation</b> <b>exchanged</b> between cultural properties institutions and various county and city governments...|$|R
40|$|The project {{arises from}} {{the need to develop}} {{improved}} teaching methodologies in field of the mechanics of continuous media. The objective is to offer the student a learning process to acquire the necessary theoretical knowledge, cognitive skills and the responsibility and autonomy to professional development in this area. Traditionally the teaching of the concepts of these subjects was performed through lectures and laboratory practice. During these lessons the students attitude was usually passive, and therefore their effectiveness was poor. The proposed methodology has already been successfully employed in universities like University Bochum, Germany, University the South Australia and aims to improve the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition through use by the student of a virtual laboratory. This laboratory allows to adapt the curricula and learning techniques to the European Higher Education and improve current learning processes in the University School of Public Works Engineers -EUITOP- of the Technical University of Madrid -UPM-, due there are not laboratories in this specialization. The virtual space is created using a software platform built on OpenSim, manages 3 D virtual worlds, and, language LSL -Linden Scripting Language-, which imprints specific powers to objects. The student or user can access this virtual world through their avatar -your character in the virtual world- and can perform practices within the space created for the purpose, at any time, just with computer with internet access and viewfinder. The virtual laboratory has three partitions. The virtual meeting rooms, where the avatar can interact with peers, solve problems and <b>exchange</b> existing <b>documentation</b> in the virtual library. The interactive game room, where the avatar is has to resolve a number of issues in time. And the video room where students can watch instructional videos and receive group lessons.

And to keep the changes until the consolidation of the new culture which the changes (when they are changes and not mere substitutes) necessarily convey. This article deals with some of the theoretical and practical dilemmas which are present in the innovation of the teaching methods in the university. Innovation in teaching has become an institutional demand, subjet to many pressures and no fewer contradictions. That is why {{it is important to be}} aware of the real possibilities and limitations which set the place for innovation and improvement of teaching in the university. In the framework of that analytic purpose, different innovation models in the university are checked according to their content, their modality and their impact level. Finally, the crucial aspect of any innovation attempt is considered, especially in the university: the training of its teaching staff. Several factors influence in a clear and confirmed way in the effectiveness of the current pedagogical training programs for the university teaching staff: the teacher’s mentality (including their pedagogical beliefs and attitudes towards their teaching performance); their time availability (or the density of their agendas); the existence of referents and examples of good teaching practice; their own teaching strategies.

The OA has become in a short time, an alternative option for the publication and dissemination of research results international scientific community. This medium offers many advantages over the traditional system of scientific publication in journals kept by commercial publishers, providing a channel for the publication of research results: faster, because it favors the immediate visibility of publications; cheaper, because it allows universities and research centers have access to more sources, more complete, because it can, not only query results but also the data on which they were based, and transparent, because it allows institutions of a better way to control the results of their research. The OA has generated significant discussion and action nuclei around institutional and financial support to open access publications on the Internet. The concept of "Open Access" not only has to do with accessibility to scientific literature, but also with the idea of ​​eliminating the requirement to transfer the copyright of the published articles, which facilitates greater and more rapid international dissemination.
