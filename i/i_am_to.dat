It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more nearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both thought of me, even at that engrossing time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a part of all their plans, for {{the present and the}} future. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write Richard once a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write to him every alternate day. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> informed, under his own hand, of all his labours and successes; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> observe how resolute and persevering he would be; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ada's bridesmaid when they <b>were</b> married; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> live with them afterwards; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> keep all the keys of their house; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made happy for ever and a day.|$|R

25|$|The {{project was}} delayed to September 11, 2007 and then October 16, 2007 {{but it was}} never released. Problems at her label, Interscope Records, were {{responsible}} for the multiple delays. Due to the delays, the album was often reworked, and multiple times the album was renamed from Here <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>to</b> Flirt and finally to Lip Lock. In an interview with New York Post, it was revealed under the title Here I Am the album had actually been completed; however, both times Interscope shelved the project.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been {{abandoned}} because {{she was going to be}} married..."In short, I no longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> be married..".

25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|Lesser was {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} potential of using television as a teaching tool, but he was eventually named as the advisory board chairman of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization created to oversee the production and research of Sesame Street, and was the show's first educational director. [...] He was also skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first director, but Cooney later stated, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> know the pleasure of his company".|$|E

500|$|In 1967, Lesser {{was asked}} to help develop and lead the {{research}} department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible {{for the production of}} Sesame Street and other educational television programs. [...] He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale. [...] At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, [...] "he took some convincing". [...] As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able to make a real contribution. [...] When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, {{and that it would be}} an [...] "experimental venture in education by television", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. [...] Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> know the pleasure of his company".|$|E

He was contemplating resignation, but Lincoln and Grant requested that he remain in the Army. [...] At the end of the interview, Burnside wrote, [...] "I was not informed of any duty upon which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> be placed."

500|$|Both {{the cast}} and crew {{admitted}} that filming an episode of The X-Files in real time was physically and mentally exhausting. Duchovny later joked that, after filming concluded, he [...] "could win an Emmy for most bruises." [...] Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as [...] "challenging." [...] She said, [...] "I'm realizing how comfortable and connected <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> the rhythm we're used to." [...] Tom Braidwood, who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show, called Davis' role [...] "brutal" [...] and noted that [...] "It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German." [...] Davis later joked that [...] "Maybe we shouldn't try to do two clever things at once. I think it worked fine, but it was a struggle to do it." ...|$|E

The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form.

On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm.

[...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
