25|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} (exhaust tee, exhaust cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects the}} exhaust valve(s) and diverts the <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> to the sides {{so that it does}} not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view. This is not necessary for twin hose regulators as they exhaust air behind the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|Endothermy demands {{frequent}} respiration, {{which can}} result in water loss. In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.|$|E
25|$|Like pseudoscorpions and harvestmen, Solifugae lack book lungs, having {{instead a}} {{well-developed}} tracheal system that inhales and <b>exhales</b> <b>air</b> through {{three pairs of}} slits on the animal's underside.|$|R

50|$|The {{sound of}} the {{lungfish}} <b>exhaling</b> <b>air</b> at the surface prior to inhaling a fresh breath {{has been compared to}} that made by a small bellows. Young lungfish come to the surface to breathe air when they are about 25 mm long.|$|R
25|$|<b>Exhaled</b> <b>air</b> {{is almost}} fully at {{equilibrium}} with water vapor {{at the body}} temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath {{is the basis of}} exhaled breath condensate, an evolving medical diagnostic test.|$|E
25|$|Nasal {{turbinates}} are convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. In most mammals and birds these are present and lined with mucous membranes that perform two functions. They improve {{the sense of}} smell by increasing the area available to absorb airborne chemicals, and they warm and moisten inhaled air, and extract heat and moisture from <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> to prevent desiccation of the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1950s, the {{accepted}} method of resuscitation was the chest-pressure and arm-lift technique that {{was shown to}} be ineffective by Safar and Elam. In 1954, Elam {{was the first to}} demonstrate experimentally that <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> ventilation was a sound technique. Elam and Safar (and later Gordon) performed many experiments demonstrating the superiority of the rescue breathing technique. The problem then became one of popularizing the method.|$|E

5000|$|Sniffing is {{observed}} among all terrestrial vertebrates, wherein they inhale environmental air. [...] Interestingly, though, sniffing may also occur in underwater environments wherein an animal may <b>exhale</b> <b>air</b> from within its lungs and nasal cavity to acquire odors within an aquatic environment and then re-inhale this air. (See sniffing in small animals.) ...|$|R
25|$|A similar effect {{occurs with}} the second stage. Air which has already {{expanded}} and cooled through the first stage expands again and cools further at the demand valve of the second stage. This cools {{the components of the}} second stage and water in contact with them may freeze. Metal components around the moving parts of the valve mechanism allow heat transfer from the surrounding slightly warmer water, and from <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> from the diver, which is considerably warmer than the surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The oldest breath {{analyzer}} models pass breath {{through a}} solution of potassium dichromate, which oxidizes ethanol into acetic acid, changing color in the process. A monochromatic light beam is passed through this sample, and a detector records the change in intensity and, hence, the change in color, {{which is used to}} calculate the percent alcohol in the breath. However, since potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizer, numerous alcohol groups can be oxidized by it, producing false positives. This source of false positives is unlikely as very few other substances found in <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> are oxidizable.|$|E
25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> {{condenses}} on {{the cold}} inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E

Materials and methods. The <b>exhaling</b> <b>air</b> condensate pH meanings (without deaeration and after the argonome deaeration) are analyzed in 55 children with different level of a bronchial asthma control, in a disease dynamics in part of them. Results. The pH meaning differences in patients with different level of a bronchial asthma control are not revealed at investigation of the EAC pH without the argonome deaeration (p= 0. 76 — at assessment of a control level according to the ACQ day scale and p= 0. 48 — at assessment according to week ACQ scale). A progradient decrease of meanings with aggravation of a bronchial asthma control level, assessed according to the ACQ day scale (p= 0. 0001), is established at investigation of the EAC pH after the argonome deaeration...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} and {{development}} of a novel low-cost, non-invasive type sensor suitable for human breath sensing is reported. It {{can be used to}} detect respiratory disorders like bronchial asthma by analyzing the recorded breathing pattern. Though there are devices like spirometer to diagnose asthma, they are very inconvenient for patient's use because patients are made to <b>exhale</b> <b>air</b> through mouth forcefully. Presently developed sensor will overcome this limitation and is helpful in the diagnosis of respiratory related abnormalities. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in cantilever configuration is used as a sensing element to form the breath sensor. Two identical sensors are mounted on a spectacle frame, such that the tidal flow of inhaled and <b>exhale</b> <b>air</b> will impinge on sensor, for sensing the breathing patterns. These patterns are recorded, filtered, analyzed and displayed using CRO. Further the sensor is calibrated using a U-tube water manometer. The added advantage of piezoelectric type sensing element is that it is self powered without the need of any external power source...|$|R
25|$|Practically all early {{respirators}} {{consisted of}} a bag placed completely over the head, fastened around the throat with windows through which the wearer could see. Some were rubber, some were made of rubberized fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, {{but in most cases}} a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of carbon dioxide in <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air.|$|E
25|$|Modern mammals have {{respiratory}} turbinates, convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. These {{are lined with}} mucous membranes that warm and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from <b>exhaled</b> <b>air.</b> An animal with respiratory turbinates can maintain {{a high rate of}} breathing without the danger of drying its lungs out, and therefore may have a fast metabolism. Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E
25|$|In Cousteau's {{original}} aqualung prototype, {{there was}} no exhaust hose, and the <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> exited through a one-way valve at the mouthpiece. It worked out of water, but when he tested the aqualung in the river Marne air ed from the regulator {{before it could be}} breathed when the mouthpiece was above the regulator. After that, he had the second breathing tube fitted. Even with both tubes fitted, raising the mouthpiece above the regulator increases the delivered pressure of gas and lowering the mouthpiece reduces delivered pressure and increases breathing resistance. As a result, many aqualung divers, when they were snorkeling on the surface to save air while reaching the dive site, put the loop of hoses under an arm to avoid the mouthpiece floating up causing free flow.|$|E

25|$|Kirk's dik-diks {{are highly}} adapted to {{surviving}} in the arid regions of eastern Africa. They have a hairy proboscis with tiny slit-like nostrils, {{a feature that}} is most pronounced in the Guenther's dik-dik. This proboscis contains an enlarged nasal chamber that is supplied with a rich amount of blood that is cooled via rapid nasal panting. Panting through their snouts leads to airflow and evaporation that cools the blood before it is pumped back into the body.2 This process is also efficient, because it results in a minimal loss {{of water in the}} <b>exhaled</b> <b>air.</b> Water and energy conserving methods, such as fluctuating body temperatures, lowered metabolic rates, concentrated urine, and dry feces all contribute to the ability of the dik-dik to survive harsh arid climates. Further, as observed by Hoppe 1977b, Kamau 1988, and Maloiy et al., 1988, they also conserve fluids by licking dew from their nose and reabsorbing water from their feces. When compared to cattle, dik-dik have a significantly lower density of sweat glands.|$|E
25|$|These unusual {{regulators}} {{were designed}} by Robert J. Dempster and made at his factory in Illinois, USA, from 1961 to 1965. The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both two-stage regulators. The second-stage looks like the mouthpiece of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside the mouthpiece tube. The <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> goes into a corrugated coaxial exhaust hose which surrounds the intermediate-pressure hose and discharges about 60% of {{the way back to}} the first-stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face. Near the mouthpiece is a one-way valve to let outside water into the exhaust hose to avoid free flow if the diaphragm (at the mouth) is below the open end of the exhaust hose. The Mark I has hoses only on one side, and the Mark II has twinned intermediate-pressure hoses, each with its own coaxial exhaust hose and second stage, one assembly on each side of the diver's head, but with both second stages in the same mouthpiece housing and operated by the same diaphragm. This version has no large visible regulator.|$|E
500|$|Scientists have reconstructed the {{respiratory}} system of Majungasaurus {{based on a}} superbly preserved series of vertebrae (UA 8678) recovered from the Maevarano Formation. Most of these vertebrae {{and some of the}} ribs contained cavities (pneumatic [...] ) that may have resulted from the infiltration of avian-style lungs and air sacs. In birds, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac, the upper back vertebrae by the lung, and the lower back and sacral (hip) vertebrae by the abdominal air sac. Similar features in Majungasaurus vertebrae imply the presence of these air sacs. These air sacs may have allowed for a basic form of avian-style 'flow-through ventilation,' where air flow through the lungs is one-way, so that oxygen-rich air inhaled from outside the body is never mixed with <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> laden with carbon dioxide. This method of respiration, while complicated, is highly efficient.|$|E
50|$|A {{hands-free}} HME enables laryngectomees {{to speak}} without requiring finger occlusion. The device {{consists of a}} combination of HME and an automatic speaking valve, which closes automatically, when <b>exhaling</b> <b>air</b> for speaking, enabling the pulmonary air to be diverted through the voice prosthesis into the esophagus. It reopens automatically, when exhalation decreases. Beside that the hands-free HME enables easy removal in case of coughing, or even an adjustable cough relief valve, to release the air that is built up during coughing. In some devices, speech membranes in different strengths can accommodate different speaking pressures.|$|R
50|$|CPR {{involves}} chest compressions {{for adults}} between 5 cm and 6 cm deep {{and at a}} rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either <b>exhaling</b> <b>air</b> into the subject's mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers. In children, however, only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes.|$|R

2500|$|For a {{few years}} in the mid-1950s, Draeger made the Draeger Delfin II (their first scuba {{regulator}} - it was marketed as the Barakuda (now IAC) in the USA): this was a single stage single hose [...] "pendulum"" [...] regulator with only one ambient pressure (corrugated) hose: the <b>exhaled</b> <b>air</b> went back down the hose to the cylinder mounted regulator and was released to outside through a one-way valve inside the casing.

50|$|The one-way endobronchial valve is {{typically}} implanted such {{that when a}} patient <b>exhales,</b> <b>air</b> is able to flow through the valve {{and out of the}} lung compartment that is fed by that airway, but when the patient inhales, the valve closes and blocks air from entering that lung compartment. Thus, an implanted endobronchial valve typically helps a lung compartment to empty itself of air. This {{has been shown to be}} beneficial in the treatment of emphysema, where lungs lose their elasticity and thus cannot contract sufficiently to <b>exhale</b> <b>air,</b> leading to air trapping and hyperaeration. When one or more diseased portions of an emphysematous lung are made to deflate and collapse, other healthier portions of the lung have more room in the chest cavity to inhale and exhale, pressure is removed from the diaphragm, and even the heart may function better as the hyper-inflated lung becomes smaller. Endobronchial valves have also been shown to be beneficial in treatment of persistent air leaks in the lungs. It has also been theorized that endobronchial valves may be useful for treatment of tuberculosis and its complications. Endobronchial valves may be the first successful medical device treatment of emphysema, a disease that affects billions of patients worldwide and has no known cure, being managed traditionally by lung transplantation and/or lung volume reduction surgery (though some patients do not meet the eligibility requirements for one or both of these invasive procedures).|$|R
50|$|In {{a highly}} {{compliant}} lung, as in emphysema, the elastic tissue is damaged by enzymes. These enzymes are secreted by leukocytes (white blood cells) {{in response to}} a variety of inhaled irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Patients with emphysema have a very high lung compliance due to the poor elastic recoil. They have extreme difficulty <b>exhaling</b> <b>air.</b> In this condition extra work is required to get air out of the lungs. In addition, patients often have difficulties inhaling air as well. This {{is due to the fact}} that a high compliant lung results in many collapsed alveoli which makes inflation difficult. Compliance also increases with increasing age.|$|R
