40|$|A {{computer}} simulation showed that an attic radiant barrier system (RBS) (a commercial product laminated to {{the underside of}} the roof sheathing) significantly reduces cooling load requirements in hot desert climates. This reduction was due to both a reduction in sensible heat transfer through the ceiling and an even greater reduction in losses (<b>heat</b> <b>pickup)</b> by the HVAC ducting system in the attic. These reductions were around 16 % in run time over the daytime hours and an overall 9 % reduction over a five-day period. This latter effect indicates the need to improve current duct-loss calculation methods...|$|E
40|$|A 1 -D {{transient}} model (RESHEAT), {{developed by}} the writers, was used to study the thermal performance of a highly reflective paint applied sequentially to the outer walls and roof of a simulated residence in a hot and arid region of the southwestern United States. The model uses climatological inputs from a file that includes hourly data on ambient temperatures, insolation, cloud cover, and so on, at the particular location. The model focuses particularly on the potential cooling load reduction due to the reduced <b>heat</b> <b>pickup</b> from the inside attic surfaces to the outer surfaces of the supply duct. This simulation showed that a reduction of 33. 6 % (cooling load) on the average is achieved over the base case where no reflective paint is used when the outer surface of the roof and walls are painted. Alternatively, only a 11 % reduction would be achieved if the reflective paint is applied only to the roof. Savings of $ 42 per month are conservatively estimated from calculations made when applying this technology to a typical residence (roof and walls) equipped with a 4 ton refrigeration unit in the Southwest...|$|E
40|$|A {{solar thermal}} {{combination}} {{domestic hot water}} (DHW) and space heating system was retrofitted to a residential dwelling (2800 ft 3 (260 m 3)) in southern MN, USA, (latitude 44. 323 ° N). Since the existing household heating system utilized hydronic baseboard emitters, which are not often seen as a viable option for solar thermal integration, the design of this system posed technical challenges. The integration of several design features were intended to balance competing demands of collector efficiency (better at lower delivery temperatures) and hydronic heating system performance (better at higher temperatures). The design included the following features: 1. Evacuated tube collectors for optimum winter performance. 2. Reduction of the hydronic system delivery temperature allowed {{by the fact that}} the dwelling’s hydronic system was oversized for much of the season. 3. Differential temperature control of the the space <b>heating</b> <b>pickup</b> loop in the solar thermal storage. Solar thermal energy is delivered to the space heating system whenever the solar thermal storage temperature is greater than the return from the hydronic loop. During the first 12 months of operation, the system reduced the natural gas consumption for the hot water and space heating by 34 % compared to an average of the previous 4 years of data, but energy use reductions can also be attributed to improved heating system efficiency from improvements made to the heating system during the installation of the solar thermal system. The analysis presented here attempts to distinguish solar thermal performance from heating system improvements and determine the contributions of the various design features and the solar energy contribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} that demonstrates the ability of a turbulent cascade within the solar wind to heat the thermal protons. Several sources of energy are required to accom-plish the observed heating. Wind shear and shocks originating with the multiple source of wind plasma heat the wind inside 10 AU. However, beyond this distance little is left of these sources and all that remains is the energy injected into the plasma by the pickup of newborn protons origi-nating from interstellar neutrals. Recent advances in the theory of wave excitation by the newborn protons allows us to return to the published heating theory and remove a previously unexplained parameterization of the <b>heating</b> due to <b>pickup</b> protons. Furthermore, recent observational evidence suggests that large-scale correlations between the wind speed and the proton temperature exist into the distant outer heliosphere that motivate an attempt to connect the two within the structure of the heating theory...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBoth hybrid {{and full}} {{particle}} simulations and recent experimental results have clearly evidenced that {{the front of}} a supercritical quasi-perpendicular shock can be nonstationary. One proposed mechanism responsible for this nonstationarity is the self-reformation of the shock front being due to the accumulation of reflected ions. On the other hand, a large number of studies have been made on the acceleration and <b>heating</b> of <b>pickup</b> ions (PIs) but most have been restricted to a stationary shock profile only. Herein, one-dimensional test particle simulations based on shock profiles issued from one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation are performed in order to investigate the impact of the shock front nonstationarity (self-reformation) on the acceleration processes and the resulting energy spectra of PIs (protons H+) at a strictly perpendicular shock. PIs are represented by different shell distributions (variation of the shell velocity radius). The contribution of shock drift acceleration (SDA), shock surfing acceleration (SSA), and directly transmitted (DT) PI's components to the total energy spectra is analyzed. Present results show that (1) both SDA and SSA mechanisms can apply as preacceleration mechanisms for PIs, but their relative energization efficiency strongly differs; (2) SDA and SSA always work together at nonstationary shocks (equivalent to time-varying shock profiles) but SDA, and not SSA, is shown to dominate the formation of high-energy PIs in most cases; (3) the front nonstationarity reinforces the formation of SDA and SSA PIs {{in the sense that it}} increases both their maximum energy and their relative density, independently on the radius of PI's shell velocity; and (4) for high shell velocity around the shock velocity, the middle energy range of the total energy spectrum follows a power law Ek− 1. 5. This power law is supported by both SDA and DT ions (within two separate contributing energy ranges) for a stationary shock and mainly by SDA ions for a nonstationary shock. In both cases, the contribution of SSA ions is comparatively weak...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} of vehicles has received increased attention in recent years; however one neglected area {{that can have}} a large effect on this is the energy usage for the interior climate. This study aims to investigate the energy usage for the interior climate for different conditions by measurements on a complete vehicle. Twelve different NEDC tests in different temperatures and thermal states of the vehicle were completed in a climatic wind tunnel. Furthermore one temperature sweep from 43 ° to– 18 °C was also performed. The measurements focused on the heat flow of the air, from its sources, to its sink, i. e. compartment. In addition the electrical and mechanical loads of the climate system were included. The different sources of heating and cooling were, for the tested powertrain, waste heat from the engine, a fuel operated heater, <b>heat</b> <b>pickup</b> of the air, evaporator cooling and cooling from recirculation. It was found that a separation of the sources and sink was possible and increased {{the understanding of the}} energy usage. Further the study showed that the sources were very dependent on the powertrain and that ambient conditions and thermal state of the vehicle, i. e. thermal load, had a very large impact on the needed energy...|$|E
40|$|The oxides of {{nitrogen}} (NOx) are airborne pollutants that result from the combustion of pulverised coal. The aim of this project is to identify operational methods that reduce the NOx emissions from a coal fired boiler whilst maintaining satisfactory performance. This project describes important combustion properties and the processes occurring during the combustion of pulverised coal. Detail is provided on the pulverisation plant, draught plant and steam system of a large utility boiler. The dominant NOx formation mechanisms in coal fired boilers are discussed and NOx reduction strategies applicable to these boilers are described. Engineering models are developed to describe initial flame temperature, furnace residence times, furnace <b>heat</b> <b>pickup</b> and thermal NOx formation. A series of tests were designed and undertaken to measure and assess the effect on NOx formation and boiler performance to variations in:- - The distribution of secondary air to each windbox, and - The level of excess oxygen measure at the boiler exit. During each test the following was undertaken:- - Detailed temperature survey of the furnace region - Coal sampling for laboratory analysis - Fly Ash sampling to determine loss of ignition - Logs of relevant data to determine plant performance. Difficulties and shortcomings regarding the predictive models are discussed {{and the performance of}} the boiler under each test is compared...|$|E
40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing of the engine in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip seal segment cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an engine representative casing geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised engine casing is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of heat into the flanges was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight necking of the flanges at their root was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the engine casing tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing <b>heat</b> <b>pickup</b> by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the engine casing could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{interstellar}} pickup protons and turbulence on the structure and dynamics of the solar wind, we have developed a fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic solar wind model that treats interstellar pickup protons as a separate fluid and incorporates the transport of turbulence and turbulent heating. The governing system of equations combines the mean-field equations for the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and pickup protons and the turbulence transport equations for the turbulent energy, normalized cross-helicity, and correlation length. The model equations account for photoionization of interstellar hydrogen atoms and their charge exchange with solar wind protons, energy transfer from pickup protons to solar wind protons, and plasma heating by turbulent dissipation. Separate mass and energy equations are used for the solar wind and pickup protons, though a single momentum equation is employed under the assumption that the pickup protons are comoving with the solar wind protons. We compute the global structure of the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and turbulence in the region from 0. 3 to 100 AU for a source magnetic dipole on the Sun tilted by 0 deg -. 90 deg and compare our results with Voyager 2 observations. The results computed with and without pickup protons are superposed to evaluate quantitatively the deceleration and <b>heating</b> effects of <b>pickup</b> protons, the overall compression of the magnetic field in the outer heliosphere caused by deceleration, and the weakening of corotating interaction regions by the thermal pressure of pickup protons...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{models of}} solar wind <b>heating</b> by {{interstellar}} <b>pickup</b> proton-driven turbulence {{have assumed that}} the wind speed is a constant in heliocentric radial position. However, the same pickup process, which is taken to provide the turbulent energy, must also decelerate the wind. In this paper, we extend our phenomenological turbulence model to include variable wind speed, and then incorporate the deceleration due to interstellar pickup protons into the model. We compare the model results with plasma and field data from Voyager 2, taking this opportunity to present an extended and improved data set of proton core temperature, magnetic field fluctuation intensity, and correlation length along the Voyager trajectory. A particular motivation for including the solar wind deceleration in this model is the expectation that a slower wind would reduce the resulting proton core temperature in the region beyond ~ 60 AU, where the previous model predictions were higher than the observed values. However, we find instead that the deceleration of the steady-state wind increases the energy input to the turbulence, causing even higher temperatures in that region. The increased heating is shown to result from the larger values of the ratio of Alfven speed to solar wind speed that develop in the decelerating wind. Jet Propulsion Laboratory (U. S.)

40|$|The {{onset of}} the {{acceleration}} of ions during magnetic reconnection is explored via particle-in-cell simulations {{in the limit of}} a strong ambient guide field that self-consistently and simultaneously follow the motions of protons and α particles. Heating parallel to the local magnetic field during reconnection with a guide field is strongly reduced compared with the reconnection of anti-parallel magnetic fields. The dominant heating of thermal ions during guide field reconnection results from pickup behavior of ions during their entry into reconnection exhausts and dominantly produces heating perpendicular rather than parallel to the local magnetic field. Pickup behavior requires that the ion transit time across the exhaust boundary (with a transverse scale of the order of the ion sound Larmor radius) be short compared with the ion cyclotron period. This translates into a threshold in the strength of reconnecting magnetic field that favors the heating of ions with high mass-to-charge. A simulation with a broad initial current layer produces a reconnecting system in which the amplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field just upstream of the dissipation region increases with time as reconnection proceeds. The sharp onset of perpendicular <b>heating</b> when the <b>pickup</b> threshold is crossed is documented. A comparison of the time variation of the parallel and perpendicular ion heating with that predicted based on the strength of the reconnecting field establishes the scaling of ion heating with ambient parameters both below and above the pickup threshold. The relevance to observations of ion heating in the solar corona is discussed. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1108. 575...|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos hybrid {{simulation}} code is used {{to examine}} heating and the partition of dissipation energy at the perpendicular heliospheric termination shock {{in the presence of}} pickup ions. The simulations are one-dimensional in space but three-dimensional in field and velocity components, and are carried out for a range of values of pickup ion relative density. Results from the simulations show that because the solar wind ions are relatively cold upstream, the temperature of these ions is raised by a relatively larger factor than the temperature of the pickup ions. An analytic model for energy partition is developed {{on the basis of the}} Rankine-Hugoniot relations and a polytropic energy equation. The polytropic index {gamma} used in the Rankine-Hugoniot relations is varied to improve agreement between the model and the simulations concerning the fraction of downstream <b>heating</b> in the <b>pickup</b> ions as well as the compression ratio at the shock. When the pickup ion density is less than 20 %, the polytropic index is about 5 / 3, whereas for pickup ion densities greater than 20 %, the polytropic index tends toward 2. 2, suggesting a fundamental change in the character of the shock, as seen in the simulations, when the pickup ion density is large. The model and the simulations both indicate for the upstream parameters chosen for Voyager 2 conditions that the pickup ion density is about 25 % and the pickup ions gain the larger share (approximately 90 %) of the downstream thermal pressure, consistent with Voyager 2 observations near the shock...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide the}} first direct {{observations}} of interstellar H+ and He+ pickup ions {{in the solar}} wind from 22 AU to 38 AU. We use the Vasyliunas and Siscoe model functional form to quantify the pickup ion distributions, and while the fit parameters generally lie outside their physically expected ranges, this form allows fits that quantify variations in the pickup H+ properties with distance. By ~ 20 AU, the pickup ions already provide the dominant internal pressure in the solar wind. We determine the radial trends and extrapolate them to the termination shock at ~ 90 AU, where the pickup H+ to core solar wind density reaches ~ 0. 14. The pickup H+ temperature and thermal pressure increase from 22 - 38 AU, indicating additional <b>heating</b> of the <b>pickup</b> ions. This produces very large extrapolated ratios of pickup H+ to solar wind temperature and pressure and an extrapolated ratio of the pickup ion pressure to the solar wind dynamic pressure at the termination shock of ~ 0. 16. Such a large ratio has profound implications for moderating the termination shock and the overall outer heliospheric interaction. We also identify suprathermal tails in the H+ spectra and complex features in the He+ spectra, likely indicating variations in the pickup ion history and processing. Finally, we discover enhancements in both H+ and He+ populations just below their cutoff energies, which {{may be associated with}} enhanced local pickup. This study serves to document the release and as the citable reference of these pickup ion data for broad community use and analysis.
