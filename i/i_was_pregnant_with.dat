5000|$|In 2010, Sargent's neighbors on {{the north}} side of Madison urged her to seek the 18th District seat on the Dane County board of {{supervisors}} upon the retirement of the incumbent. [...] "At that point, I owned my own business," [...] she said. [...] "I had three kids, and I just found out <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> my fourth. And I was 40 years old and feeling like one more thing on my plate would cause me to topple over." ...|$|E
5000|$|Caruana {{first started}} writing songs in 2006. Prior to her solo career, she {{provided}} vocals on albums by her husband, John Butler. The Mama Kin band came about through {{playing with her}} brothers Nicky Bomba and Michael Caruana. The name Mama Kin was given her by Bomba, {{a former member of}} the John Butler Trio. Caruana says, [...] "we were toying with the idea of doing a creative project together called Kin. A couple of days into the process I found out <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> my second child and he called me the Mama Kin." [...] When it stuck as her band name she had not heard of the Aerosmith song. Caruana, her brother Michael on keyboards and drummer George Servanis are the principal members of the Mama Kin ensemble.|$|E

My husband, Louis Cohen, was a socialist. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> {{the first of the}} two {{children}} of that marriage. The railroad men supporters came to my house so I could continue to act as local secretary."But a new disappointment was in store for me. The Social Democracy, I soon discovered, was a utopian scheme. Debs' plan was to form an ideal colony out West to show by example that socialism could work. From the outset I told the members of my group that this colonization scheme was unsound, not real socialism at all. I stayed with it for a while because of my loyalty to Debs, and because this was the nearest thing I had yet found to a socialist movement."Debs set up a paper in Chicago called The Social Democrat. At his request I wrote a children's column for it. The children answered the appeals of Debs and his colonization committee by sending me money. I felt it was unfair to collect money for something that did not yet exist. People were already selling out businesses to join the colony. A national convention was held in Chicago 7-11, 1898 and our local sent delegates. Among them was my husband who still felt that anything Debs was in must be all right. I agreed to withhold final judgment until the delegates returned. When they came back and reported that plans to establish the colony would continue, I resigned. I simply could not stay with anything so unscientific.|$|E

5000|$|The album's {{idea came}} when Thalía <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> her first daughter, Sabrina Sakaë. The singer {{was anxious to}} put on her bikini {{and go to the}} beach, as she could not do some things, such as being exposed to the sun. [...] "When I started making this album, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the middle of my pregnancy, and I had only one thought: the summer. My desire was {{to come back to the}} beach and enjoy the summer's temperature. With a wood fire, {{surrounded}} by friends, listening to music under the moonlight; a true lunar". During a press conference on 17 June 2008 in New York City, where Thalía stated:"This album came along when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> my daughter. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost eight months pregnant. I had had it, and the only thing I could think about were bikinis, suntan lotion, beer and the beach. So I began to think to myself, 'Hey! What <b>was</b> that song <b>I</b> liked last summer in Argentina? 'Sangre Caliente' ("Hot blood")! And when I went with my friends to (the Mexican beach resort of) Ixtapa, which one was it? That's right! The one by Juan Gabriel!' ... That's how 'Lunada' was born".|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the video's {{inadvertent}} fame, the boys gained recognition. Following the video, multiple clips were uploaded by their father to YouTube. They feature Jasper, the third child in the family. [...] Shelley Davies-Carr, their mother, told The Sun in 2010 that [...] "a lot of people like seeing Harry and Charlie growing up and following the family story. They knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> Jasper and now they're watching him grow up." [...] In the same article Howard noted, however, that he has [...] "deliberately kept away from the personal bits. You don't see their birthdays, school plays or things like the first they cycled. All I do is put up one clip every six weeks and an awful lot happens every six weeks." [...] Howard has stated that he will not continue to upload videos of his children when they grow older. He said in 2010 that [...] "I don't know if they'll take it over. I'd like to think they'd have an interest, but it will be their decision." [...] Shelley commented on the success: [...] "Susan Boyle has never had the hits we have had. The video got on to a college networking site in the U.S. and from there it went viral. I think the British accents have helped make it so globally viewed." [...] According to a 2008 interview with Shelley, the boys get embarrassed when they see themselves on television. She also noted that in 2008 they were [...] "shy about their new fame." [...] Howard commented in 2009 that his sons [...] "are now almost legendary. People want their autographs, it's just crazy." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an Old School - Back to the 80s {{interview}} from 2011, Decker was asked how the reformation {{of the band}} came to fruition. She replied [...] "I decided in 1998, after meeting a new manager, to start work again after years of no confidence. We toured [...] "Red", my fourth album, and put it out on my label Gnatfish. I would've loved to have gotten {{the same level of}} success again but it didn't happen although I did sell a lot of albums on the road. I was no longer bankrolled, so I couldn't get the PR and TV coverage which you so need." [...] In a 2013 interview for Super Deluxe Edition writer Paul Sinclair, Decker spoke of the album in relation to being a mother and touring commitments. [...] "I had an album out called [...] "Red" [...] in 1998 and I recorded that when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> my daughter, who is now 14. I toured it up and down the UK, and then I went across Europe with Status Quo and I left her behind when she was six months old. I sulked my way across Germany - it was just awful. I hadn’t been a mum before. Scarlett was incredibly healthy, my mother moved in to help look after her. I left her safe and sound and well sorted, but I didn’t take into consideration being a new mother, separated from her daughter after six months, with hormones raging… I was in bits. So consequently I haven’t toured, with a capital ‘t’, since then, which is where all these eighties shows have come in brilliantly." [...] T'Pau, including Rogers, would embark on a 28-date UK tour during the spring of 2013, to mark the 25th anniversary of the formation of the band.|$|E

Because they helped me, you know they took me under their wing and they’re like okay, well, let’s go, you know look at Section  8 (rental assistance to low-income families), let’s go do this, let’s go do that.

5000|$|The line of {{succession}} of the counts of Champagne had become complicated {{in the current}} generation. Count Henry I had two sons with Marie of Champagne, Henry II and Theobald III. Henry II succeeded as count on his father's death, but left France {{within a few years}} to fight in the Third Crusade. Before he left in 1190, Henry II had his barons swear that should he never return, his younger brother Theobald III was his designated heir. The problem was that Henry II never returned from the Latin East, but instead chose to marry the then-heiress to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Queen Isabella I - eight days after the assassination of her husband Conrad of Montferrat, which Henry II might possibly have had a hand in orchestrating. Moreover, Isabella <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already visibly <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> Conrad's child - Maria of Jerusalem, who later married John of Brienne - thus the marriage was considered scandalous by many. Henry II fathered two daughters with Maria, Queen Alice of Cyprus and Philippa.|$|R

40|$|When {{my mother}} Judith was {{diagnosed}} with pancreatic cancer in 2005, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> my second child, Rosemary Judith, and was frantically trying to finish up my dissertation on Judith Butler. By the time my mom died in 2009, I had lived with and cared for my daughter Rosemary Judith for over three years and had read, written about, presented on, and taught Butler’s Precarious Life and Undoing Gender many times. This essay is an experimental attempt at juxtaposing my experiences of living and grieving beside three different Judiths: my mom, Judith; my academic muse, Judith Butler; and my daughter, Rosemary Judith. My {{goal is not to}} connect these experiences in any easy or seamless way, but to put them beside each other in the hopes of presenting one person’s (as daugh-ter/scholar/mother) tentative and unfinished account of grief, loss and the livable and not so livable life. My mom Judith died last year on September 30. Diagnosed with a particularly nasty form of cancer—pancreatic—back in October of 2005, she had defied the odds by living for four years: {{three and a half years}} longer than expected...|$|E
