The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little <b>information</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how necessary keys could be obtained. The author elaborated in another forum post, claiming that keys could be obtained by exploiting the necessity {{for them to be}} held in memory to allow playback in player software.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with <b>information</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E

We found that the latter is distinctly the larva of "Surume-ika", because it has the first bud of tentacle hidden the mantle membrane and the round slit of the integument covering the eye...|$|R
50|$|Since {{players can}} only ask for cards {{they do not}} possess, using the {{questions}} asked {{to others in the}} game, a player can deduce the card or set of cards a player has. The best strategy for a player is <b>to</b> emit <b>as</b> much <b>information</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>to</b> his team-mates while simultaneously emitting <b>as</b> little <b>information</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>to</b> his opponents. Thus good strategy consists not only of asking for some cards that one needs, but not prematurely divulging the existence of all half-suits they have. Players need both strategy and memory skills to win the game.|$|R
