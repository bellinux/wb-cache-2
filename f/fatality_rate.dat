5|$|Most {{people with}} dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> is 1–5%, {{and less than}} 1% with {{adequate}} treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> of up to 26%. Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For {{the decade of the}} 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the population at risk. This makes {{it one of the most}} common vector-borne diseases worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The overall case-fatality {{rate for}} ordinary-type {{smallpox}} is about 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 {{percent of the}} time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, {{in cases where the}} rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> for children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> for flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 percent or less. There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: I {{compared}} <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> {{between the}} baseline and current study periods, estimated annual fatalities, monthly fatalities, {{and examined the}} data for signs of mitigation effectiveness and differences between repowered and old-generation wind turbines and whether mean <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> relate to wind turbine size. I found that <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> were not reduced between the baseline and current study periods. APWRA-wide <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> were close to those estimated by Smallwood and Karas (2009). Although <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> over the current study generally confirmed that relatively hazardous turbines had been identified through rating systems, delays in turbine relocations/removals prevented measuring the effectiveness of removal measures that were required by permits and recommended by the SRC. Similarly, the ability to detect the effectiveness of winter shutdowns was limited because the shutdowns were too brief, inconsistent, and poorly monitored {{for the first two}} years. However, I found that mean <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> declined substantially with increasing turbine size for most species, though they increased for bats and for golden eagle. Repowering projects generally killed many fewer birds per MW per year than did the old-generation turbines. I also found that <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> varied considerably from year to year, and that monthly <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> closely corresponded with monthly utilizatio...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to {{stabilise}} worldwide road <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> the World Health Organization has highlighted the need for comprehensive in-country laws addressing five key risk factors: speed, drink driving, motorcycle helmets, seatbelts and child restraints. However, the effectiveness of laws covering these five key factors may be dependent on the governance of the country implementing these laws. This study sought to determine if there is a correlation between governance and road <b>fatality</b> <b>rates.</b> To do this, data on six governance indices from the World Bank and road <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> from the World Health Organization covering over 176 countries was obtained. A Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed on this data. The findings indicate that there is a negative correlation between key governance indices and road <b>fatality</b> <b>rates.</b> The finding from this study highlights the importance of good governance as {{part of the}} effort to reduce worldwide <b>fatality</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the US, {{the case}} <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> is {{estimated}} to be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the figures in Table  9, unlike immigrants, low-skilled native youth do not seem to work in jobs with higher injury or <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> than other natives. However, low-skilled native youth have been hard hit by the recent {{economic}} downturn. Given their experienced workload reductions, 16 we would expect the recession to have lowered their work injury and <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> to a greater extent that those of other natives. And, indeed, the economic downturn reduced both the work injury and <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> of low-skilled native youth by 87 accidents and 0.39 deaths per 100, 000 workers. According to the figures in Additional file 1 : Table S 3, these declines amount to approximately a 9.5 percent and a 4.5 percent reduction in their occupation work injury and <b>fatality</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively.|$|R

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibodies}} {{induced by}} vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (smallpox) viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine {{has been effective}} in preventing smallpox infection in 95 percent of those vaccinated. Smallpox vaccination provides {{a high level of}} immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3 percent; it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the impact of}} drinking and driving laws on drinking and driving <b>fatality</b> <b>rates,</b> this study explored the different effects these laws have on areas with varying severity rates for drinking and driving. Unlike previous studies, this study employed quantile regression analysis. Empirical results showed that policies based on local conditions must be used to effectively reduce drinking and driving fatality rates; that is, different measures should be adopted to target the specific conditions in various regions. For areas with low <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> (low quantiles), people’s habits and attitudes toward alcohol should be emphasized instead of transportation safety laws because “preemptive regulations” are more effective. For areas with high <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> (or high quantiles), “ex-post regulations” are more effective, and impact these areas approximately 0. 01 % to 0. 05 % {{more than they do}} areas with low <b>fatality</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Legal {{systems of}} {{countries}} include laws, regulations and procedures that may deter acts harmful to others. Deterrence incentives created by legal systems underlie effects {{documented in the}} Law and Finance literature, which has shown that legal systems can offer protection to investors against expropriation. This protection in turn fosters {{the development of a}} country's financial markets. Incentives created by legal system can extend beyond investor protection, deterring other types of harmful acts as well. This study presents evidence on deterrence incentives in other areas, finding that <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> from motor vehicle accidents and from other types of accidents vary significantly across countries classified by origin of legal system. Motor vehicle accident <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> in countries whose legal systems are based on English Common Law generally have been lower than those in civil law countries, especially countries with legal systems based on French Civil Code or former members of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries. <b>Fatality</b> <b>rates</b> from other types of accidents are lowest in common-law countries; followed by those in French, then German, then Scandinavian Civil Code countries, with the highest <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> occurring in former Eastern Bloc and Soviet Union countries. The pattern of motor vehicle accident <b>fatality</b> <b>rates</b> resembles patterns of corporate control values found in the Law and Finance literature, which is evidence that aspects of a country=s legal system protecting investors also deter other types of possibly harmful acts.

5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{virus has}} been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a <b>fatality</b> <b>rate</b> of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
