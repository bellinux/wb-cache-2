5|$|Liquid sugars {{are strong}} syrups {{consisting}} of 67% <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> dissolved in water. They {{are used in}} the food processing {{of a wide range of}} products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, {{with less than}} 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar {{contains}} a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Sugar cubes (sometimes called sugar lumps) {{are white}} or brown <b>granulated</b> <b>sugars</b> lightly steamed and pressed {{together}} in block shape. They {{are used to}} sweeten drinks.|$|R
5|$|Brown <b>sugars</b> are <b>granulated</b> <b>sugars,</b> either {{containing}} residual molasses, or {{with the}} grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light- or dark-colored sugar. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and toffees.|$|R
5|$|<b>Granulated</b> <b>sugars</b> {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|R
5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.|$|E
25|$|To produce <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{in which}} {{individual}} grains do not clump, sugar must be dried, first by heating in a rotary dryer, {{and then by}} blowing cool air through it for several days.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{was opened}} in 1926 with a seating {{capacity}} of roughly 35,000--the {{lower level of}} the final configuration's sideline seats. Tulane Stadium was built on Tulane University's campus (before 1871, Tulane's campus was Paul Foucher's Plantation, where Foucher's father-in-law, Étienne de Boré, had first <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> from cane syrup).|$|E
50|$|Fructose is a dietary {{monosaccharide}} present {{naturally in}} fruits and vegetables, either as free fructose or {{as part of}} the disaccharide sucrose, and as its polymer inulin. It is also present in the form of refined <b>sugars</b> including <b>granulated</b> <b>sugars</b> (white crystalline table sugar, brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, and turbinado sugar), refined crystalline fructose and as high fructose corn syrups. About 10% of the calories contained in the Western diet are supplied by fructose (approximately 55 g/day).|$|R
40|$|Currently, <b>granulated</b> palm <b>sugar</b> (palm suiker) {{with local}} name “gula semut” becameknown and {{generally}} produced for export market and partly for domestic food industry. Great market prospects for <b>granulated</b> palm <b>sugar</b> {{can not be}} utilized by communitybecause majority of producers make solid (molded) palm sugar. In the district of RokanHulu, <b>granulated</b> palm <b>sugar</b> is only produced by one producer. This research is a casestudy of <b>granulated</b> palm <b>sugar</b> producer with the aims to study: (1) marketing strategyof granulated palm sugar; (2) external and internal marketing factors, and (3) alternativemarketing strategy. Analysis of qualitative description is to describe the marketing ofgranulated palm sugar {{in the form of}} marketing mix (product, price, promotion anddistribution). A quantitative analysis carried out to develop a marketing strategy withSWOT analysis. Conclusions of research: (1) product strategy of granulated palm sugaris applied through packaging attributes of halal label, barcode, license, product benefits,and area of origin; (2) the price of the sugar is Rp 30, 000 per kg which is considered tooexpensive; (3) promotion strategy is still limited on personal selling by word of mouth;(4) strategy is direct distribution to consumers, and (5) recommended strategy is tomaintain the label and the brand and introduce product to general public, encourageproducers not to make wine to maintain continuity of the sugar production, set priceaccording to production costs while considering purchasing power, maintain healthstandard, and do continuous promotional activities...|$|R
50|$|Particle size is {{variable}} {{but generally}} less than <b>granulated</b> white <b>sugar.</b> Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may {{be based on}} caster sugar which has crystals of approximately 0.35 mm.|$|R
25|$|Honey {{gets its}} {{sweetness}} from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has {{about the same}} relative sweetness as <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar.</b> It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|As a sweetener, HFCS {{is often}} {{compared}} to <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include {{that it is}} easier to handle and more cost-effective. The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners. Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow during the early 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|Carbon snake is a {{demonstration}} of the dehydration reaction of sugar by concentrated sulfuric acid. With concentrated sulfuric acid, <b>granulated</b> table <b>sugar</b> (sucrose) performs degradation reaction which changes its form to black solid-liquid mixture. [...] Carbon snake experiment can sometimes be misrecognized as Black snake, [...] "sugar snake," [...] or [...] "burning sugar" [...] which involve the reaction with baking soda instead of sulfuric acid.|$|R
25|$|A sugar packet is a {{delivery}} method for one 'serving' of sugar. Sugar packets are commonly supplied in restaurants and coffee bars in preference to sugar bowls or sugar dispensers {{for reasons of}} neatness, spill control, {{and to some extent}} portion control. In 1957, the sugar packet that consisted of a <b>granulated</b> low-calorie <b>sugar</b> substitute, was invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, the founder of Cumberland Packing or better known today as the Sweet 'N Low company.|$|R
5000|$|The flesh {{surrounding}} the dried seeds swells to eight times its original volume when soaked in water, forming an irregularly shaped, reddish gelatinous mass. After being soaked and the seed kernel removed, the flesh {{is mixed with}} <b>granulated</b> white <b>sugar,</b> ice, and soaked basil seeds, and drunk as a cooling drink in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. They are sometimes also used, along with other ingredients, in sweet, cool soups similar to the Chinese tong sui.http://home-and-garden.webshots.com/photo/1409669531060513019KTwSeg ...|$|R
500|$|A lemon drop is {{typically}} prepared straight up, {{meaning that it}} is shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as a martini glass. The glass may be prepared with a sugared rim, performed by dipping {{the rim of the}} glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into a rimmer (a shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called [...] "bar sugar", [...] "caster sugar", [...] "castor sugar" [...] and [...] "ultrafine sugar"), which is more finely ground compared to standard <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> is sometimes used for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|White {{refined sugar}} is {{typically}} sold as <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{which has been}} dried to prevent clumping and comes in various crystal sizes for home and industrial use: ...|$|E
2500|$|Granulated, {{familiar}} as table sugar, {{with a grain}} size about 0.5mm across. [...] "Sugar cubes" [...] are lumps for convenient consumption produced by mixing <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> with sugar syrup.|$|E
5000|$|Wedang Jahe {{is a type}} of Indonesian ginger tea. Wedang in Javanese means [...] "hot beverage" [...] while jahe means [...] "ginger". Although {{devoid of}} any {{caffeine}} content, it is often served and enjoyed as an invigorating tea. It is made from ginger rhizome, usually fresh and cut in thin slices, and palm <b>sugar</b> or <b>granulated</b> cane <b>sugar,</b> frequently with the addition of fragrant pandan leaves. Palm sugar can be substituted with brown sugar or honey. Traditionally people might add spices such as lemongrass, cloves and/or cinnamon stick.|$|R

2500|$|If the {{prolapse}} becomes trapped externally {{outside the}} anal sphincters, {{it may become}} strangulated {{and there is a}} risk of perforation. [...] This may require an urgent surgical operation if the prolapse cannot be manually reduced. Applying <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> on the exposed rectal tissue can reduce the edema (swelling) and facilitate this.|$|E
2500|$|When World War II began, Fooks dropped many of {{his other}} brands, such as Botl-O and Sunburst, in order to focus on Grapette. [...] Sales of Grapette {{continued}} to soar during the war, despite restrictions and material shortages. [...] Sugar, which was subject to wartime rationing, was obtained by adding water to <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> thus liquefying it, enabling it to be sold as syrup, which was not subject to rationing.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1830s, the Company {{made several}} {{investments}} to further East Boston's development. They continued {{attempts to get}} the Eastern Railroad to come to East Boston. [...] The Maverick and East Boston ferries began service from Lewis Wharf on the mainland to East Boston. [...] A bridge to Chelsea was built, roads were laid out, and houses were built. Much of this activity was spurred by {{the formation of the}} East Boston Lumber Company. During this period, the Boston Sugar Refinery was also founded, which was the first manufacturing establishment in East Boston. [...] They are credited for the creation of white <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shortbread is a biscuit {{traditionally}} {{made from}} one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three parts flour. Other ingredients like ground rice or cornflour are sometimes added to alter the texture.

50|$|A sugarloaf was {{the usual}} form in which refined sugar was {{produced}} and sold until the late 19th century, when <b>granulated</b> and cube <b>sugars</b> were introduced. A tall cone with a rounded top was the end-product of {{a process in which}} the dark molasses-rich raw sugar, which was imported from sugar cane growing regions such as the Caribbean and Brazil, refined into white sugar.|$|R
2500|$|Caster (or castor) (0.35mm), a {{very fine}} sugar in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, so-named because the grains are {{small enough to fit}} through a castor which is small vessel with a {{perforated}} top, from which to sprinkle sugar at table. Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as [...] "superfine" [...] sugar in the United States. Because of its fineness, it dissolves more quickly than regular white sugar and is thus especially useful in meringues and cold liquids. Castor sugar can be prepared at home by grinding <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> {{for a couple of minutes}} in a mortar or food processor.|$|E
2500|$|New Orleans {{is known}} for {{specialties}} including beignets (locally pronounced like [...] "ben-yays"), square-shaped fried dough that could be called [...] "French doughnuts" [...] (served with café au lait made with a blend of coffee and chicory rather than only coffee); and Po-boy and Italian Muffuletta sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, fried oysters, boiled crawfish and other seafood; étouffée, jambalaya, gumbo and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of red beans and rice.
