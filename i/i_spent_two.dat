5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> {{and a half years in}} a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Matthew West's new album, [...] "My Own Little World" [...] was {{released}} on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E

[...] "Berkeley was just a world of pedants. It was truly shocking. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> or three years in the philosophy program. I have very bad feelings about it," [...] he later said. He became a regular at the Pacific Film Archive. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: [...] "He was a film noir nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Are you ambitious, reader, of {{dwelling}} in a [...] "pleasant cot in {{a tranquil}} spot, with a distant {{view of the}} changing sea?" [...] If so, {{do not go to}} York Factory.

60|$|With these {{thoughts}} I resolved to remove my tent {{from the place}} where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent.

60|$|At Effuenta I found Mr. MacLennan, {{the manager}} whom we last met at Axim.

60|$|Furthermore, my disgust {{had been}} {{heightened}} by the one day I had spent in Ottawa {{trying to get an}} outfit of clothing for my long journey.

60|$|As {{we got on}} {{with the}} thing I found myself almost keenly interested.
