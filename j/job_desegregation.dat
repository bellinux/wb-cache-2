40|$|Operation Breadbasket was a Southern Christian Leadership Conference {{project that}} {{was founded in}} 1962, and was {{dedicated}} to improving the economic conditions of black communities across the United States. This thesis shows how the economic agenda of the early Operation Breadbasket - to facilitate integration in the workplace - gave way to its later counterpart which embraced a friendlier attitude toward capitalism and was more solicitous of the black middle class. In particular, this thesis identifies the personalities and events responsible for this transformation while pointing to me broader trends in American capitalism that made the advocacy of workplace integration increasingly less important than access to capital and mass consumption. Since {{there is not a}} dedicated study on Operation Breadbasket, this thesis begins to fill that gap in historiography. Drawing on archival research and original oral histories collected through interviews with veterans, this thesis reconsiders Jesse Jackson's historical role in the success of Operation Breadbasket as an empowerment organization enlarging economic opportunities for black workers and entrepreneurs, In particular, it 'argues that Operation Breadbasket was a remarkable program that contributed to the convergence of me Black Church-driven Civil Rights Movement and the activist-based Black Power struggle in the economic arena. To fully appreciate the transformation of Operation Breadbasket's activities from a more traditional Civil Rights program pursuing <b>job</b> <b>desegregation</b> to a militant, innovative campaign addressing issues such as black business development, the more recent scholarly work on Black Power and its intersection with the Civil Right Movement has been taken into account.

5|$|The Birmingham {{campaign}} {{was a model}} of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his <b>job,</b> forced <b>desegregation</b> in Birmingham, and directly {{paved the way for}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States.|$|R
25|$|Approximately 20 more {{banks were}} {{established}} during this period, which also saw African Americans become active citizens by {{taking part in}} various social movements centered around economic equality, better housing, better <b>jobs,</b> and the <b>desegregation</b> of society. Through desegregation however, these banks could no longer solely depend on the Black community for business and were forced to become established on the open market, by paying their employees competitive wages, and were now required {{to meet the needs}} of the entire society instead of just the Black community.|$|R
50|$|In January, 2003, {{the union}} offered {{to enter into}} binding {{arbitration}} with the university, but administrators refused the offer. A one-week-long strike took place between March 3 and March 7, 2003, garnering support from Cornel West, Jesse Jackson, John Sweeney, Dennis Rivera, John Wilhelm, and Andy Stern, as well as thousands of workers, thousands {{of members of the}} community who marched on the university on the strike's first day to demand equal access to <b>jobs</b> and the <b>desegregation</b> of the university's hiring structures, and hundreds of undergraduates, who staged a walkout on the strike's snowy fourth day and held classes in the street.|$|R
50|$|After {{the ruling}} in Brown v. Board of Education, Missouri Attorney General John M. Dalton issued a {{recommendation}} that Missouri's school segregation laws were void. Despite this, several Missouri districts refused {{to comply with}} the ruling; schools in Charleston avoided integration until the mid-1960s, along with several other Bootheel districts. In many cases, black students were assigned to schools more than 30 miles from their homes, beyond white schools, and many libraries and parks remained off limits to black students. In addition, many black teachers were laid off after integration. In Moberly, eleven black teachers were laid off in 1955, and more than 125 teachers lost their <b>jobs</b> in mid-Missouri. <b>Desegregation</b> in St. Louis and Kansas City took place in 1955, but it nonetheless was a slow process.|$|R
