25|$|I enquired {{throughout}} Italy at what place {{boys were}} chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan {{that it was}} at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples... {{it is said that}} there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' ("Here boys are castrated"); but I was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops <b>during</b> <b>my</b> residence in that city.|$|E

25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret society—a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it would come out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin <b>during</b> <b>my</b> initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that <b>during</b> <b>my</b> two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E

25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing <b>during</b> <b>my</b> 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E

I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E

He believed that the snow had [...] "all but stopped" [...] and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and ploughs, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had landed around the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had [...] "picked up a lot of snow quickly <b>during</b> <b>my</b> post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it seemed to be more rain." [...] He described Flight 405 as a [...] "fairly clean airplane." [...] He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow.|$|E
500|$|In Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a {{biography}} by Napoleon's private secretary, Louis de Bourrienne, {{he notes that}} Le souper de Beaucaire was reprinted as a book– the first edition issued {{at the cost of}} the Public Treasury in August 1798, and a second edition in 1821, following Napoleon's death. He also states, [...] "It was <b>during</b> <b>my</b> absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of chef de bataillon , performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall not speak of it as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production, entitled Le Souper de Beaucaire, the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden was {{involved}} in crafting many federal crime laws. He spearheaded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, {{also known as the}} Biden Crime Law, which included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004 after its ten-year sunset period and was not renewed. It also included the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat domestic violence. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Morrison that the section of VAWA allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence exceeded Congress's authority and therefore was unconstitutional. Congress reauthorized VAWA in 2000 and 2005. Biden has said, [...] "I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've crafted <b>during</b> <b>my</b> 35-year tenure in the Senate." [...] In 2004 and 2005, Biden enlisted major American technology companies in diagnosing the problems of the Austin, Texas-based National Domestic Violence Hotline, and to donate equipment and expertise to it in a successful effort to improve its services.|$|E
