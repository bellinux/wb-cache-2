40|$|When match {{formation}} is costly and wage determination is decentralized, privately optimal investments in job and worker quality diverge from socially efficient outcomes. To explore this issue, I consider search equilibrium environments with endogenous quality distributions {{for jobs and}} workers. I show that a search equilibrium with decentralized wage setting exhibits excessive relative supplies of inferior jobs and inferior workers. Moreover, there are fundamental tensions between the standard wage-setting condition for an efficient total supply of jobs (and workers) in two-sided search models and the conditions required for efficient mixes of jobs and workers. I also derive the efficient wage structure, contrast its properties to the decentralized wage structure and evaluate the welfare and productivity gains of moving to an efficient wage structure. Numerical exercises show that centralized bargaining between a labor union and an <b>employer</b> <b>confederation</b> over the structure of wages can improve productivity and welfare by compressing job-related wage differentials. ...|$|R
40|$|Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action has {{provided}} the dominant framework for understanding the impact of encompassing unions and <b>employers</b> <b>confederations</b> on wage-setting in Western Europe. In particular, scholars have drawn upon Olson's writing to descripe corporatism {{as a means for}} attaining the collective goods of low unemployment and low inflation in highly unionized labor markets. The strongest impact of corporatist institutions in the labor market, however, was to generate greater wage equality rather than superior macroeconomic performance. To understand the most important impact of corporatist institutions, a new framework that emphasizes the effect of wage-setting institutions on the distribution of wages and salaries is needed. In this paper, we present one component of such a framework with a model that illustrates how both employers and unions might gain by central agreements that reduce wage inequality relative to the equilibrium wage distribution with decentralized wage-setting.

3000|$|The modes {{approach}} {{is based on}} Traxler et al. (2001). One such mode is state-imposed bargaining based on statutory controls, examples of which are today restricted to just Belgium and Greece. State-sponsored bargaining or social pacts (see Section  4) are an altogether more common type and have been deployed consistently in Finland and Ireland (where they have dominated recent experience) {{as well as the}} Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. A third mode, inter-associational bargaining, which refers to binding central agreements as practiced in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in the 1980 s, is today a rarity—the sole contemporary example being Spain—partly by reason of the decline in the market share of these peak organizations. Pattern bargaining, on the other hand, is a more familiar vehicle of contemporary coordination, and is dominant in Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Japan. Intra-associational or the so-called informal coordination occurs where guidance is offered by the major union or <b>employer</b> <b>confederations</b> without agreements between themselves. Finally, an absence of coordination—the uncoordinated bargaining mode—may nevertheless exhibit coordination where there is some external influence upon wage bargaining. The classic example is the minimum wage machinery of SMIC (Salaire Minimum de Croissance) in France which shores up an entire wage structure. 12 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Labour {{migration}} to Sweden is analysed from an employer perspective. The {{purpose of this}} study is twofold: first, to determine how the Swedish <b>Employer</b> <b>Confederation</b> (SAF) and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) were affected by labour scarcity; and second, to explore how SAF and LO tried to influence supply and demand on the labour market by controlling the stream of labour immigrants between 1945 and 1972. This thesis also questions whether the so-called Swedish Model was based on consensus between employers and trade unions, as it is usually claimed. As regards theory, the thesis focuses on collective action and how employer organisations and trade unions try to avoid competition among buyers and sellers by using cartel strategies. Although previous research has identified the trade unions’ rhetoric and actions regarding labour migration, hardly any attention has been given to the employers. This thesis comprises thus the first systematic study of how SAF tried to increase the labour supply by immigration. The employers’ ability to increase the labour supply was limited by the close relations and cooperation between the trade unions and the Social Democratic Party government, as well as the trade unions influence over the National Labour Market Board. SAF lacked an equally powerful ally. Because of labour scarcity LO agreed to increase the labour supply in the 1940 s, as long as the native workers’ position was not threatened. SAF on the other hand meant that LO restricted the inflow of foreign labour and thereby maintained the excess demand for labour. In the mid 1950 s Sweden implemented a more liberal migration policy which to a large extent pleased SAF, even though LO could still regulate non-Nordic immigration. In the 1960 s the trade unions started to criticise the liberal migration policy and used their relations with the government to implement strict regulations. As a result LO could control all non-Nordic immigration. SAF protested against the new regulations but the government did not heed to the employers will...|$|R
40|$|Absenteeism is {{increasingly}} becoming {{an area of}} concern for Employers. In these economically challenging times when Employers are focusing on cost cutting across their businesses, absenteeism {{is an area that}} is being highlighted as an issue in need of addressing. Because of competitive pressures, Companies {{can no longer afford to}} carry absenteeism that they may have tolerated in the past (www. ibec. ie). In 2010, the Irish Business and <b>Employer’s</b> <b>Confederation</b> (IBEC) calculated the cost per employee to be € 818 per annum resulting in a loss to the Irish exchequer of € 1. 5 billion (IBEC Absence Survey, 2010). What is Absenteeism? Huczynski and Fitzpatrick defined Absence as “the non-attendance of employees for scheduled work when they are expected to attend” (1989, p. 4). Harrison and Prices (2003) defined Absence as “the lack of physical presence at a behaviour setting when and where one is expected to be” (Harrison and Prices (2003) as cited by Shapira-Lishchinksy and Rosenblatt, 2003, p. 204). Absence Management is the term used to reduce levels of absenteeism through the introduction of policies and procedures. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found in their Absence Management Survey 2010 that Public Sector employees’ average absenteeism levels are 9. 7 days per employee per year in comparison to the Private Sector’s at 6. 6 days. This rate may come under increased scrutiny because of reform in the Irish Public Sector. “High absence levels obviously reduce productivity but also have knock-on effects as other employees may be placed under increased pressure and stress” (CIPD, Absence Management Survey, 2010, p. 10). The subject of Absenteeism has been researched under many different headings over the years. Examples of such Studies eing: “contrasted paid with unpaid absences, organisationally excused with organisationally unexcused absence, genuine with false reasons for absence, voluntary with involuntary” (Huczynski and Fitzpatrick, 1989, p. 4). The “science” of Absence Management is a vast topic and encompasses areas of Management Theory such as motivation, organisational behaviour, job satisfaction, employee engagement and communication, costs, measurements and recording processes. Due to the broad nature of the subject and the limitations of the thesis itself, the Author has decided to focus on the causes of absenteeism and will evaluate Company X in terms of what factors impact on absence within the organisation. This will be done through the gathering and dissemination of thoughts and opinions of Senior Management and Employees through a combination of interviews and a questionnaires supplemented by secondary data gathered from academic journals and various employer organisations such as IBEC and CIPD. The Author will highlight the importance of calculating the cost of absence together with providing information on the measurements available. Absence has been researched by sociologists and psychologists for many years. It draws on motivational and behavioural theories. The Author has researched many of the most common reasons and discussed them. The chapter on research methodology provides an insight into how the Author conducted the research. The Author is using an organisation she is familiar with as a case study. The organisation will be referred to as Company X. This is to ensure confidentiality regarding the findings and information provided. Following the Author’s own research into Company X, she has made recommendations which the Company could adopt to provide a more comprehensive absence management policy. In conclusion, the Author will summarise her findings based on her own research and that of current academic thinking on the subject...|$|R

For most of Algeria's political history, the socialist orientation of the state precluded {{the development of a}} class of small business owners, and resulted in strong, public, anti-capitalist sentiment. Economic liberalization under Benjedid transformed many state-owned enterprises into private entities, and fostered the growth of an active and cohesive group of professional associations of small business owners, or patronat. The patronat, which consists of well over 10,000 members and counting, has strongly supported government reforms, and has persisted in its lobbying efforts.
