5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only {{to the fact that he}} had been without food or water for three days.|$|E
25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} held on 21 May 2012 {{concerning}} the Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum, Pat Kenny {{got down on}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and shouted at a farmer in the audience to shut up. He also promised a debate on the CAP [...] "in January"scheduling of which would have occurred two months after {{it was announced that}} The Frontline had been axed.|$|E
60|$|While the two Rovers waited {{behind a}} {{convenient}} rock, Cujo crawled forward on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> into the cave. They waited for ten minutes, just then it seemed an hour, {{but he did}} not reappear.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; I guess there's enough. Let's count them." [...] He stooped over on <b>his</b> <b>hand's</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> made {{as much of}} {{counting}} the bunches as he could. [...] "There's about one bunch and a half a piece. How shall we carry them? We ought to come into camp as impressively as possible." ...|$|R
500|$|The first {{match of}} the night was The Can-Am Connection (Rick Martel and Tom Zenk) versus Ace Cowboy Bob Orton and The Magnificent Muraco (with Mr. Fuji). This match ended when Martel gave Muraco a high cross-body with Zenk on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> giving Muraco what Gorilla Monsoon called [...] "A little schoolboy trip from behind" [...] {{allowing}} Martel to get the win for his team.|$|E
500|$|Henderson was {{so proud}} of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest. In 2002, {{following}} an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, [...] "He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is." ...|$|E

Regional variations in the iconography of Krishna are seen in his different forms, such as Jaganatha in Odisha, Vithoba in Maharashtra, Shrinathji in Rajasthan and Guruvayoorappan in Kerala ...|$|E
50|$|Karim {{said the}} burn scars on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> were from <b>his</b> childhood. His mother {{told him that}} when he was a toddler she had turned her back and he had tried to crawl on the cooking stove. He {{expressed}} skepticism that his pattern of burns, to two isolated parts of his body, could have been caused by an explosion.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the last}} 'e see of it, {{although}} he 'ad Sam out o' bed and all the clothes stripped off of it twice. He spent over arf an hour on <b>his</b> <b>'ands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> looking for it, and Sam said when {{he was tired of}} playing bears p'r'aps he'd go to bed and get to sleep like a Christian.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> {{were gone}} from the table. He was once more his old self, so {{completely}} the servant {{that for a moment}} even Pamela was puzzled. It seemed as though {{the events of the last}} few seconds might have been part of a disordered dream. Nikasti played to the cue of her fevered question and entirely ignored them. He opened the door with a respectful flourish--and John Lutchester walked in.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is a life-size, cast bronze {{figure of}} a man on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> [...] The man’s head is bent toward the ground, and his posture is tensed {{as if he is}} trying not to collapse further. [...] Both hands and both feet are in contact with the horizontal bronze base, which is approximately two inches thick; his proper left knee is also connected to this base. [...] His proper right leg is in a position of moving slightly forward. [...] The surface of the bronze is highly textured and carries a brown patina, with the texture allowing some areas of brighter bronze to show through.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{rather than}} lifting the {{opponent}} or throwing him for grand amplitude {{in order to}} win the period as in the international styles, the collegiate wrestler most often seeks to take his opponent down to the mat and perform a [...] "breakdown" [...] (that is, to get his opponent in the defensive position flat on his stomach or side). With the opponent off of his base of support (that is, off of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees),</b> the collegiate wrestler in the offensive position would then seek to run pinning combinations, or combinations of techniques designed to secure a fall. Failing to gain a fall could still result in an advantage in riding time and potential nearfall points.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{subsequent}} enquiry and manslaughter/assault trial against Kitching and Ellerker, it was stated they regularly beat-up Oluwale, often kicking {{him in the}} groin and, on one occasion, urinating on him. Often they made him bow before them on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> during which they would kick away his arms so his head hit the pavement. They referred to this as [...] "penance". They also verbally abused him, referring {{to him as a}} [...] "lame darkie". On several occasions they drove him out of Leeds in police vehicles, abandoning him on the outskirts in the early morning. Their intention was to force Oluwale to leave Leeds and not return. However, he viewed Leeds as his home and made his way back each time.|$|E
60|$|The most {{trustworthy}} tradition avers, however, {{that only}} one man, a person named Babbitt, survived the massacre, and he was desperately wounded. He dragged himself on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> (for one leg was broken) to a station several miles away. He did it during portions of two nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and bodily pain. The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained, including {{quite an amount of}} treasure.|$|R
60|$|The wizard tried, {{and found}} that he could creep on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> one <b>knee,</b> {{dragging}} the wounded limb on the ice. It gave him excruciating pain, {{but he was too}} much of a man to mind that. In a few minutes he was lying at full length on the sledge.|$|R
60|$|The {{superintendent}} {{went down}} instantly on <b>his</b> own <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> pulled up {{every piece of}} the cocoa-nut matting with minute deliberation, searched the whole place thoroughly from end to end, but found nothing. He spent nearly an hour on that thorough search; meanwhile Mactavish never for a moment relaxed his hold upon me.|$|R
2500|$|Marcia Wallace {{spoke of}} Newhart's amiable nature on set: [...] "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I {{had a dog}} {{by the name of}} Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And {{whenever}} there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... said Kennedy, [...] "one {{night before}} a big Minnesota game-it {{was for the}} {{national}} championship-Bob had an attack,and they wouldn't let him into health services-he didn't have the right cards or something like that. He had to crawl home on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> that night, but he played the next day." [...] Westfall was the first Ann Arbor High School graduate {{to play for the}} Wolverines since Hall of Famer John Maulbetsch in 1916. [...] He was the starting fullback in every Michigan football game from 1939–1941. [...] In his sophomore and junior years, he played in a backfield that also included Tom Harmon and Forest Evashevski. Westfall rushed for 1,864 yards on 428 carries (4.36 yards per carry) in 24 games (Michigan only played 8 games per season then and freshmen were not eligible for varsity play). [...] This stood as a Michigan fullback career rushing record for 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with a tiny bit of water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E
6000|$|Even {{my father}} and mother were able to take it lightly with plenty of {{laughter}} and no groaning that I ever heard. For over all lay the morning light of hope, and what prisoner, escaping from his dungeon, ever stayed to think of <b>his</b> torn <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> when beyond the distant opening he could see the sunlight glinting through the brambles? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Sir,' said Mr Perch, {{coughing}} another cough behind <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{which was}} always his resource {{as an expression}} of humility when nothing else occurred to him, 'his observation generally air that he would humbly wish to see one of the gentlemen, and that he wants to earn a living. But you see, Sir,' added Perch, dropping his voice to a whisper, and turning, in the inviolable nature of his confidence, to give the door a thrust with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee,</b> as if that would shut it any more when it was shut already, 'it's hardly to be bore, Sir, that a common lad like that should come a prowling here, and saying that his mother nursed our House's young gentleman, and that he hopes our House will give him a chance on that account. I am sure, Sir,' observed Mr Perch, 'that although Mrs Perch was at that time nursing as thriving a little girl, Sir, as we've ever took the liberty of adding to our family, I wouldn't have made so free as drop a hint of her being capable of imparting nourishment, not if it was never so!' ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was assassinated}} by four gunmen, {{all members of}} the Forqan group, in front of the Theology Department of Tehran University, on 18December 1979. He was shot four times, with the bullets going through <b>his</b> head, shoulder, <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> The day of his {{assassination}} is called the day for [...] "unity among seminaries and universities".|$|R
2500|$|The allusion is to Proverbs 23:31: [...] "Look not thou {{upon the}} wine {{when it is}} red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.". On 12 May 1901, {{he was part of}} a {{reconnaissance}} squad patrolling in the location of the Toorberg Mountain above the Doornbosch Farm when they came across and engaged a group of Boers. In the ensuing battle, Moore's horse was shot out from underneath him, and he took cover behind the body of the fallen horse. He was then seriously wounded when a Boer bullet hit him in the waist, having passed through the body of the dead horse. Moore eventually killed his Boer opponent after eight shots, and had struggled back to a ridge and was crawling along it on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> when his mates found him. They took the gravely wounded Moore to the nearby Kwaggashoek Farmhouse. He died of his wounds that night; a contemporary South Melbourne newspaper claimed that Moore [...] "was the first man of the Imperial Contingent to die of gunshot wounds".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 April, Miss Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for {{the safety}} of her pupils, {{was on her way to}} shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian {{children}} home. While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. [...] She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: [...] "Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too." [...] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Miss Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him [...] "as the 'saviour' of the Punjab".|$|E
2500|$|The outcry was instantaneous. The word [...] "grovel" [...] had {{sinister}} connotations for West Indian people, many of {{whom have}} slave ancestry. Moreover, apartheid and the Gleneagles Agreement were prominent issues of the day, so a white South African using the word [...] "grovel" [...] heavily accentuated the faux pas. The West Indian fast bowlers took great delight in adding yards to their run-up when Greig came to the wicket and their supporters took equal delight when his wicket was captured. At times during the series, the West Indies were roundly criticised for their use of short-pitched bowling. To compensate for his unusual height and attempt to combat such bowling, Greig held the bat at shoulder height (rather than leave it on the ground) as the bowler ran in, thus not using a back swing of the bat. While it helped him to combat the short ball, it left him vulnerable to the yorker (full pitch) and he was bowled quite regularly for a top order batsman. The West Indian bowlers managed to hit Greig's stumps often. Apart from a formidable performance in the fourth Test at Leeds, where he fought back with 116 and 76 not out and shared a big partnership with keeper Alan Knott, Greig scored just 51 runs in seven innings. Worse, his bowling lost penetration and he took only five wickets as England slumped to a 0–3 loss. However, Greig did not lose his sense of humour: playing on his [...] "grovel" [...] comment, he pretended to crawl on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> in front of the open stands on the Harleyford Road side of The Oval in the last Test match, delighting the crowds that had previously jeered him.|$|E
50|$|In August 2007 Quinnell {{was treated}} for serious {{injuries}} after slipping whilst entering a shower and falling through a glass shower door at his then home near Llanelli. He was taken to West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen with a severed right triceps and glass embedded in <b>his</b> right arm, <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee.</b> Quinnell's godfather was Welsh rugby legend Mervyn Davies.|$|R
60|$|One man peering from {{a bedroom}} window saw his face, saw him staring, with a grimace of weeping dismay, {{at the blood}} upon <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> bent under him, and he came {{crashing}} to the earth, {{the first of the}} giant nettles to fall to Caterham's resolute clutch, the very last that he had reckoned would come into <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{our hero}} {{found himself in}} a hole, pitch dark and barely large enough to permit of <b>his</b> {{creeping}} on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> he felt a sudden sensation of fear--of undefinable dread--come over him, such as one might be supposed to experience on awaking to the discovery that he had been buried alive. His first impulse was to shout for deliverance, but his manhood returned to him, and he restrained himself.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the detective}} dropped to <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> Jet {{following}} his example.|$|E
60|$|Harvey {{opened the}} door softly, dropped to <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and crawled into the yard.|$|E
60|$|Dismounting, he {{got down}} upon <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and {{examined}} the last hoof-prints with extreme care.|$|E
60|$|There {{could be}} no further doubt now {{about the nature of}} the fight. Catching up a spear from the bundle at his feet he was just in time to receive the Eskimo, who sprang in on him with the {{intention}} of coming at once to close quarters. His rush was very furious; probably with a view to make it decisive. But the agile Leo was equal to the occasion. Bending suddenly so low as to be quite under his opponent's desperate thrust, he struck out his right leg firmly. Koyatuk tripped over it, and ploughed the land for some yards with <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{cardinal}} bowed stiffly, {{resentful of}} this reception. In his long journey across the Spains, princes and nobles had flocked to kiss <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> bend the <b>knee</b> before him, seeking his blessing. Yet this mere boy, beardless {{save for a}} silky down about his firm young cheeks, retained his seat and greeted him with no more submissiveness than {{if he had been}} the envoy of some temporal prince.|$|R
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} the end came, as swiftly and unexpectedly as the thing had begun. His wild swings had tired Bugs Butler, and with fatigue prudence returned to him. His feet began once more their subtle weaving in and out. Twice <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> flickered home. A quick feint, a short, jolting stab, and Ginger's guard was {{down and he}} was swaying {{in the middle of}} the ring, <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> hanging <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> a-quiver.|$|R
