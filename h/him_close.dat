5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep <b>him</b> <b>close</b> at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E

Unexpectedly, Carneiro Leão decided to take Paranhos as his secretary, passing over the more experienced members of Brazil's diplomatic corps. On 23 October 1851, both departed for Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.|$|E

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, {{where he}} was a student in the years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied {{theology}} and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to join the ranks of clergy, but he refused to follow this path. After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought <b>him</b> <b>close</b> to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, it is {{revealed}} that as children Tifa and Cloud {{had decided to}} follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa {{was in a coma}} for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's SOLDIER program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed that he did it primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she was ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, after Sephiroth destroyed the town of Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor Zangan, eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home.

5|$|In the 1910–11 Australian season, Crawford {{scored a}} half-century in every {{first-class}} game he played but was less successful with the ball. His success against the touring South Africans, perhaps helped by his experience facing their googly bowlers on previous occasions, brought <b>him</b> <b>close</b> to selection for the Australian Test team that year. The Australian Board of Control eventually decided that, {{as he had}} already appeared for England, they could not choose him; instead they picked Charlie Kelleway as the all-rounder. Crawford resigned from his position as St Peter's in March 1911, suggesting to the press that he might move into farming. He may have considered leaving South Australia, but the Cricket Association appointed him as a clerk at the Adelaide Oval, a position which earned £200 per annum, with additional responsibility for coaching and youth scouting. Meanwhile, in England, after unsuccessful attempts by his father to change {{the mind of the}} Surrey committee, including a failed bid to secure his own election to the committee, Crawford sent a written apology to Surrey at some time in 1910. Consequently, the committee passed a motion in March 1911 which ended the ban on Crawford playing for the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw <b>him</b> <b>close</b> up to him under the safety car.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his cricket career, {{which lasted}} from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close {{was one of}} the most charismatic and {{well-known}} cricketers. He scored almost 35,000runs as a batsman, including 52centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168wickets as a bowler, over 800catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit <b>him.</b> <b>Close</b> was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.|$|E

Millet (himself one of Taft's circle) asked Taft to give him a leave of absence to recuperate before the presidential primaries began. Taft agreed and ordered Butt to go on vacation. Butt left on a six-week vacation to Europe on March 1, 1912, accompanied by Millet. Butt booked passage on the RMS Titanic for his return to the United States. He boarded the Titanic on April 10, 1912; Millet boarded the ship at Cherbourg, France, later that same day. Butt and Millet were playing cards on the night of April 14 in the first-class smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg.

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark {{has a responsibility to}} use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice.

Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman.

25|$|Howard {{reported}} to camp {{for his second}} NBA season having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season. Orlando coach Brian Hill—responsible for grooming former Magic superstar Shaquille O'Neal—decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center. Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up game, and his defense. He exerted extra pressure on Howard, saying that the Magic would need him to emerge as a force in the middle before the team had a chance at the playoffs. Even though the big man played tentatively at times, {{he was able to}} build on his strong rookie year with an impressive sophomore season. On November 15, 2005, in a home game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Howard scored 21 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to score 20 or more points and gather 20 or more rebounds in the same game. He was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the 2006 Rookie Challenge during the All-Star break, and on April 15, 2006, he recorded a career-high 26 rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers; his 28 points in that game also brought <b>him</b> <b>close</b> to an NBA rarity, a 30–30 game. Overall, he averaged 15.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, ranking second in the NBA in rebounds per game, offensive rebounds, and double doubles; and sixth in field goal percentage. Despite Howard's improvement, the Magic finished the season with a 36–46 win-loss record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive season since Howard's arrival.|$|E
