30|$|In {{addition}} to access efficiency, power conservation {{is critical for}} mobile nodes owing to limited battery capacities [17 – 19]. To facilitate power saving, {{it is necessary for}} mobile devices to support two operation modes: the active mode and the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> [20]. Mobile clients normally operate in the active mode, and they can switch to the energy-saving <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> when mobile devices become idle. Thus, keeping mobile devices in the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> {{for as long as possible}} could be achieved through the application of an air index technique.|$|E
30|$|In the {{wireless}} data broadcast system, the server repeatedly broadcasts {{data to the}} client, while the mobile client tunes the broadcast channel {{to search for the}} air data, process, and query the data on the local terminal. The broadcast access efficiency and energy consumption are two critical parameters to measure the performance of the client. In order to reduce energy consumption, the mobile device generally has two working modes—i.e., the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> and the active mode—while the energy consumption in <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> is significantly lower than that in active mode. When the device does not need to received data and is in the <b>doze</b> <b>mode,</b> it can significantly reduce the energy consumption. The access latency and tuning time are the main performance indicators of wireless broadcast system [6, 7].|$|E

If external RAM is present, the model has the ability to shutdown the RAM when in low-power mode. An enhancement could be to include OS task scheduling activity for applying DVFS.|$|R

As the access part consumes a major fraction of the energy consumption in today's fiber-to-the-home-based telecommunication networks, the energy efficiency of NGOA networks should be an important design parameter. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of the energy consumption in different NGOA technologies. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of (1) introducing low power modes (e. g., sleep and <b>doze</b> <b>modes)</b> in the various NGOA technologies and (2) using optimal split ratios adjusted to the traffic demands so that the energy consumption is optimized for the desired quality of service level...|$|R

30|$|In 802.11 WLANs, devices can be {{deployed}} in ad hoc mode, where devices {{can communicate with}} each other without a base station. Also, in order for power conservation, 802.11 MAC (media access control) provides a PSM (power saving mechanism), by which the devices can turn off their radios and stay in <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> for power saving after a certain period of idle state [8]. The devices can buffer traffic for a certain period if the destination devices stay in <b>doze</b> <b>mode,</b> and during ATIM (announcement traffic indication message) window, all the devices become active for ATIM frame transmissions. When the ATIM window terminates, the devices having received or successfully transmitted an ATIM frame keep awake in the remaining BI (beacon interval) for data transmissions, while others enter into doze for power conservation.|$|E

At present, several research efforts have addressed reducing the initial probe time [15, 21 – 26]. These studies complement our work in different aspects.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the traffic over the Internet is TCP based, which is very sensitive to packet loss and delay. Existing research efforts in TDM-Passive Optical Networks (TDM-PONs) mostly evaluate energy saving and traffic delay performances under different energy saving solutions. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, how energy saving mechanisms could affect TCP traffic performance in TDM-PONs has hardly been studied. In this paper, by means of our state-of-art OPNET Modular based TDM-PON simulator, we evaluate TCP traffic delay, throughput, and Optical Network Unit (ONU) energy consumption performances in a TDM-PON where energy saving mechanisms are employed in ONUs. Here, we study the performances under commonly used energy saving mechanisms defined in standards for TDM-PONs: cyclic sleep and <b>doze</b> <b>mode.</b> In cyclic sleep mode, we evaluate the performances under two well-known sleep interval length deciding algorithms (i. e. fixed sleep interval (FSI) and exponential sleep interval deciding (ESID)) that an OLT uses to decide sleep interval lengths for an ONU. Findings in this paper put forward the strong relationship among TCP traffic delay, throughput and ONU energy consumption under different sleep interval lengths. Moreover, we reveal that under high TCP traffic, both FSI and ESID will end up showing similar delay, energy and throughput performance. Our findings also show that <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> can offer better TCP throughput and delay performance at the price of consuming more energy than cyclic sleep mode. In addition, our results provide a glimpse on understanding at what point <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> becomes futile in improving energy saving of an ONU under TCP traffic. Furthermore, in this paper, we highlight important research issues that should be studied in future research to maximize energy saving in TDM-PONs while meeting traffic Quality of Service requirements...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a sleep mode interval control algorithm that considers downlink trafc pattern and terminal mobility to maximize energy-efciency. Through simulations, we show that our proposed algorithm improves energy saving and delay performance.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, when a user submits queries to a mobile client, the mobile {{equipment}} first fetches an index packet from the index channel {{to get the}} arrival time of the target data. Then the mobile device switches from the active mode to the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> for energy savings until the target item appears on the data channel [20]. After that, the mobile client downloads the target data transaction so as to process the user's request.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the power efficiency, 802.11 MAC has {{proposed}} a PSM to allow devices without data for transmission {{to enter into the}} <b>doze</b> <b>mode,</b> where quite less power is consumed. In ad hoc mode, the 802.11 PSM works in a distributed fashion. Devices autonomously construct an IBSS (independent basic service set), and the time is divided into BIs (beacon intervals). All the devices belonging to the same IBSS are timely synchronized and share the same BI and TBTTs (target beacon transmission times). During a BI, when the TBTT starts, devices contend to deliver a beacon frame, and if one device successfully delivers a beacon, then other devices cancel the pending beacon transmissions and adjust their clocks in accordance with the time stamp stored in the beacon. Following the TBTT, an ATIM window is initiated, during which all devices stay in active, and those devices that have data frames buffered for others contend to transmit ATIM frames. When the ATIM window terminates, only the devices that have successfully transmitted or received ATIM frames keep active for data transmissions, and other devices can enter into <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> until next BI.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The stupendous {{growth in}} {{wireless}} and mobile devices {{in the recent}} years has prompted researchers to look at innovative approaches that enable effective use of the available resources. In this thesis, we propose a medium access control (MAC) protocol, referred to as EM-MAC, that enables wireless devices with multi-channel access capabilities while minimizing energy consumption. EM-MAC relies on iMAC's efficient channel selection mechanism to resolve the medium contention on the common control channel, and to select the best available data channel for data communication. Our protocol saves energy by allowing devices that have not gained access to the medium to switch to <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> until the channel becomes idle again. The pair of devices that gains access to the data channel reserves and uses the channel {{until the end of the}} reservation period. At the end of each reservation period, devices belonging to a given data channel contend again for the medium, and only the pair of devices that wins access to the medium is allowed to communicate on the channel while all other devices switch to <b>doze</b> <b>mode.</b> Using simulations, we show that EM-MAC yields substantial energy savings when compared with iMAC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{achieve a}} long {{run-time}} for battery-operated {{portable electronic devices}} that incorporate wireless transceivers, efficient power management of the radio is a critical requirement. The power management function of IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) allows stations (STAs) {{to operate in the}} <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> so that their power consumption is significantly reduced. Hence, efficient algorithms to manage when and how often a STA enters and exits <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> are crucial to batteryoperated STAs. We address this problem by developing a novel model for stochastic analysis of timer-based power management in infrastructure IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. Based on this model, the probabilities that a STA is active, idle, or dozing are derived, and the power consumption of the STA, number of frames buffered, and average delay per frame are obtained. These results enable an efficient power management algorithm that optimizes the idle timer and doze duration at the STA and the frame buffer at the access point. Moreover, similar statistics for the basic power management method in the IEEE 802. 11 standard are derived as a special case of the proposed timer-based power management scheme. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Index Terms—Power management, WLAN, IEEE 802. 11, power saving...|$|E
30|$|C= 1 completes its backoff {{procedure}} {{and starts to}} transmit data. If several frames are buffered, the device can continually occupy the channel by setting the More Data field of the ongoing frame as 1, and the duration field as {{the period of time}} for current transmission plus one more transmission. After the device delivered all the buffered frames, the device itself and the destination device should confirm whether they have received ATIM frames from each other. If they have received the frames, those devices should stay active continually; otherwise, they enter into <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> immediately.|$|E
30|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for improving the power efficiency of wireless devices. Vukadinovic et al. [7] present a traffic announcement solution to enhance the 802.11 PSM for multi-hop ad hoc networks. Because when a data frame is forwarded over multiple hops, only the next hop device is notified about the pending frame, devices on other hops may stay in <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> and thus causes quite a long end-to-end delay. Proposed scheme enables each device along the routing path to send a traffic announcement to its downstream neighbor in advance. As a result, the data frames can be forwarded over multiple hops in a single beacon interval, and the end-to-end delay in the multi-hop transmission is decreased efficiently.|$|E
30|$|In [13] a power-saving {{protocol}} for reducing power, consumption of APs is presented. This approach allows AP {{to enter into}} <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> when it has no traffic for transmission {{during a period of}} time. Devices can convey wake-up signals to AP by the equipped wake-up transceivers. This approach decreases the power consumption of APs by decreasing the time spent in idle state. These approaches mentioned above, however, cannot be adopted for IoT communication effectively; [12] focuses on enabling the implemented wireless interfaces to work adaptively, while power efficiency for each wireless interface is still unsolved. Also, [13] requires new radios to be equipped with devices, and additional solutions for managing the operation of the radios are also needed.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} better {{illustrate}} the concept of DIM index, we will provide an example. In the first case, assume we need to query the 16 th frame (1, 8, 9). First of all, we search for the prime index in Name Node, obtain the 16 th frame, and store it in DN 2, so the mobile client switches to the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> until the broadcast data {{is sent to the}} 8 th frame in the frame sequence of DN 2 to start tuning in. In the second case, assume the current frame is the 5 th frame in DN 1 (0, 4, 5), and we need to query the 16 th frame (1, 8, 9). Then, by querying the index of (0, 4, 5) frame, we obtain the quintuple group parameters: the Node No. is DN 1, the NPCN is 2, the SVFF is 0, the DCFFF is 3, and the DCSP is 2. Then, we can find out that the frame that needs to be queried can only be obtained after 11 frames since the current frame, and then the mobile client will enter the <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> until the frame of (1, 8, 9). In this distributed index structure, we do not need to frequently switch between multiple frames, the query performance is improved, and it can also provide minimum access latency and tuning time. In this example, in the first case, we can immediately obtain the sequence of target frame through the query index, so the tuning time is 1 frame (not including the query prime index), and the access time is 16 frames; in the second case, the tuning time is 2 frames, and the access time is 12 frames.|$|E
30|$|Lin et al. [14] {{point out}} that in {{infrastructure}} mode, wireless devices waste their powers on idle state, as the devices should continually sense channel and overhear the ongoing transmissions of the other devices. Also, the contentions among devices waking {{up at the same}} moment for traffic retrieval can cause power waste. The authors provide a DeepSleep scheme to enhance the 802.11 PSM for energy-harvesting devices, where the devices short of power can enter into <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> for a long period and then access the channel with a higher priority. In order to avoid a large number of devices waking up at the same moment, a random deferring algorithm is applied to randomly defer the wake up time of devices, which can alleviate the channel contentions among devices.|$|E
30|$|Due to its {{low cost}} and popularity, the IEEE 802.11 WLAN (wireless local area network) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising wireless technologies for IoT (Internet of Things). 802.11 WLAN also provides a PSM (power saving mechanism), by which the devices that have no data to transmit are enabled to turn into <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> where much less power is consumed. However, the 802.11 PSM is known to be inefficient because of its contention-based mechanism, i.e., it suffers from the performance degradation due to hidden terminals, especially in a network with a large number of devices. In this paper, in order to improve the performance of the 802.11 PSM, we propose a BC (backoff counter) reservation scheme that is combined with a neighbor polling solution. By building analytic models and performing extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme provides a much improved performance.|$|E

However, it is not energy efficient for wireless mobile equipments to use data broadcast if the receivers have to stay awake while waiting for a desired data item without knowing when it {{will appear on the}} air. For this reason, some indexing schemes are designed that allow a wireless client retrieves a pointer to the required data item on air first. Thereafter, the client can go to <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> until the required data item appears on the channel. Performance results show indexing schemes can reduce energy consumption tremendously. Meanwhile, these schemes do not support concurrency when an application involves wireless mobile clients that run multiple-operation transactions and dynamically update the server database.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the area}} of {{wireless}} mobile communication, minimizing energy consumption as well as maximizing data throughput in medium access control (MAC) layer {{is a very important}} research issue. The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) of IEEE 802. 11 provides the power saving mechanism (PSM) that allows nodes to remain silent in ‘doze mode ’ for reducing energy consumption. However, IEEE 802. 11 PSM is known to cause unnecessary energy consumption due to the problems of an overhearing, a back-off time delay and possible packet collisions. To overcome these problems, we present a new MAC protocol called ‘Slotted-PSM ’ for IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. In our proposed scheme, the Beyond-ATIM window is divided into a number of time slots, and any node that participates in communication wakes up in its slot times only and other nodes can enter to <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> during the slot times. Slotted-PSM can reduce unnecessary energy consumption and idle listening problem in the Beyond-ATIM window. ...|$|E
30|$|According to Fig.  8 a–h, we can {{see that}} with the {{increase}} of target density, ISW has poor fitness and the access latency and tuning time present the trend of increase. The DIM, NPI, and IEI have stable performance, especially the DIM index method proposed in this paper, and its tuning time and access latency are only 1 / 3 of that of NPI method and 1 / 2 of that of IEI method. Especially on the large dataset FL, both the IEI and NPI methods present certain fluctuations, while the DIM method maintains great stability. The increase of object density has resulted in the expansion of broadcast cycle, so the tuning time of ISW index method would increase rapidly. Our DIM method can quickly localize the data that needs to be queried based on the prime index or the parameter in frame index; it does not need to monitor other frames, and these frames are in the <b>doze</b> <b>mode,</b> which can significantly reduce the overhead.|$|E

In particular the mode selection is not only based on Qlow and Qhigh traffic conditions, representing the absence or presence of traffic. Dense mode selection thresholds are applied instead that grate queue traffic providing fine switching between cyclic sleep and doze.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{wireless}} ad hoc network, utilizing the multiple channels at Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is on {{of the key}} techniques to improve the network performance. It {{can be done by}} multi-channel MAC to utilize the channels resource as much as possible. Wireless nodes are usually powered by battery and thus are limited in power capacity. The IEEE 802. 11 Power Saving Mechanism (PSM) is used to conserve energy for the ad hoc networks by allowing nodes to enter <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> when {{there is no need for}} data exchange. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and adaptive protocol, named H-MMAC, by adopting IEEE 802. 11 PSM. In H-MMAC, nodes exchange control messages on default channel to negotiate the data channel during the ATIM (Ad hoc traffic Indication Message) window. The difference of H-MMAC compared to other multi-channel MAC protocols is that the other nodes can transmit data packets on data channels based on the network traffic load. This means H-MMAC can utilize the channel resources more efficiently. The simulation results show that our proposed H-MMAC improves the network performance significantly in terms of aggregate throughput, average delay and energy efficiency.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a TDMA based energy efficient cognitive radio multichannel {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol called ECR-MAC for wireless ad hoc networks. ECR-MAC requires only a single half-duplex radio transceiver on each node that integrates the spectrum sensing at physical (PHY) layer and the packet scheduling at MAC layer. In addition to explicit frequency negotiation which is adopted by conventional multichannel MAC protocols, ECR-MAC introduces lightweight explicit time negotiation. This two-dimensional negotiation enables ECR-MAC to exploit the advantage of both multiple channels and TDMA, and achieve aggressive power savings by allowing nodes that {{are not involved in}} communication to go into <b>doze</b> <b>mode.</b> The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows for the use of multiple channels available at the PHY layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multichannel environment, because of the multichannel hidden terminal problem. The proposed energy efficient ECR-MAC protocol allows secondary users (SUs) to identify and use the unused frequency spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary users (PUs). Extensive simulation results show that our proposed ECR-MAC protocol successfully exploits multiple channels and significantly improves network performance by using the licensed spectrum band opportunistically and protects QoS provisioning over cognitive radio ad hoc networks...|$|E

In minimum-process coordinated checkpointing, some processes may not checkpoint for several checkpoint initiations. In {{the case of a}} recovery after a fault, such processes may rollback to far earlier checkpointed state and thus may cause greater loss of computation. In all-process coordinated checkpointing, the recovery line is advanced for all processes but the checkpointing overhead may be exceedingly high. To optimize both matrices, the checkpointing overhead and the loss of computation on recovery, we propose a hybrid checkpointing algorithm, wherein an all-process coordinated checkpoint is taken after the execution of minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for a fixed number of times. Thus, the Mobile nodes with low activity or in <b>doze</b> <b>mode</b> operation may not be disturbed in the case of minimum-process checkpointing and the recovery line is advanced for each process after an all-process checkpoint. Additionally, we try to minimize the information piggybacked onto each computation message. For minimum-process checkpointing, we design a blocking algorithm, where no useless checkpoints are taken and an effort has been made to optimize the blocking of processes. We propose to delay selective messages at the receiver end. By doing so, processes are allowed to perform their normal computation, send messages and partially receive them during their blocking period.

In an infrastructure WLAN, a STA cannot be connected until it is associated with an access point (AP), {{which is responsible for}} buffering frames for all the associated STAs operating in the power saving mode. Hence, efficient memory utilization is critical for an AP to accommodate as many powersaving STAs as possible. The basic power management (BPM) scheme introduced in the IEEE 802. 11 standard achieves power saving by allowing STAs not engaging in data delivery to operate in <b>doze</b> <b>mode,</b> but it does not consider the efficient use of the memory in the AP. To tradeoff power consumption for memory usage, we present an AP-priority timer-based power management (APP-TPM) scheme and develop a novel model for stochastic analysis of the proposed scheme. Based on this model, the probability distributions of the numbers of frames buffered at the AP and the average numbers of frames buffered at the AP are obtained. Moreover, a power-aware buffer management scheme (PBMS), which is based on the derived statistics, is proposed to accommodate as many STAs as possible given a fixed amount of memory in the AP while maintaining low power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than BPM in terms of memory usage in the AP. Index Terms—Power management, WLAN, IEEE 802. 11, power saving...|$|E

In this paper, we design a minimum process algorithm for Mobile Distributed systems, where no useless checkpoints are taken and an effort {{has been made to}} optimize the blocking of processes. We propose to delay the processing of selective messages at the receiver end only during the checkpointing period. A Process is allowed to perform its normal computations and send messages during its blocking period. In this way, we try to keep blocking of processes to bare minimum.

In coordinated checkpointing, if asingle process fails to take its checkpoint; all the checkpointing effort goes waste, because, each process has to abort its tentative checkpoint. In order to take its tentative checkpoint, an MH needs to transfer large checkpoint data to its local MSS over wireless channels.
