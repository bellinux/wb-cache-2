40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{has emerged as a}} possible contender {{for the next generation of}} digital <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> and as the fundamental transport basis for the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network, (B-ISDN) and telecommunications in the future. ATM networks can provide a high degree of flexibility. Due to the dynamic allocation of transmission and switching resources and the absence of a physical channel structure in such a network, services are not necessarily restricted to a particular bit rate. They may work at any bit rate within the limit of the network and can also support variable bit rate connections. There is a growing need for networks to carry a greater range of traffic such as wide-band traffic (video), bursty traffic (variable bit rate video), short holding time traffic (facsimile) and low bandwidth traffic (voice). To cope with variations in demand, networks must also be capable of dynamically allocating their total capacity amongst the various traffic types. The traffic requirements can be met through the use of architectures based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) [...] cont'...|$|R

Unlike the case {{of many of the}} collaborative arrangements between established firms in the US, Europe or Japan, where mutual risk reduction is frequently the driving influence, in the case of Taiwan it is technological learning, upgrading and catch-up industry creation that is the object of the collaborative exercises. The Taiwan R&D alliances were formed hesitantly in the 1980 s, but have flourished in the 1990 s as institutional forms have been found which encourage firms to cooperate in raising their technological levels. Most of these alliances are in the information technology sectors, covering personal computers, work stations, servers and multimedia, as well as a range of consumer products and telecommunications and <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> and products. But they have also emerged in other sectors such as automotive engines, motor cycles, electric vehicles, and in the services and financial sector as well. Several such alliances could be counted in Taiwan in the late- 1990 s, bringing together firms, and public sector research institutes, with the added organizational input of trade associations, and catalytic financial assistance from government. The paper discusses the evolving organizational architecture of these R&D alliances, utilizing several case studies, and seeks to draw comparisons between these institutional innovations in Taiwan and established collaborative arrangements in the USA, Japan and Europe...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) is {{a digital}} {{communication}} system that provides advanced voice networking capabilities to the Edwards Test Range. The EDS {{is a member}} of a new family of all-digital <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> that internally handle data in digital form. To accommodate analog voice and data circuits, conversions between analog and digital formats occur at the system interfaces. The EDS consists of six groups of configuration items: System-level control and monitoring is centralized in the Control and Display Subsystem. Workstations provide subsystem-level control and monitoring. The Central Switching Subsystem, as the primary interface with the range environment, provides system connectivity to radios, telephone circuits, and communications links to other facilities. It integrates the EDS with links to the Control Room Switching Subsystems. Each Control Room Switching Subsystem connects individual user stations within a Mission Control Room or other localized area. The user equipment element consists of a Subscriber Terminal Unit, Channel Expander, and interface panels for headsets, foot switches, and speakers. The Remote Radio Control Unit optimizes usage of available frequencies, allowing control of tunable radios from the Control and Display Subsystem. *The original name, Edwards Communication <b>Switching</b> <b>System</b> (ECSS) was changed to Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) in 1990. The Site Selection Unit facilitates the handover of voice communications between receiver sites when a long-range test is monitored. The system architecture is based on a central system-level control element, a central switch, multiple subsystem-level control elements, multiple subsystem switches, and end-equipment items that are interconnected through the switch network. The EDS combines multiple voice communications applications in a single system. The system is being expanded to integrate voice and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> Its major function is support of multiparty networked voice communications within Mission Control Rooms and between other test participants. Other voice functions are an intercom capability including both Direct Access (hot line) and Indirect Access (dial-up), subscriber loop connections to the base-level telephone exchange, and the Public <b>Switched</b> Network <b>System.</b> Digital interfaces allow integration of ciphertext data and Time Space Position Information <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> functions. A <b>system</b> based on the EDS design has also been installed by the Air Force at Eglin AFB. Engineering studies for systems that make use of the EDS design are currently underway by the Navy at China Lake and the Army at White Sands Missile Range. The EDS project office has actively pursued promising program management concepts such as: specifying nondevelopmental items, requiring industry standard interconnectivity and interoperability, and using a multiyear fixed-price requirements-type contract to encourage multiservice participation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer.

30|$|A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{a hybrid}} {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of a}} finite number of subsystems and a logical rule that manages switching between these subsystems. <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> have drawn {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years; see [1 – 37] and references therein. The motivation for studying <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> comes partly from the fact that <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>switched</b> multicontroller <b>systems</b> have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, process control, automotive industry, power systems, aircraft and traffic control, and many other fields. An important qualitative property of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is stability [1 – 3]. The challenge of analyzing the stability of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> lies partly in the fact that, even if the individual systems are stable, the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> might be unstable. Using a common quadratic Lyapunov function on all subsystems, the quadratic Lyapunov stability facilitates the analysis and synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the obtained results within this framework have been recognized to be conservative. In [10], various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine systems were presented. Different classes of Lyapunov functions were considered, and how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities was also shown. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements was discussed. The problem of stability analysis and control synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> in the discrete-time domain was addressed in [11]. The approach followed in [11] looked at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. These two conditions have been proved to be equivalent for stability analysis.|$|R
