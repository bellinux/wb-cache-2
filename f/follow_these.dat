5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two.

5|$|Arnold {{then led}} {{many of the}} {{remaining}} smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to <b>follow.</b> <b>These</b> boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress. The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found Trumbull, New York, Enterprise, and Revenge, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as Liberty, which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith.

However, she declined to <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, {{just hours}} before Sullivan's arrival, Thompson sent 600 troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Arthur St. Clair toward Trois-Rivières with the goal of {{surprising}} and beating back the small British force believed to be there.

On the night of June 7, Thompson, St. Clair, and about 2,000 men crossed the river, landing at Pointe du Lac, a few miles above Trois-Rivières.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{significant}} Deshashta population {{in the state of}} Karnataka, and here, the sub-classification of Deshastha Brahmins is based on the type of Hindu philosophical system they <b>follow.</b> <b>These</b> are the Deshastha Madhwa Brahmins who follow the teachings of Madhvacharya and the Deshastha Smartha Brahmins who follow the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya. The surnames of these North Kanataka based, Kannada speaking Deshastha Brahmins, can be identical to those of Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmins, for example, they have last names like Kulkarni, Deshpande and Joshi. Intermarriages are allowed between the Karnatak Brahmans and the Deshasthas and so the classification of the Southern India Brahmans into the Maharashtra, the Andhra (Telugu) and the Karnatic are in this respect, more of a provincial or linguistic character than an ethnographic one.|$|E
5|$|To {{mitigate}} this disaffection, Sercey ordered {{two of his}} frigates, Prudente and Forte {{to cruise}} in the Bay of Bengal against British trade during the autumn of 1798. When these ships returned, Sercey had already sailed for the east, leaving instructions for the frigates to <b>follow.</b> <b>These</b> orders were however countermanded by the Governor of Île de France, Malartic, who ordered the frigates seized {{while they were in}} harbour. Although Sercey protested Malartic's actions, the governor issued new orders to the ships: Forte was sent northeast to operate in the Bay of Bengal off Calcutta while Prudente was partially disarmed and sold to a privateering concern to operate against trade as a commercial investment.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> instructions.|$|E

After the Stadtholder, William of Orange, fled to Britain, the Dutch Republic was reconstituted as the Batavian Republic by the revolutionaries In Britain, William issued the Kew Letters instructing his colonial governors to cooperate with British occupation forces. At the urging of Sir Francis Baring, the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas authorised a mission to ensure control of the Cape Colony and eliminate the potential threat it posed to the East Indian trade. The Admiralty sent two battle squadrons to the cape on 3 April, 1795, one under Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone and the other under Commodore John Blankett, carrying a small expeditionary force of 515 soldiers from the 78th Regiment of Foot under Major-General Sir James Henry Craig. A larger force under General Alured Clarke was instructed to <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> squadrons on 15 May with troops and supplies for a longer campaign, with orders to hold at Salvador until requested.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} North Koreans {{launched}} a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. The North Koreans captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} {{to score a}} century in the tournament was Pakistan's Moin-ul-Atiq, who made 105 against Bangladesh in the third edition (1988). In the same match, his team mate Ijaz Ahmed scored 124 not out. India's Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar were the lone centurions of the 1990 and 1995 tournaments, respectively. The 2008 edition saw 13 centuries—the highest for a tournament—while no centuries were made in 1986 and 1988. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya holds the record for most number of centuries, with six, {{followed}} by his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara, who has made four. Virat Kohli (India) and Shoaib Malik (Pakistan) <b>follow</b> <b>these</b> two with three centuries each. Sangakkara's three centuries in the 2008 tournament is a record for a single edition. Pakistani batsman Shahid Afridi made two centuries in the 2010 edition while playing as a captain, {{the most in the}} tournament history. His second century, which came against Bangladesh when he made 124 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, is the fastest in terms of balls faced in Asia cup matches. Kohli's 183 against Pakistan in 2012 is the highest individual score as of 2014. Lahiru Thirimanne's (Sri Lanka) 108 against Pakistan in the final of the 2014 edition is the most recent century.|$|E
