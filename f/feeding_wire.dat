Due to {{the proximity of the}} wire and the equal, but opposite, return current, the magnetic field should decrease sharply with the distance from the railway. In practice, however, the rails may have electric contacts with the ground enabling a current leakage into the Earth. Thus, the return current does not cancel the magnetic effect of the current in the traction wire. Moreover, the leakage current may flow to large distances in the ground.|$|E

30|$|Similarly {{to figure}} 7 of Pirjola et al. (2007), {{we assume that}} there is only one train fed by a current of J 1 = 1000 A from a {{substation}} located at a distance of 3 km south of the train, i.e. L = 3 km. The total leakage current J 0 and the height of the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire</b> h are 20 A and 5 m, respectively. Thus, a constant leakage current density is j = J 0 /L = 6.7 mA/m. For a linearly changing leakage current density, Eq. (5) implies that the constant k equals k = 2 J 0 /L 2 = 0.0044 mA/m 2, so that the leakage current density varies from 13.3 mA/m at the train (x = L) to zero at the substation (x = 0).|$|E

Among other features, the electron beam exhibits high scanning speed, high power output, and beam density. While in laser-based machines the fabrication is working in a stable way, transient physical effects in the electron beam process can be observed, which still restrict process stability. For instance, a high power input of the electron beam can result in sudden scattering of the metal powder.

Also, an original approach to simulate the effect of immersing a cold filler wire in the weld pool is presented. The simulation results reveal two important observations. First, the weld pool depth is locally decreased in the presence of filler metal, which is due to the energy absorption by the cold <b>feeding</b> <b>wire</b> from the hot molten pool.

40|$|Vertical wire feeding with an {{axisymmetric}} multi-laser source (feeding {{the wire}} vertically into the molten pool) has exhibited great advantages over LAM (laser additive manufacturing) with paraxial wire feeding, {{which has an}} anisotropic forming problem in different scanning directions. This paper investigates the forming ability of vertical wire feeding with an axisymmetric multi-laser source, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components.

Most of the grains in the samples are equiaxed grains, and a small amount of short columnar grains exist which are parallel to each other. The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire.</b> The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|E

Wire feeding {{has also been}} used in many laser-cladding and other material-addition applications. Each feeding method has its own advantages and disadvantages: wire feeding laser deposition typically has higher deposition rate and higher material usage rate than the powder feeding deposition process, while powder feeding gives better geometry control. In this study a new approach is investigated by combining wire and powder feeding to achieve higher build rate and higher material usage efficiency while maintaining the geometry accuracy.

As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed was optimized for various welding speeds.
