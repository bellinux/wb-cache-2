5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Like phosphate, {{phosphoryl}} chloride is tetrahedral in shape. It features three P−Cl {{bonds and}} one strong P=O double bond, {{with an estimated}} bond <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> of 533.5kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the double bond form is very dominant (in contrast with POF3). The P=O bond does not utilize the d-orbitals on phosphorus as is commonly described in older textbooks as quantum chemical calculations have shown that d-orbitals {{are not involved in}} main group chemical bonding (see Hypervalent molecule). More modern texts favour a description which involves the donation of the lone pair electrons from oxygen p-orbitals to the antibonding phosphorus-chlorine bonds thus constituting π bonding.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a vibrational energy exceeding the <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy,</b> that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no vibrational levels above the <b>dissociation</b> <b>energy</b> level of the potential well. High-energy photon absorption leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In examining how much vibrational energy a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher electronic level, and whether this vibrational energy could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E

The C–Si bond is somewhat polarised towards carbon due to carbon's greater electronegativity (C 2.55 vs Si 1.90). The Si–C bond {{can be broken}} more readily than typical C–C bonds.
