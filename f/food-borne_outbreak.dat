40|$|Background: Salmonella {{is one of}} the {{principal}} causes of food-borne diseases transmitted {{all over the world and}} in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, this microorganism has been identified as {{the principal}} agent of <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in the last years. The objective of this study was to characterize Salmonella enteritidis strains involved in <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreaks</b> usingantimicrobial resistance and rapid genotyping methods. Methodology: Strains of Salmonella isolated from foods involved in salmonellosis occurring in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the period from 2001 to 2002 were characterized by antimicrobial resistance, PCR-ribotyping and RAPD. Results: Among the 79 S. enteritidis analysed by antibiotic resistance, 62. 1 % were susceptible to all drugs tested. The predominant resistance observed was to nalidixic acid (21. 5 %), gentamicin (12. 7 %), and streptomycin (11. 4 %). Resistance was demonstrated in 30 strains (30. 9 %), which were grouped in 14 different patterns. The strains submitted to PCR-ribotyping were grouped in two profiles (R 1 and R 2). The profile R 1 comprised 92. 4 % of the strains. The same strains were also analyzed by RAPD, making it possible to identify four banding profiles (A to D). The profile A comprised 81 % of the strains, while the profiles B, C, and D comprised 9 %, 5 %, and 5 % of the strains, respectively.

40|$|Background and aims. Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and widely {{distributed}} food-borne diseases. The increasing complexity and globalization of the food industry are causing an increase of some of these large-scale food-borne illnesses, thus there is a need for improvements in public health signal detection and communication streams between laboratories and regulatory agencies. The aim of this study is to show how the early reporting of salmonellosis cases directly from the Laboratory of Microbiology to the Local Health Service Infectious Diseases Office along with the prompt response of the ASL, and the rapid involvement of the Local Veterinary Prevention Department resulted in an improved individuation and investigation of a suspected <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> with anomalous manifestation. Materials and methods. From August to November 2014 the early warning from the Laboratory of Microbiology regarding Salmonella spp. isolates with the identical serogroup and antibiotic resistance phenotype, allowed for prompt identification of a food-borne infection.

40|$|Antibiotic {{susceptibility}} patterns, plasmid profiles, and endonuclease restriction {{analysis of}} plasmid DNA {{were used in}} the investigation of an epidemic of Shigella sonnei infections in Monroe County, New York, in 1988 and 1989. The epidemic peaked during the winter, included the simultaneous transmission of the disease from person to person and from common food sources, and especially affected inhabitants of the poor, inner-city neighborhoods, young children of both sexes, and women. Resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, encoded in a 70 -MDa plasmid, was found in most of the examined isolates. Unexpectedly, isolates from patients involved in a <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> exhibited three different antibiotic susceptibility patterns, suggesting deletion of antibiotic resistance determinants in some strains. Antibiograms clearly separated food-borne outbreak-related and non-foodborne outbreak-related strains, distinguished more strains than did the plasmid profiles, and were useful in tracing the dissemination of individual isolates in the community. Restriction endonuclease analysis substantially increased the discriminatory value of plasmid profiles and validated the antibiogram results. The present study illustrates the complexity of epidemics of S. sonnei infections and shows the value of combining different biological markers in the investigation...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the vehicle, source, and causative agent of a community-wide <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> of gastroenteritis. Methods: We conducted a case–control study.

Controls were age- and gender-matched healthy neighbours of cases. Participants were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. Samples from patients and food were tested at reference laboratories. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate matched odds ratios (mORs) for the association of gastroenteritis with food items consumed. Results: Of the 41 cases enrolled in the study, 61 % were males and the median age was 33 years; cases resided in 12 wards of the City.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent food-borne outbreaks, {{comprehensive}} information concerning the food and circumstances involved in food production and processing is necessary. Since 2005 the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has thus been collecting data on foods that were involved in disease outbreaks. Food-borne outbreaks are suspected in cases of illness {{of two or more}} individuals in connection with the same food. In accordance with the general administrative regulation (AVV) “Zoonosen Lebensmittelkette”, the regional veterinary and food control authorities of all German federal states (Länder) and the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) transfer information regarding the food involved to the BfR after all investigations of a <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> have been completed.

Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis. After several years of an increasing European Union (EU) trend, the human campylobacteriosis notification rate has stabilised. In food and animals no EU trends were observed and the occurrence of Campylobacter continued to be high in broiler meat at EU level. The decreasing EU trend in confirmed human salmonellosis cases observed in recent years continued. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry. In foodstuffs, the reported EU-level Salmonella non-compliance in fresh poultry meat decreased. Human listeriosis increased further, showing an increasing EU trend in 2009 - 2013. In ready-to-eat foods Listeria was seldom detected above the legal safety limit. Also during 2009 - 2013, a decreasing EU trend was observed in confirmed yersiniosis cases.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of gastroenteritis affecting 158 of 219 (72 %) guests and employees {{at a hotel}} is described. Food served at the hotel restaurant {{is believed to have}} been the source of the outbreak and to have been contami-nated by sick employees working in the restaurant. A secondary attack rate of 22 % was seen involving 43 persons in all. In stool specimens from seven of eight patients, Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were detected by electron microscopy. While NLV-specific PCR using primers JV 12 and JV 13 were negative, all specimens examined with primers NVp 69 and NVp 110 were positive. The failure of primers JV 12 and JV 13 was attributed to several mismatches in the JV 12 primer. Genotyping and sequence analysis revealed that all samples had identical sequences and clustered with genogroup I, and the most closely related well-characterized genotype is Desert Shield. This is the first described <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> associated with genogroup I virus in Sweden.

40|$|The use of rRNA gene {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism analysis (ribotyping) to subtype Streptococcus pyogenes strains was investigated. Sixty-eight S. pyogenes strains, including 17 reference strains and 51 isolates from blood, acute or chronic pharyngitis, and food-borne outbreaks, {{were characterized by}} determination of both their rDNA {{restriction fragment}} length polymorphism profiles and their serotypes (T and M). Total DNA was cleaved with five selected restriction enzymes and then probed with a digoxigenin-labeled stretch of 1, 063 bp hybridizing with 16 S rRNA genes. Fifteen and nine distinct patterns were generated with SacI and XhoI, respectively, and five patterns were generated with each of the three additional restriction enzymes. With the combination SacI-XhoI, a total of 21 distinct ribotypes were obtained among the 68 isolates. This number was not increased by the results obtained with the other restriction enzymes. All strains tested were typeable. All isolates from each <b>food-borne</b> <b>outbreak</b> belonged to the same ribotype, and all isolates (pre- and posttreatment) from each child with chronic pharyngitis also belonged to the same ribotype, suggesting antibiotic treatment failures. A discriminatory index was calculated for the 47 isolates which were epidemiologically unrelated, using the Hunter-Gaston formula. This index reached 0. 955 when the combination SacI-XhoI was used, showing the good discriminatory power of this typing method. Therefore, ribotyping proved to be a molecular method of interest to subtype S. pyogenes.
