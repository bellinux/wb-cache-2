5|$|On 5 May, the British {{government}} {{continued to}} state that it would provide only logistical and technical support to UNAMSIL, but was privately exploring its options for a military deployment. The United Kingdom had a greater level of political involvement <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone {{than in any other}} African country and, with the country's stability deteriorating, it was reluctant to see that investment wasted. In addition, an estimated 1,000 entitled personnel were <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone, and the government feared for their safety. Academics have since suggested that the credibility of UNAMSIL and future UN peacekeeping operations would have been at stake had the mission <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone been allowed to fail. The British Armed Forces were not as widely deployed in 2000 as they were to be later in the decade. The British Army had two brigades serving with NATO in the Balkans, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had ongoing commitments to Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, and elsewhere, but the armed forces—particularly units threatened by proposed cuts to the defence budget—were keen to participate in an operation. Senior officers thus advised the government that an operation <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone was feasible. Over the following days, there was debate within the British government as to what the aims of a military deployment to Sierra Leone would be. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advocated a full-scale intervention to assist UNAMSIL, arguing that a non-combatant evacuation operation would not be sufficient and would undermine the UN, but the MoD believed that the armed forces would be unable to sustain a larger-scale operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} was eventually ended by the Lomé Peace Accord, which {{was signed in}} July 1999. The United Nations Observer Mission to Sierra Leone was replaced with the United Nations Mission <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone (UNAMSIL), which included a force of 260 military observers. The observers were unarmed and tasked with monitoring the ceasefire mandated by the Lomé Agreement. The observer force, like UNAMSIL itself, was primarily made up of personnel from other African nations, but the United Kingdom contributed {{a small number of}} officers from the British Army, Royal Marines, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. In addition to the observers <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone, personnel from the Royal Logistic Corps were serving in New York, assisting UNAMSIL with organising air-lifts to bring the mission up to its authorised strength.|$|E

5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone.|$|E
30|$|Cumbres de Gaspar and Sierras Chicas {{were the}} most {{affected}} by fires with 31 % and 25 % of their area effectively subjected to fire, respectively (i.e., some areas burned more than once during the 13 -year time frame of this study) (Table 1). Comparisons between the total burned area and the effective burned area indicates high burning frequencies <b>in</b> <b>Sierras</b> Chicas, Cumbres de Gaspar, and Sierras Grandes, with almost no frequency higher than one <b>in</b> <b>Sierras</b> del Norte (Table 1).|$|R

In early 2007, a California condor laid an egg in Mexico {{for the first time since}} at least the 1930s. The population of the condors has risen due to these wild and also captive nestings.|$|E
5|$|In Westminster, {{the three}} {{government}} departments {{concerned with the}} British role <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone—the MoD, the FCO, and DfID—struggled {{to agree on the}} objectives of the military deployment beyond the evacuation, which led to delays in issuing orders. Richards did not receive precise instructions until after Operation Palliser had commenced, and rules of engagement (ROEs) were not issued {{before the start of the}} operation. Commanders defaulted to the ROEs used in Northern Ireland, their most recent relevant experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone. The government was seeking an exit strategy that would end a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.|$|E

30|$|Although {{forests are}} {{less prone to}} fire, at present only a small {{proportion}} of native forests remain in our study area and other Chaco landscapes. <b>In</b> <b>Sierras</b> Grandes, fires are used to promote grass regrowth and to reduce woodland cover, affecting the distribution of Polylepis australis woodlands (Renison et al. 2006). <b>In</b> <b>Sierras</b> del Norte, fires facilitate the extraction of burned trees for charcoal and wood for fuel, and mountain woodlands are replaced by shrubs (Zak et al. 2004). Even though there is no information about land use in Cumbres de Gaspar, it is possible that fires are used for similar purposes given the dominance of grasslands and shrublands. <b>In</b> <b>Sierras</b> Chicas, fire is the main factor structuring vegetation in the transition zone between forests and grasslands (Giorgis et al. 2013). Moreover, fire activity in this area is related to higher population densities and the burning of waste disposals to reduce trash volumes and pests (Nirich 2000, Arganaraz et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|The first {{recorded}} shipment {{of the beer}} to the United States was in 1817. In 1827, the first official shipment of Guinness on the African continent arrived <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone.

5|$|The last STTT, {{formed around}} 2nd Battalion, The Light Infantry, left Sierra Leone {{at the end}} of September 2001. Approximately 8,500 SLA {{personnel}} were trained by the STTTs, which were replaced by the International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT)—an organisation formed of personnel from countries including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with the UK providing the largest contingent as well as an infantry company for force protection. The STTTs also formed a small special forces unit within the SLA—the Force Reconnaissance Unit (FRU)—to provide a morale boost and to give soldiers something to which they could aspire. Later in 2001, the British Army advised the Sierra Leonean government on a merger of Sierra Leone's armed forces into a unified command, which became the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces in early 2002. In 2008, the permanent British contingent <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone was reduced to 100 personnel. British soldiers remained <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone as of 2013, continuing to form part of the IMATT, whose size has further reduced in accordance with the increased capabilities of the Sierra Leone armed forces.|$|E
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF {{in exchange for}} conflict diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued to be involved <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests {{were made by the}} Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce was {{convinced}} {{of the importance of}} religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.|$|E
5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema.

Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health <b>in</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E

The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. <b>In</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
