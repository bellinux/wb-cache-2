50|$|Poudyal {{played a}} key role (and {{continues}} to play) in the Bagmati River clean -up campaign, that was launched in June 2013. Bagmati River is a major river in the capital, Kathmandu, with great ecological and religious importance. But, due to <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization,</b> pollution and lack of proper planning, the river had almost turned into a sewer. With like-minded individuals and organizations as well as concerned government department and agencies, Poudyal {{played a key}} role in the Campaign. The Campaign has already completed 170 weeks (by August 2016) and has been instrumental in raising public awareness and removing garbage from the holy river, pressing government for sewerage treatment pants, making gardens in the river banks and plantation of trees. With the initiation of Bagmati campaigners Dhobikhola, Bishnumati, Nakkhu, Hanumante river clean up campaigns have been launched and continued. The campaign has reached throughout the nation.|$|E

In order to meet global sustainability targets, rapid urban growth must be channelled into environmentally friendly, sustainable and liveable urban environments. Thus, this special issue focuses on sustainable urban design which plays a key role in creating these urban environments...|$|E
40|$|Changing climate, human {{interventions}} to natural water flow pattern, <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> etc., {{are the reasons}} for intense flood even after development of so many structural measures of overflow control. Kulfo River basin is situated in relatively dry southern area of the Ethiopia and is still under geographical modification with hilly topography and impervious soil texture. The concern of the present research is to simulate flood episode {{in order to develop}} flood management strategies to reduce disaster. The complexicity of natural hydrological phenomenon and dependent random variables can be better expressed considering it as stochastic process. Flood (maximum river flow) forecasting on the Kulfo River with monthly runoff data using stochastic ARIMA, Time Series model was developed for warning purposes. The analysis of seasonally varying time series of discharge data has revealed that a higher order ARIMA model may produce excellent results for three to six months forecast...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Urbanization is an {{inevitable}} phenomena {{for the country}} like Bangladesh. The push and pull factors help to migrate people from rural area to urban area. As a result <b>haphazard</b> and unplanned <b>urbanization</b> create environmental degradation. Survey data reveals that inadequate solid waste disposal services, lack of adequate public water supply, traffic congestion, water logging, air pollution, noise pollution, hill cutting are the main problems in the city area. Concentration of dust as well as SOx, NOx exceeded the allowable limit at the selected points. Groundwater level of Sylhet city has a considerable lowering {{over the last few}} decades. It has lowered from 3380 mm below ground in 1982 to 7880 mm below ground. Sylhet is located in highly seismic risk zone but most of the buildings and other structures in this area are constructed without considering earthquake risk. Environmental degradation index was calculated based on economical condition of the country...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of LIS (Land Information System) {{implies that the}} spatially referenced land data stored in the database should be related to its ground location. In the Indian context of information system for sustainable development, the obvious choice of geographical location is the land parcel available in cadastral records. It is both easily locatable on a map and described in legal records. Such a land information system generated from the cadastral surveys will provide the information base for village level or micro level planning. The LIS will comprise of graphic elements derived from cadastral maps and non-graphic attribute data obtained from cadastral records suitably supplemented with additional information useful for planning purposes. In India, rapid urbanization is resulted due to the unprecedented population growth coupled with unplanned developmental activities. The city of Guwahati in India provides a typical case of <b>haphazard</b> and unplanned <b>urbanization.</b> Due to the unplanned growth of the city both in horizontal and vertical directions, {{there is a need}} for proper planning for the careful handling of this alarming situation. In this study an integrated remote sensing and GIS based methodology is developed and successfully tested by generating an up to date digital database. Finally a Land Information System (LIS) is designed for the city development authorities in web supported format...|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{the green}} belts in the cities as an {{antecedent}} outcome of <b>haphazard</b> and irregular <b>urbanization</b> {{as one of the}} principle factors has a negative bearing on the socio ecological services that nature entails. Our paper represents the conditions under which the contemporary statist conservationist efforts to preserve the urban protected areas (PAs) in India induces a marginal existence and livelihood vulnerability upon the survival of the population residing within these PAs. A recent survey to Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai reflects the ways in which a politics of conservation operates not only in the rural regions but also in cities, in highly inequitable and fabricated ways. This has consequently affected the impoverished, disempowered and impecunious inhabitants who comprise a considerable segment of population in cosmopolitan Mumbai, residing within the PAs. The present article assesses the ways in which in metropolises, PAs by definition determine jurisdictions and exercise rights to exclude the social groups who are marginal and less powerful. This is to preserve a pristine people free aesthetic environment in cities, for which there is an increasing demand from the local elite. The results of the study indicate the socio ecological aspects of the conservation politics in the city of Mumbai. The emergent consequences are in terms of the questions of universal rights to the PAs or reflecting an elitist provision of environmental integrity to the privileged visitors in the city...|$|R
40|$|This article {{tells the}} story of the urban Karura forest in Nairobi in order to explore access to and control of green spaces in an African city at a time of rapid, <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization.</b> Using {{insights}} from critical legal geography, it shows that although in strictly legal terms Karura forest remains properly gazetted public land, it continues to exclude citizens in important ways. This is because of a neoliberal conception of security that has promoted the exercise of significant private power over public space. The article examines the powerful ideas that were deployed to achieve the enclosure of the forest. Ideas of ecological guardianship were mobilized in tandem with arguments that the forest must be made ‘safe and secure’. A number of devices (fences, paths, trails, and signposts) played important property functions. This case study provides important insights into the politics of access to green space and to questions of social justice at a time of rapid urban change, not just in Kenya but more widely...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{fewer people}} die {{as a result}} of fire than other natural disasters, such as earthquake, flood, landslide, etc., the average loss of {{property}} due to fire is high. Kathmandu Metropolitan City is becoming more vulnerable to fire due to <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> and increase in population. To control problems due to fire, systematic studies are necessary, including fire potential mapping and risk assessment. This study applies an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Nepal for generation of fire potential zonation map. The fire potential zonation map is prepared on the basis of available data of land use, fuel stations, and population density. This map shows that 58. 04 % of the study area falls under low fire potential zone, 32. 92 % falls under moderate fire potential zone and 9. 04 % falls under high fire potential zone. The map is also validated through major past fire incidents. The results show that the predicted fire potential zones are found to be in good agreement with past fire incidents, and, hence, the map can be used for future land-use planning...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid rise in the burden of noncommunicable {{diseases}} in low-income countries like Nepal. Political and economical instability leading to internal migration give rise to <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> in Nepal. This, coupled with negative effects of globalization, is largely responsible for changing lifestyle and developing risky behaviour among the urban poor that put them {{at high risk of}} developing noncommunicable diseases. A descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted from September to December 2012 in an urban slum of Kathmandu to explore the prevalence of four major behaviour risk factors namely physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, and tobacco and alcohol use and to measure the burden of obesity and hypertension in the population. We used WHO NCDs Risk Factor steps 1 and 2 questionnaires in all the 689 households of the slum. The major behavioral risk factors for noncommunicable diseases were very common with at least a quarter of the population having the major risk factors. The results may serve to form a framework to future planning, policy-making, implementation, and evaluation of any measures undertaken to reduce these risk factors, especially as the government is planning to unveil the National Urban Health Policy soon...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} {{on the relationship between}} rapid urbanization and socio-ecological problems. The major objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the unplanned and <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> that is giving birth to environmental issues such as; pollution, poor drainage system, poor quality of drinking water and poor hygienic conditions. This research carried out in Multan city, Pakistan through field survey of 200 respondents using multistage sampling technique. Self-administrated questionnaire was used as a tool of data collection and the binary logistic regression was employed for the analysis of the data. The results depict that urbanization is one of the major causes of converging joint family system to the nuclear family system and its changing function as a consequence. It is also a source of reduction of greenery and trees in the city. It is causing problem of poor sanitation system and quality of drinking water. Pollution is another outcome of haphazard and unplanned urbanization. The researcher also found that due to migration from rural to urban areas, the life in the city implicates adversely the quality of life. This study provides better insight on the problems of urbanization in urban areas and will also help policy makers to focus on major areas of improvement such as to check the migration from rural to urban. To enforce the urban laws to reduce the problems of sanitation, check on transport system, quality of drinking water, domestic and industrial waste. The researcher suggests the monitoring of the migration from rural to urban areas through provision of basic facilities in rural areas. On the other hand awareness campaigns and provision of basic facilities to the rural people (educational facilities, health facilities, food and empowerment in basic decision making) can reduce this problem...|$|E
40|$|Termites (Isoptera) {{are among}} the worse insect pests for wooden {{structures}} and their presence may represent a serious threat for cultural heritage, especially in those areas where climate and environmental conditions are favourable to these insects. The Old Continent is increasingly jeopardized by the obnoxious assaults of these insects, due to the high density of housing, to the <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> and globalization, to the novel ecological patterns in use in the bio-masonry and to the antique remnant of mansions and sacred architecture. Presently, sustainable management of termite pests includes the use of preventative measures (eg. application of repellents/antifeedants) {{and the use of}} baits with slow-acting termiticides. The nuts of Butyrospermum parkii (Sapotaceae), tree native to West-Central Africa, are used to produce shea (karité) butter, welcome in the manufacture of cosmetics and food stuff. Aborigens believe that the residue from shea-butter extraction is capable to protect their houses from termites, which are extremely abundant in these regions (1). To verify if these popular beliefs have scientific basis, experiments were performed with European subterranean and drywood termites, respectively Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rhinotermitidae) and Kalotermes flavicollis (Kalotermitidae). Therefore an hydroglyceric extract of shea nut shells (the only pericarp) and an acqueous extract of shea cake (obtained from de-husked ground kernels, and thus phase oil-free) were used in short-term choice-tests and in long-term force-feeding trials, in order to assess the feeding deterrence or stimulation [...] The results show that for both termite species shea cake extract is a feeding deterrent, thus confirming its potential as a wood preservative. However, most interestingly, the extract from shea nut shells elicited a very strong feeding stimulant effect, which looks extremely promising to increase the attractiveness -and therefore efficiency- of the baits. Further analytical investigations (to determine the total rate of terpenoids and polyphenols) on both extracts are in progress in order to identify the active components responsible for the observed effects. 1) J.

30|$|Injudicious use of {{resources}} and <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> have over-exploited the natural resources and caused {{detrimental effects on the}} environment. Unplanned economic development has led to pressure on cultivable land and suitable water for irrigation. To meet the food demands of exponentially growing human population, cultivation of food crops is carried out at places which are not suitable for agriculture like along wastewater drains or other polluted sites. To address water crisis, irrigation using the large amount of wastewater discharged from the rapid growing industries is being carried out {{in many parts of the}} world. Wastewater used for irrigation has many contaminants mainly heavy metals depending upon the source of discharge (Huibers and Van Lier 2005; Pedrero et al. 2010). In most of the developing countries, the wastewater discarded from industrial or residential areas is not treated and even, if it is treated the treatment process involves only primary processes which generally, do not remove heavy metals from the water. Long term use of wastewater for irrigation can cause accumulation of these metals in soil which can be further translocated to food crops and thus enter food chain (Arora et al. 2008; Gupta et al. 2010; Singh and Agrawal 2010). Though, such cultivation strategies help in addressing the issues of unemployment and increase the crop yield but the global food security is not attained. According to World Health Organization (WHO), food security is achieved when “everyone and always” have access to “sufficient and safe” food. Intake of metals through diet is reported across the globe and health hazards associated with these metals are also known (Arora et al. 2008; Orisakwe et al. 2012; Petroczi and Naughton 2009; Singh et al. 2010; Zhuang et al. 2009). Metals being persistent keep accumulating and magnifying with increase in trophic level of food chain. Accumulation of heavy metals beyond permissible limits affects vital organs like, kidneys, bones, liver and blood and causes serious health hazards. Health effects associated with heavy metals like, cadmium, copper, lead and chromium include gastrointestinal effects, renal impairment, neurological disorders, cardiovascular troubles, bone problems, convulsions, paralysis etc. Metals, because of their solubility in water, are toxic and the toxicity can be acute or chronic dependent upon exposure-time (Dorne et al. 2011; Järup 2003). Toxicological studies have found heavy metals to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic and neurotoxic (European Union 2002).|$|E
30|$|Geocommunication and geovisualization {{were used}} as {{interactive}} participatory mapping tools to understand the risk due to extreme precipitation in the coastal areas of Chennai (Glaser et al. 2008), {{and the results were}} publically accessible through an information portal. Strategies to reduce flood risks were detailed in Gupta and Nair (2010, 2011), which include directions such as the protection of lakes and open water bodies from encroachment and eviction of existing encroachments by governmental agencies. Flood avoidance, flood tolerance and flood resilience strategies should be combined into an integrated mode to build up flood resistance in the city. A basin model was developed by using a hydrological model based on remote sensing (HEC-GeoHMS), and the run-off due to precipitation was simulated using the HEC-HMS model in the Thirusoolam sub-watershed in Chennai (Suriya and Mudgal 2012). Flood hazard and flood zone mapping were also carried out, and the study showed the impacts of urbanization on hydrological processes. Different available methods to tackle the damage caused by the flood and the methodology to assess the economic loss in the Velachery region, Chennai, were discussed by Suriya et al. (2012). The methods include problem identification tasks composed of focus group discussion, stakeholder meeting, the questionnaire survey, succeeded by the data set preparation and flood damage assessment. Soft systems methodology (Rich Picture Diagrams and CATWOE analysis) was used for an integrated flood management and assessment in Adyar watershed in Chennai (Suriya and Mudgal 2012). A vulnerability assessment study was carried out in the region using satellite data and GIS techniques. Shoreline change rates were derived, and the Chennai coastal region was classified as a highly vulnerable zone (Mariappan and Devi 2012). Pairwise ranking (ranking and prioritizing a decision criteria) and force field analysis (visual identification and analysis of the forces affecting the flood situation), which are participatory action research tools used, were also used. Hydrological (HEC-HMS) and Hydraulic (HEC-RAS) modelling was used in feasibility analysis to control the flooding (Gokilashree 2015). The study proposed a new drainage channel in south-west Chennai, which will reduce the inundation area by 70 %. Some flood mitigation and prevention strategies such as the revival of Buckingham Canal and renovating the surface water bodies in the region were proposed (Selvaraj et al. 2016), in addition to the call for better strategies considering future extreme scenarios. Jameson and Baud 2016 showed the influence of a variety of knowledge about the flooding in creating a more efficient flood management system in Chennai. Meteosat IR rainfall data, measured using a multispectral rainfall signature-based rainfall estimation technique, were used to monitor the 2015 flood (Mishra 2016), and the 2015 flood scenario was analysed using an integrated geographical information system (GIS) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method (Seenirajan et al. 2017). Ahmed and Kranthi (2018) found that around 18 % of the Chennai Metropolitan Area was affected by the 2015 flood event, using satellite data from Landsat- 8 OLI, Sentinel- 1 and CartoDEM- 3 R 1. Arabindoo (2016) discussed the argument among environmentalists and the administration where the former targeted the <b>haphazard</b> <b>urbanization</b> as a strong reason for the floods in the city and the later considered it as an unprecedented climate anomaly {{in the history of the}} city. Sharma et al. (2017) showed the potential of global rainfall products (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)) and global forecast precipitation products (Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) in successful flood mapping of the region. Methods such as map and site analysis, focus group interview and questionnaire survey were employed by Muneerudeen (2017) to compose urban and landscape design strategies for flood resilience.|$|E
