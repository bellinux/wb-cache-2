50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|E

Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7  years; range: 65 – 96  years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1  years (range: 1 – 3  years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 – 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the head screws. Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12  months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12  months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients’ fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures.

40|$|Zur Diagnostik von Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette wird häufig die im Vergleich zur Sonografie deutlich kostenintensivere Magnetresonanztomografie durchgeführt. Ein Grund hierfür ist, dass es zum Teil schwierig ist, standardisierte statische Sonografie-Bilder zu gewinnen, was die reproduzierbare, untersucherunabhängige diagnostische Information verringert. Ziel des ersten Teils der Arbeit war es einerseits, zu analysieren, ob mit der 3 D-Sonografie diese Probleme verringert werden könnten und andererseits die Sensitivität mit dem 2 D-Ultraschall zur Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen zu vergleichen. Bei der Untersuchung von 114 Patienten konnten mit dem 3 D-Ultraschall Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette gut dargestellt werden. Der Vergleich zwischen 2 D- und 3 D-Ultraschall ergab keinen statistisch signifikanten Unterschied zwischen beiden Verfahren für die Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen. Ein Vorteil war die Möglichkeit der untersucherunabhängigen simultanen Auswertung von drei standardisierten Schnittebenen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt. Bei der Verwendung biodegradierbarer Anker zur Fixierung von Weichteilen können ossäre Reaktionen auftreten. Ziel war es, die frühen Reaktionen des umgebenden Gewebes auf einen Poly-(L-co-D/L-Lactid) 70 / 30 Anker im Vergleich zu einem Titananker im Schafsknochen zu analysieren. Innerhalb von 20 Wochen nach Implantation zeigte sich keinerlei Verlust von Knochensubstanz im Bereich des distalen Schafsfemur bei Ankern aus Titan oder aus Polylactid. Vielmehr zeigte sich eine ausgeprägte Neuformation von spongiösem Knochen in die Implantathohlräume vor allem für das biodegradierbare Material. Daher sollten neben materialbedingten Ursachen auch biomechanische Ursachen wie zyklische Belastungen für mögliche Osteolysen in Betracht gezogen werden. Die arthroskopische subacromiale Dekompression (ASD) ist ein häufig durchgeführtes Verfahren zur Therapie von Subachromialsyndromen. Es sollten die eigenen Ergebnisse seit 1993 unter Berücksichtigung von Nebendiagnosen sowie die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Scores und VAS auch telefonisch erheben zu können, analysiert werden. Die Untersuchung von 422 Schultern zwischen 1, 5 und 9, 5 Jahren (durchschnittlich 4, 8 Jahre) nach der Operation zeigte, dass die ASD mit überwiegend guten und sehr guten subjektiven und objektiven Resultaten (ca. 75 %) ein zuverlässiges {{operatives}} Verfahren ist. Im Gegensatz zu einem laufenden Rentenverfahren hatten Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette zum Zeitpunkt der Operation keinen negativen Einfluss auf das Operationsergebnis. Bei Nichtbeachtung der Pathologie des superioren Labrums und bei Rezidivoperation kam es zu einem erhöhten Anteil an Therapieversagern. Die telefonische Erhebung verschiedener Schulter-Scores (ausgenommen Constant-Score) und der VAS lieferte valide Resultate, die eine klinische Untersuchung entbehrlich machen und insbesondere bei Langzeitstudien eine wesentlich höhere Nachuntersuchungsrate ermöglichen. Das Konzept der winkelstabilen Osteosynthese ermöglicht eine weichteilschonende, minimal-invasive Frakturstabilisierung. Um eine sichere Verankerung von winkelstabilen Schrauben zu erreichen, ist eine korrekte Positionierung der Schraube in der Platte erforderlich. In biomechanischen Testungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass bei einer geringen Abweichung des Insertionswinkels winkelstabiler Schrauben von bis zu 5 ° vom optimalen Winkel immer noch eine hohe Stabilität der Schrauben-/Plattenverbindung gewährleistet war. Ab einem Winkel von über 5 ° kam es zu einer signifikanten Abnahme der Festigkeit dieser Verbindung. Um eine optimale Festigkeit der Verbindung Schraube/Platte zu erreichen und das Risiko der Schraubenlockerung zu minimieren, ist die konsequente Benutzung eines Zielgerätes zu empfehlen. Die klinische Nachuntersuchung von 53 Patienten mit winkelstabiler Osteosynthese bei proximaler Humerusfraktur zeigte eine mit der Literatur vergleichbare Komplikationsrate bei verringertem sekundären Dislokationsrisiko. Es zeigte sich aber auch die Problematik dieser Fakturen mit langer Nachbehandlungsdauer und dem Risiko einer Humeruskopfnekrose im Verlauf. Winkelstabile Implantate ermöglichten eine sichere Stabilisierung von proximalen Humerusfrakturen, konnten jedoch eine insuffiziente Anwendung - wie eine fehlerhafte Verankerung der Kopfverriegelungsschrauben - nicht kompensieren. Erhöht war das Risiko einer Schraubenperforation durch die Sinterung des Kopfes auf das rigide Implantat. Goal of {{the study}} was evaluation of advantages and limitations of shoulder diagnosis and different techniques of minimal invasive shoulder surgery. MRI has become the standard for diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions, since {{it can be difficult to}} obtain standardized ultrasound images. Goal {{of the study}} was analysis of sensitivity of 3 D- in comparison to 2 D-ultrasound. Examination of 114 patients showed excellent visualization of rotor cuff defects with 3 D-ultrasound. Comparison to 2 D-ultrasound showed no statistical significant difference between both methods for diagnosis of full- and partial thickness defects of the rotator cuff. Advantage of 3 D-ultrasound was the possibility of simultaneous visualization of three standardized planes. For the reattachment of ligaments and tendons biodegradable implants are increasingly used today. However, with the use of biodegradable implants early and late osteolysis has been reported. Goal of this study was to analyze the early osseous integration of a newly designed suture anchor in comparison to a titanium implant. The implants made of Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 or titanium were inserted into the cancellous bone of the distal femoral condyle in four sheep. The animals were followed radiographically over a period of 20 weeks in which no final implant degradation was anticipated. After sacrifice new bone formation was quantitatively and local tissue response qualitatively analyzed from microradiographs and histological sections were examined. New bone formation was seen around both implant materials within 20 weeks. Inside the recess of the polylactide suture anchor there was significantly higher bony ingrowth (p = 0. 026) as compared to the titanium implant. Histologically non of the materials did show any inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that early osteolysis around Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 suture anchors in cancellous bone may not be attributable to the material properties but rather to other reasons such as the mechanical situation at the implant-bone interface. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) has become a well established procedure to treat chronic subacromial impingement syndrome. Goal {{of the study was}} to retrospectively evaluate the outcome and to evaluate the validity of data collection by telephone interview. The examination of 422 patients average 4. 8 years after peration showed in 75 % goog and excellent results. The average Constant score (raw score) improved from 46 to 80 Pts. Patients who had a second ASD had good results in only 25 %. Patients with running workers compensation application showed no satisfying outcome. Lesions of the rotator cuff were shown to have no significant influence on the outcome in comparison to patients with intact rotator cuff. Additionally, it was shown that the assessment of various shoulder scores (except Constant Score) by telephone interview is possible. Internal fixators with angular stability have been developed in order to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. The insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Locking screws were inserted in a isolated or combined locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 °(optimal condition), 5 ° and 10 °. The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. Locking screws inserted in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 ° and 10 ° angle. Screws inserted in the combined locking hole (LCP) also showed a significant decrease of push-out force of 77 % with 10 ° axis deviation. A locking <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> exhibits a high stability with a moderate axis deviation in the angle of insertion of up to 5 °. However there is a significant decrease in stability with increasing axis deviation (> 5 °). A aiming device is recommended to provide an optimal fixation with angular stability. Clinical Examination of 53 patients with angular stable osteosynthesis of proximal humeral fractures showed a rate of complications, which can be compared with literature with lower risk of secondary dislocation.

40|$|Objectives: To assess biomechanically {{different}} fixations {{means of}} the sacroiliac joint with pedicle screws and to compare the traditional head height with reduced ones. Methods: We used a polyethylene model representing the pelvic ring and simu-lated a unilateral sacroiliac dislocation. We set up three different constructions: 1) two screws attached to a rod; 2) two rods connected to two small <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> each; and 3) two rods connected to two average <b>headed</b> <b>screws</b> each. We conducted tests in a biomechanical testing and a mechanized processing laboratory. Results: Group 1 supported an average maximum load of 99. 70 N. Group 2 supported an average maximum load of 362. 46 N. Group 3 endured an average maximum load of 404. 15 N. In the assembly with one rod, the resistance de-creased {{as compared with the}} one with two bars: 72. 5 % com-pared to small-headed screws and 75. 3 % to the traditional screw. Conclusion: The assembly with a single bar presented inferior results when compared to the double bar assembly. There was no statistical difference in the results between the screws used.

5000|$|The nail bomb is an anti-personnel {{explosive}} device packed with nails {{to increase its}} effectiveness at harming victims. The nails act as shrapnel, leading almost certainly to greater loss of life and injury in inhabited areas than the explosives alone would. The nail bomb is also a type of flechette weapon. Such weapons use bits of shrapnel (steel balls, nail <b>heads,</b> <b>screws,</b> needles, broken razors, darts and bits of metal) to create a larger radius of destruction.|$|R
