2500|$|The ranch, {{located in}} west Uintah County {{bordering}} the Ute Indian Reservation, was popularly dubbed the [...] "UFO ranch" [...] {{due to its}} ostensible 50-year history of odd events said {{to have taken place}} there.

According to Kelleher and Knapp, they saw or investigated evidence of close to 100 incidents that include vanishing and mutilated cattle, sightings of unidentified flying objects or orbs, large animals with piercing red eyes that they say were not injured when struck by bullets, and invisible objects emitting destructive magnetic fields. Among those involved were retired Army Colonel John B. Alexander who characterized the NIDSci effort as an attempt to get <b>hard</b> <b>data</b> using a [...] "standard scientific approach".

But before considering this problem, let us briefly consider what the problem is not.|$|E
60|$|Our data now are {{primarily}} {{the facts of}} sense (i.e. of our own sense-data) {{and the laws of}} logic. But even the severest scrutiny will allow some additions to this slender stock. Some facts of memory--especially of recent memory--seem to have the highest degree of certainty. Some introspective facts are as certain as any facts of sense. And facts of sense themselves must, for our present purposes, be interpreted with a certain latitude. Spatial and temporal relations must sometimes be included, for example {{in the case of a}} swift motion falling wholly within the specious present. And some facts of comparison, such as the likeness or unlikeness of two shades of colour, are certainly to be included among <b>hard</b> <b>data.</b> Also we must remember that the distinction of hard and soft data is psychological and subjective, so that, if there are other minds than our own--which at our present stage must be held doubtful--the catalogue of <b>hard</b> <b>data</b> may be different for them from what it is for us.|$|E

It is, however, a psychologically derivative belief, since it results from observation of people's bodies; and along with other such beliefs, it does not belong to the hardest of <b>hard</b> <b>data,</b> but becomes, under the influence of philosophic reflection, just sufficiently questionable to make us desire some argument connecting it with the facts of sense.|$|E

Belief in what is reported by the testimony of others, including all that we learn from books, is of course involved in the doubt as to whether other people have minds at all.
