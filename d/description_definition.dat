30|$|MPEG- 7 defined both {{syntactic}} and semantic decompositions {{to describe}} syntactic and semantic content in parallel [28, 29]. [28] gave {{an overview of}} the MPEG- 7 <b>description</b> <b>definition</b> language. Besides objectives and specification of MPEG- 7 systems, new challenges were discussed in [29], such as the delivery of descriptions either separate or jointly with the audio-visual content, and the like. Recently, media adaptation was achieved by using MPEG- 21 digital item adaptation framework [30, 31]. In [30], visual content was tailored within the MPEG- 21 digital item adaptation (DIA) framework to meet users' visual perception characteristics. In [31], the proposed content on demand method adapted the video with MPEG- 21 DIA framework to satisfy users' preference in video content.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. MPEG- 7 (Multimedia Content Description Interface) is a {{standard}} for describing the content of multimedia data and adopts XML (eXtensible Markup Language) Schema as its <b>Description</b> <b>Definition</b> Language. However, as a forthcoming standard for querying XML data/documents, XQuery (XML Query Language) has weakness in the query of vector-based feature described in MPEG- 7. Thus, we propose an extension to XQuery, that is, VeXQuery (Vector-based XQuery) language, to resolve the problem of vector-based feature query in MPEG- 7 retrieval. To fulfill the vector-based feature query, VeXQuery gives a set of vector similarity measurement expressions and defines the formal semantics of VeXQuery in terms of XQuery itself. Through this approach VeXQuery can be integrated seamlessly into XQuery. Keywords: XQuery, MPEG- 7, content-based retrieval, feature-based query...|$|E
40|$|MPEG- 7 aims to {{standardize}} descriptors, descriptor schemes, and a <b>description</b> <b>definition</b> language for multimedia content {{in order to}} facilitate content applications such as multimedia searching, filtering, browsing, and editing. In this document, we propose a description scheme for archive content that meets the requirements outlined in the MPEG- 7 requirement document. Under the proposed schemes, a multimedia archive is represented as a hierarchy of clusters that index the multimedia content of the archive based on semantics, visual information, and feature relationships, among others. This proposal complements the description schemes for image, video, audio, synthetic video, multimedia, and home media content presented in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. 1 INTRODUCTION The ease of creating, capturing, and accessing digital audio-visual information requires an interoperable method of describing multimedia content and derived knowledge in order to enable efficient and distributed systems for [...] ...|$|E

MPEG- 7 will standardize five types of audiovisual description tools: descriptors, description schemes, coding schemes, some systems tools and a <b>description</b> <b>definition</b> language. Yet to retrieve content based on MPEG- 7 descriptions, some non-normative tools are needed, notably the similarity measure used in the matching process.

The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal <b>descriptions</b> or <b>definitions.</b> The <b>description</b> or <b>definition</b> of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008).
