25|$|Alfredsson {{was arguably}} Ottawa's {{best player in}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Senators {{ultimately}} lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock to see if he had time to move in for a better shot, and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E
60|$|Jims {{looked to}} see if she meant it; then <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky again.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wragg <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young {{fisherman}} towering above him, and {{eyed him}} disdainfully.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a great charge," [...] said <b>the</b> Commander, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} tracery {{of steel}} outlined against {{the deep blue}} sky.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dix whistled softly and, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tall, white-faced {{young man}} before him, pushed his cap back and {{scratched}} his head.|$|R
60|$|The hermit <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inn on the {{hillside}} whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony.|$|E
60|$|Now Umslopogaas <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stone face of her who sat aloft, {{and it was}} alight {{with the}} sunset.|$|E
60|$|Psyche <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wasted limb, {{and when}} she drew again there was a blur before {{her eyes for a}} minute.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, sir," [...] {{returned}} Mr. George, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great {{letters in}} which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Burke," [...] said Captain Horn, quickly, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> noon-day sun, [...] "put her {{out there}} near the wreckage, and take an observation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite unfathomable," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{windows of}} the house, a modern {{structure}} in the new part of the town.|$|R
60|$|As {{the word}} 'brotherly' passed {{through his mind}} {{in one of his}} reveries, he smiled, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture of Mozart that was before him...|$|E
60|$|The old {{druggist}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl {{under his}} spectacles, noted her patriotic attire and the eager {{look on her}} pretty face, and slowly shook his head.|$|E
60|$|Daniel Hawkins {{had just}} come out to care for his horse. By sheer {{accident}} he had <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window and beheld Leo {{in the act of}} dropping out.|$|E
60|$|He kept <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{height of}} the ceilings, {{the size of the}} rooms, taking in the size and {{proportion}} of the house, {{and the quality of the}} fittings.|$|R
6000|$|And {{followed}} by STEEL, he descends {{the steps and}} moves away. [...] Two policemen pass <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> broken glass. One of them [...] stops and makes a note.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he {{may have}} perished in this piece of mischief," [...] said Alf, anxiously <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kite, which was {{dragging}} the heavily-laden sledge rather slowly over the rough ice.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} on {{his side of the}} bargain. Now came mine. I folded tight my hands in my lap, <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flaming lamp. How much would he pay me? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a dark}} passage, and Liffie Lee almost quaked at {{the depth}} and {{metallic}} solemnity of the voice, as she <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spot where it appeared to come from.|$|E
60|$|We {{stepped down}} {{on to the}} platform. Louis, for some reason, seemed {{slightly}} nervous. He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock and watched the few late arrivals with an interest which was almost intense.|$|E
6000|$|... "How say you, Prince? {{shall we}} cross?" [...] asked Stanley, as they rested on their paddles and cast furtive <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark clouds {{and across the}} still quiet bay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, {{with his}} hand on the cab apron, and a sudden <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> windows of his flat, [...] "I ought to tell my cousin Jane--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Light air, west-sou'-west," [...] muttered the Captain as {{he stepped}} on deck, cast a <b>glance</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vane on the mast-head, and then swept his eye round the (imaginary) horizon.|$|R
60|$|As the car {{drove off}} without his having once <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, she shivered a little. There {{was a silence}} which, it seemed to her, could be more minatory even than accusation.|$|E
60|$|The {{other man}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lighted windows, and Appleby, who slipped {{back out of}} sight into the shadow, {{saw that he was}} white with dust, and surmised that he was {{correspondingly}} thirsty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Both Mr Brodrick and I {{think it}} {{probable}} that your uncle's last will may yet be concealed {{somewhere in the}} house." [...] Cousin Henry's eye, as this was said, again <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fatal shelf.|$|E
60|$|An elderly, grey-whiskered gentleman {{had been}} walking down <b>the</b> street, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{numbers of the}} houses. Now as his eyes fell upon the old man, he came {{straight}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said he, {{and settled}} down to his book again, {{but his eyes were}} for ever darting little {{suspicious}} <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window. I watched it also, but all was quiet outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks like it, sir," [...] said Mr Moor, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vast clouds {{which were}} {{at that time}} {{spreading}} like a black pall over the re-awakened volcano. [...] "Do you expect 'em back soon, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harper <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon. “If it {{had been}} darker it would have suited me just as well,” he said. “The trouble {{is that if a}} gunboat came along you wouldn’t see her in the mist.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Down in {{the failing}} light Prosper Profond moved, {{his hands in}} his side pockets, {{whistling}} softly in his beard; he stopped, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, as if saying: [...] "I don't think much of that small moon." ...|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{knocked the}} ash from his cigar and {{replaced}} it in his mouth. His clasped hands rested in front of him. There was a twinkle of something almost like mirth in {{his eyes as he}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inspector.|$|E
60|$|He {{burst into}} a loud and {{unpleasant}} laugh which made Dain stare at him with some apprehension, but got off the gunwale {{of the boat and}} moved slowly towards Nina, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun as he walked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Joe, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dutch clock, [...] "she's {{been on the}} Ram-page, {{this last}} spell, about five minutes, Pip. She's a coming! Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you." ...|$|R
60|$|The men {{followed}} {{them out on}} the yard, and worked in desperate haste, with occasional <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mast head. In a couple of minutes the sail was firmly secured in its gaskets, and all made their way below.|$|R
