Pipeline dredge engineering presents {{a complex and}} dynamic process necessary to maintain navigable waterways.

Previous work in engineering incorporated an object{oriented expert{system to determine cost and scheduling of mid{rise building construction where data objects represent the fundamental elements of the construction process within the program execution. A previously developed dredge cost estimating spreadsheet program which uses hydraulic engineering and slurry transport principles determines the performance metrics of a <b>dredge</b> <b>pump</b> and pipeline system. This study focuses on combining hydraulic analysis with the functionality of an expert{system to determine the performance metrics of a <b>dredge</b> <b>pump</b> and pipeline system and its resulting schedule. Field data from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers pipeline dredge, Goetz, and several contract daily dredge reports show how accurately the DKBES can predict pipeline dredge production. Real{time dredge instrumentation data from the Goetz compares the accuracy of the Pipeline Analytical Program to actual dredge operation. Comparison of the Pipeline Analytical Program to pipeline daily dredge reports shows how accurately the Pipeline Analytical Program can predict a dredge project's schedule over several months. Both of these comparisons determine the accuracy and validity of the Pipeline Analytical Program and DKBES as they calculate the performance metrics of the pipeline dredge project. The results of the study determined that the Pipeline Analytical Program compared closely to the Goetz eld data where only pump and pipeline hydraulics a ected the dredge production. Results from the dredge projects determined the Pipeline Analytical Program underestimated actual long{term dredge production.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{introduction}} of jumbo trailing suction hopper dredgers {{and the development of}} deep sea dredging equipment came suction pipe constructions and gantries of ever increasing dimensions. The implementation of submerged <b>dredge</b> <b>pumps</b> and the application of longer and greater number of pipe sections of large diameter resulted in suction pipe constructions which distinguish themselves from traditional constructions by their bigger mass and deviating mass distribution. Given the fact that these characteristics have changed significantly and are features that determine the dynamic motion behaviour of a suction pipe construction, one enters a new field concerning the dynamic behaviour of these constructions. This paper describes a mathematical model, developed at IHC Holland’s R&D institute MTI Holland in co-operation with Delft University of Technology. With this mathematical model one can perform calculations in the frequency domain to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an arbitrary suction pipe construction during the hoisting or lowering operation above the water line. These eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the dynamic motion behaviour of the suction pipe construction. By implementing the motions of the vessel into the model it was furthermore made possible to determine th...|$|R
50|$|Borrow pits {{containing}} suitable material {{are accessible}} at an elevation {{such that the}} earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles. Hydraulic fill {{is likely to be}} the most economic method of construction. Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a <b>dredge</b> <b>pump.</b> In the construction of a hydraulic fill dam, the edges of the dam are defined by low embankments or dykes which are built upward as the fill progresses. The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The sluices discharge their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by discharge control. While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later.|$|R

40|$|Dredging is {{the process}} of {{excavation}} of sediment, usually carried out underwater, with the purpose of the collection of the excavated sediment, such as sand, and subsequently its disposition at another location. In {{order to be able to}} predict the performance of dredging equipment, such as <b>dredging</b> <b>pumps</b> and hoppers, a two-phase numerical flow simulation method has been developed for conditions for which the volume fraction of the solid volume fraction (sand) is high. The method is based on the equations for the two-fluid model. The flow field is described by the conservation equations of mass and momentum for the solid phase (sand) and for the fluid phase (water), in combination with constitutive relations that describe the behaviour of the sand-water mixture, implemented in the commercial CFD-code Ansys CFX 14. 0. The viscosity of suspensions has been analysed experimentally, utilizing a concentric cylinder rheometer. In the experimental work, carried out with neutrally buoyant particles, parameters that determine the behaviour of the suspension have been varied, using the same particulate and liquid material for all experiments. The solid volume fraction, particle diameter, liquid viscosity, and shear rate, have been varied systematically. An investigation has been carried out into a model for the particle pressure, required to model the formation of a particle bed when the volume fraction of the particles reaches its maximum obtainable value. Dredging is often carried out by ships, storing the sediment in a large hold called a hopper. A sand-water mixture is taken from the bottom of the <b>dredging</b> site and <b>pumped</b> into the hopper. As an example of the application of the developed simulation method, the flow in a hopper during the filling process is considered. A parameter study has been carried out by varying the flow conditions at the inlet of the hopper: velocity at the inlet, solid volume fraction at the inlet and particle diameter of the incoming suspension. The results show how these parameters affect the filling curve of the hopper, defined as the total mass of sand present inside the hopper as function of time...|$|R
40|$|Unremitting {{waves and}} {{occasional}} storms bring dynamic forces {{to bear on}} the coast. Sediment flux results in various patterns of erosion and accretion, with an overwhelming majority (80 to 90 percent) of coastline in the eastern U. S. exhibiting net erosion in recent decades. Climate change threatens to increase the intensity of storms and raise sea level 18 to 59 centimeters over the next century. Following a lengthy tradition of economic models for natural resource management, this paper provides a dynamic optimization model for managing coastal erosion and explores the types of data necessary to employ the model for normative policy analysis. The model conceptualizes benefits of beach and dune sediments as service flows accruing to nearby residential property owners, local businesses, recreational beach users, and perhaps others. Benefits can also include improvements in habitat for beach- and dune-dependent plant and animal species. The costs of maintaining beach sediment in the presence of coastal erosion include expenditures on <b>dredging,</b> <b>pumping,</b> and placing sand on the beach to maintain width and height. Other costs can include negative impacts on the nearshore environment. Employing these constructs, an optimal control model is specified that provides a framework for identifying the conditions under which beach replenishment enhances economic welfare and an optimal schedule for replenishment can be derived under a constant sea level and erosion rate (short term) as well as an increasing sea level and erosion rate (long term). Under some simplifying assumptions, the conceptual framework can examine the time horizon of management responses under sea level rise, identifying the timing of shift to passive management (shoreline retreat) and exploring factors that influence this potential shift.
