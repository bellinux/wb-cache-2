50|$|In {{an effort}} to unify the {{visualization}} of PMI across the different existing solutions, Adobe Systems has released {{a version of the}} Myriad CAD font that allows display of PMI information from almost any CAD application. Similarly, Siemens PLM Software offers <b>downloadable</b> <b>font</b> sets for multiple languages such as for Asian character sets. The ISO 10303 STEP standards also handle a wide range of PMI information.|$|R

The <b>downloadable</b> <b>font</b> created by this averaged handwriting experiment is heavily influenced by the user prompt, whereby the user is presented with 26 capital letters in random order in the Arial font. Within the confines of this self-selection bias, regional differences are still easily recognizable.|$|R
2500|$|Microsoft first {{added support}} for <b>downloadable</b> [...] EOT <b>fonts</b> in Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. Authors {{had to use}} the {{proprietary}} WEFT tool to create a subsetted font file for each page. EOT showed that webfonts could work and the format saw some use in writing systems not supported by common operating systems. However, the format never gained widespread acceptance and was ultimately rejected by W3C.|$|R
50|$|However, OEM code pages do not {{necessarily}} reside in ROM, but include so called prepared code pages, (aka downloadable character sets or <b>downloadable</b> <b>fonts),</b> character sets loaded as raster fonts into the font RAM of suitable display adapters (like NEC APC, HP 100LX/200LX/700LX, Persyst's BoB Color Adapter, Hercules' HGC+, InColor and Network Plus with RAMFONT, and IBM's MCGA, EGA, VGA, etc.) and printers as well. Hence, the group of OEM code pages is a superset of hardware code pages.|$|E
50|$|Another Ascender study {{researched}} {{the free and}} shareware fonts {{that can be found}} on the most-popular Websites. The study analyzed more than 4500 TrueType fonts that can be downloaded by Macintosh, Windows and GNU/Linux users to determine their viability for use in linking <b>downloadable</b> <b>fonts</b> to web pages as part of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specification proposed by the W3C. The study found that out of the 4572 fonts tested, 4385 fonts (95.9%) failed one or more of six tests that were performed.|$|E
5000|$|The Terak 8510/a of 1976 or 1977 was {{the first}} {{graphics}} desktop personal computer. It was a desktop workstation with an LSI-11 compatible processor, a graphical frame buffer, and a text mode with <b>downloadable</b> <b>fonts.</b> Despite {{the lack of a}} MMU, it was capable of running a stripped version of UNIX version 6. It {{was the first}} personal machine on which the UCSD p-System was widely used. Various universities in the USA used it in the late 1970s and early 1980s to teach Pascal programming. It provided immediate graphic feedback from simple programs encouraging students to learn.|$|E
50|$|While {{competing}} printers {{and their}} associated control languages offered {{some of the}} capabilities of PostScript, they were limited {{in their ability to}} reproduce free-form layouts (as a desktop publishing application might produce), use outline fonts, or offer the level of detail and control over the page layout. HP's own LaserJet was driven by a simple page description language, known as Printer Command Language, or PCL. The version for the LaserJet, PCL4, was adapted from earlier inkjet printers with the addition of <b>downloadable</b> bitmapped <b>fonts.</b> It lacked the power and flexibility of PostScript until several upgrades provided some level of parity. It was some time before similar products became available on other platforms, by which time the Mac had ridden the desktop publishing market to success.|$|R
50|$|The need {{to write}} Luo in a {{different}} script other than the Latin script has always been there since {{the introduction of the}} English alphabet by colonialists. However, {{there has not been a}} good reason why none was developed earlier. Other African writing systems have been developed before and some are still in use today. Work on the Luo alphabet started in 2009 by Kefa Ombewa. At the same time Paul Sidandi started his work on Luo numerals independently. The two gentlemen met on Twitter in 2013 and decided to combine the alphabet and the numerals to be a single project and the font produced was named KefaSidandi font. Digitization of the work started with a lot of challenges. Initially only a bitmap-font was available. Thereafter in order to produce the true-type font internet usage, Will Were joined to produce the font glyphs. The work was completed on June 12, 2012 when the first true-type font was produced. This led to the ability to embed the script on the Luo Alphabet website and made the <b>font</b> <b>downloadable</b> for other interested users. The Luo alphabet first came into the limelight in Kenya when Kefa Ombewa conducted an interview with Kenya Television Network (KTN) in 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} render the test correctly, user agents need to {{implement}} the CSS 3 Text Shadows and the CSS 2.x <b>Downloadable</b> <b>Fonts</b> specifications, which are currently under consideration by W3C to be standardized. This is required as the test uses a custom TrueType font, called [...] "AcidAhemTest", to cover up a 20x20 red square. Supporting Truetype fonts however is not required by the CSS specification. A browser supporting only OpenType fonts with CFF outlines or Embedded OpenType fonts could support the CSS standard, but fail the test in the Acid3 test. The glyph, when rendered by the downloaded font, is just a square, made white with CSS, and thus invisible.|$|E
40|$|POSTSCRIPT is a page {{description}} language {{which is used}} to transmit printing information from a host computer (i. e. Apple Macintosh) to a printer (i. e. Apple LaserWriter Plus). It has the ability to describe pages consisting of text, vector graphics, and scanned bit-map images. Printing text is the area of concentration for this thesis. Specifically several variables that affect the printing speed of a common POSTSCRIPT printer, the Apple LaserWriter Plus, are looked at when printing text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and orientations. The variables that affect printer performance include: - use of outline vs. bit-map fonts; - the outline font rasterization process; - the use of pre-cached bit-map fonts; - background outline font rasterization; - arbitrary scaling and rotation; - downloading host-resident fonts; - Adobe and Third Party host-resident <b>downloadable</b> <b>fonts</b> vs. printer-resident fonts; - Appletalk vs. RS- 232 communications interfaces; - use of the POSTSCRIPT show, ashow, and widthshow instructions; - targeting the POSTSCRIPT instructions at a particular engine resolution; - print engine overhead A sequence of POSTSCRIPT files were transmitted to the Apple LaserWriter Plus printer. The experiments were carefully constructed to exercize each of the variables listed above. Performance measurements were carefully recorded and analyzed. Where applicable, improvements were proposed to improve printer performance...|$|E
