500|$|Martin Conway {{describes}} {{the portrayal of}} a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep [...] "furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow". Conway believed {{the strength of the}} portrait is in part achieved through Dürer's ability to convey this hardship, {{while at the same time}} presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing [...] "a kind old face". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the <b>half</b> <b>smile</b> of the older man, he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr. A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.|$|E
2500|$|The French philosopher-film theorist Gilles Deleuze, in {{his book}} L'image-temps. Cinéma 2 (Cinema 2: The Time-Image, 1985), cited this {{particular}} scene {{as an example of}} what he referred to as the [...] "time image." [...] Simply put, Deleuze sees the vase as an image of unchanging time, although objects within time (for example, Noriko) do change (e.g., from joy to sadness). [...] "The vase in Late Spring is interposed between [...] <b>half</b> <b>smile</b> and the beginning of her tears. There is becoming, change, passage. But the form of what changes does not itself change, does not pass on. This is time, time itself, ‘a little bit of time in its pure state’: a direct time-image, which gives what changes the unchanging form in which the change is produced… The still life is time, for everything that changes is in time, but time does not itself change… Ozu's still lifes endure, have a duration, over ten seconds of the vase: this duration of the vase is precisely the representation of that which endures, through the succession of changing states." ...|$|E
