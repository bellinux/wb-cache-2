25|$|Many {{diseases}} involving {{red blood}} cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where {{a thin layer of}} blood is smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal abnormalities of red blood cell shape and form. When {{red blood cells}} sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b> This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical factors {{produced}} <b>during</b> <b>inflammation</b> (histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) sensitize pain receptors, cause local vasodilation of {{the blood}} vessels, and attract phagocytes, especially neutrophils. Neutrophils then trigger {{other parts of the}} immune system by releasing factors that summon additional leukocytes and lymphocytes. Cytokines produced by macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system mediate the inflammatory response. [...] These cytokines include TNF, HMGB1, and IL-1.|$|E

2500|$|Nociceptive pain {{is caused}} by {{stimulation}} of sensory nerve fibers that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity (nociceptors), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation. The most common categories are [...] "thermal" [...] (e.g. heat or cold), [...] "mechanical" [...] (e.g. crushing, tearing, shearing, etc.) and [...] "chemical" [...] (e.g. iodine in a cut or chemicals released <b>during</b> <b>inflammation).</b> Some nociceptors respond {{to more than one}} of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gene for}} human IL-17 is 1874 base pairs long and was cloned from CD4+ T cells. Each {{member of the}} IL-17 family has a {{distinct}} pattern of cellular expression. [...] The expression of IL-17A and IL-17F appear to be restricted to {{a small group of}} activated T cells, and upregulated <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b> IL-17B is expressed in several peripheral tissues and immune tissues. IL-17C is also highly upregulated in inflammatory conditions, although in resting conditions is low in abundance. [...] IL-17D is highly expressed in the nervous system and in skeletal muscle and [...] IL-17E is found at low levels in various peripheral tissues.|$|E
50|$|P-selectin {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the initial recruitment of leukocytes (white blood cells) to the site of injury <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b> When endothelial cells are activated by molecules such as histamine or thrombin <b>during</b> <b>inflammation,</b> P-selectin moves from an internal cell location to the endothelial cell surface.|$|E

50|$|Mammalian {{cells secrete}} calprotectin during the {{inflammatory}} response. For instance, calprotectin is secreted {{in the mouth}} <b>during</b> <b>inflammation</b> of the gingiva and during oral candidiasis infection. People who have mutations in the calprotectin gene appear susceptible to serious gum infections. Manganese sequestration by calprotectin is likely important during lung inflammation.

40|$|Abstract: Introduction: It {{has been}} {{approved}} that in most tissues NO production increases <b>during</b> acute <b>inflammation</b> and Angiotensin II has a role in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As regulation of joint blood flow (JBF) is important in this situation, this study was performed to investigate the interaction of local Ang II and ROS production and the modulatory role of NO on regulation of JBF <b>during</b> acute <b>inflammation.</b> Methods: The study was performed on 24 Newzealand white rabbits divided into three experimental and one control groups. Acute knee joint inflammation was produced by intraarticular injection of 0. 5 ml of a 2...|$|R

5000|$|Transport of nitric oxide: Nitric oxide is a vasodilatator. This {{assists in}} the {{regulation}} of vascular reaction in times of stress as experienced <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As an anti-inflammatory, dapsone {{inhibits}} {{the enzyme}} myeloperoxidase. As {{part of the}} respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide (...) into hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b> Dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme. This prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage <b>during</b> <b>inflammation.</b> Myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke.|$|E
40|$|M cells {{represent}} an important gateway for the intestinal immune system by delivering luminal antigens through the follicle-associated epithelium {{to the underlying}} immune cells. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize this route of antigen uptake <b>during</b> intestinal <b>inflammation</b> by characterizing M cell formation and M cell-associated lymphocytes after indomethacin challenge in rats. We demonstrated increased M cell formation as early as 12 h after a single injection of indomethacin. The elevated M cell counts were determined until day 3 and returned to basal levels after 7 days. Electron microscopic studies revealed an expansion of mononuclear cells inside the M cell pocket that were characterized predominantly as B cells, T cell receptor (TCR) αβ- and CD 4 -positve T cells, whereas other markers such as CD 11 b, CD 8 and CD 25 remained unchanged. In situ hybridization studies showed increased expression of interleukin (IL) - 4 by lymphocytes <b>during</b> intestinal <b>inflammation</b> in the Peyer's patch follicle. These studies illuminate the relevance of M cells <b>during</b> intestinal <b>inflammation</b> and suggest that M cells derive from epithelial cells in a certain microenvironment...|$|R

50|$|<b>During</b> <b>inflammation,</b> neutrophil-derived {{myeloperoxidase}} produces {{hypochlorous acid}} (HOCl). HOCl causes oxidative chlorination of plasmalogens at the sn-1 chain by reacting with the vinyl ether bond.

50|$|Consistent {{with this}} function, the mannose {{receptor}} is expressed at low levels <b>during</b> <b>inflammation</b> and {{at high levels}} during the resolution of inflammation, to ensure inflammatory agents are removed from the circulation only at the appropriate time.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Neutrophils {{accumulate}} in pulmonary capillaries <b>during</b> acute <b>inflammation.</b> Initial events in injury recognition and sequestration {{do not occur}} through selectin-mediated rolling.

40|$|Microglia are the {{resident}} macrophage-like {{populations in the}} central nervous system (CNS). Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia <b>during</b> acute <b>inflammation,</b> as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba 1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia <b>during</b> acute <b>inflammation,</b> which in turn <b>during</b> chronic <b>inflammation</b> stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination...|$|R
50|$|Reverse {{migration}} is the phenomena {{in which some}} neutrophils migrate away from the inflammation site, against the chemokine gradient, <b>during</b> <b>inflammation</b> resolution. The activation of in vivo inflammatory pathways (such as hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF), altered this behavior of reverse migration.|$|E
50|$|The EGF-like domain is {{also part}} of laminins, an {{important}} group of extracellular proteins. The EGF-like domains are usually masked in intact membranes, but become exposed when the membrane is destroyed, e.g. <b>during</b> <b>inflammation,</b> thereby stimulating membrane growth and restoring damaged membrane parts.|$|E
50|$|Increase in {{phospholipase}} A2 {{activity is}} an acute-phase reaction that rises <b>during</b> <b>inflammation,</b> {{which is also}} seen to be exponentially higher in low back disc herniations compared to rheumatoid arthritis.

50|$|Lactoferrin forms reddish complex with iron; its {{affinity}} for iron is 300 {{times higher than}} that of transferrin. The affinity increases in weakly acidic medium. This facilitates the transfer of iron from transferrin to lactoferrin <b>during</b> <b>inflammations,</b> when the pH of tissues decreases due to accumulation of lactic and other acids. The saturated iron concentration in lactoferrin in human milk is estimated as 10 to 30% (100% corresponds to all lactoferrin molecules containing 2 iron atoms). It is demonstrated that lactoferrin is involved not only in the transport of iron, zinc and copper, but also in the regulation of their intake. Presence of loose ions of zinc and copper does not affect the iron binding ability of lactoferrin, and might even increase it.|$|R
30|$|In addition, several immune {{components}} can actively {{cross the}} BBB via specific carrier <b>inflammation</b> <b>during</b> systemic <b>inflammation</b> [142]. Evidence from sepsis models suggests {{a role for}} C 5 a, and cytokines in the pathogenesis of {{the breakdown of the}} blood-brain barrier and the subsequent edema [143 – 146]. Thus, it seems that BBB dysfunction is a major fueling brain inflammation after sepsis. The mechanisms that drive BBB dysfunction are not fully understood, but include at least the activation of MMP- 2, MM 9, and MMP 8 [147, 148]. These proteases are responsible to degrade key proteins that maintain the functionality of the BBB.|$|R
