5|$|John von Neumann's work on {{functional}} analysis and topology in broke new ground {{in mathematics and}} economic theory.

The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the <b>geometry,</b> <b>and</b> other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime <b>geometry</b> <b>and</b> the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that {{some aspects of}} matrix models and M-theory are {{described}} by a noncommutative quantum field theory, {{a special kind of}} physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative <b>geometry</b> <b>and</b> various physical theories.|$|E
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere <b>geometry)</b> <b>and</b> a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E

The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
