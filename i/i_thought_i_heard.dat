500|$|Although the {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by several reviewers, some found {{the game to}} be unnecessarily long, repetitive and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival, requiring players {{to spend most of}} their time hiding in lockers [...] "staring at the motion tracker". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the alien creature, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore â€” I was annoyed." [...] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered a [...] "brave" [...] title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. As of January 2015, Alien: Isolation has sold over one million copies worldwide according to Sega. As of March 2015, the game has sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US.|$|E

The second time I was so nervous that I began to sing to keep my spirits up, and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan Emily, wot was lying alongside, came up from the fo'c'sle and offered to fight me. I was thankful when daylight came.|$|R
