25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Concord, Sauer {{branched}} out and began experimenting with Vitis vinifera including Sémillon and Chenin blanc. These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties {{to see what kind of}} grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to full ripeness.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reasons were}} {{initially}} posited by media sources {{and family members}} for why Menezes may have run from police, as indicated by initial reports. A few weeks prior, he had been attacked by a gang and may have perceived {{that he was in}} a similar situation upon seeing plainclothes officers chasing him. Several sources have speculated that irregularities about his immigration status may have given him reason to be wary of the police; evidence that emerged {{during the course of the}} criminal trial into the Health and Safety charge showed that Menezes was lawfully in the country on 22 July 2005. This is mentioned in the Stockwell One report, at footnote 4 on page 21. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a colleague believed that Menezes ran simply because he was late for his job. It was later indicated by the leaked IPCC documents that Menezes may have run across the platform to get a seat on the train, and did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that he was being watched or pursued.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the anti-stall to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

500|$|Hughes then {{phoned the}} police {{and told them that}} Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on valium. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up to the bedroom. They later {{reported}} that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him. Evans had previously been awarded the badge of [...] "Honorary Sheriff of Los Angeles County", but in the Los Angeles Times, he was referred to as a “jobless former road manager for the Beatles”.|$|E
2500|$|He {{certainly}} {{had an enormous}} influence on me [...] I remember that when I was Generalmusikdirektor in Aachen, a friend invited me to a concert that Furtwängler gave in Cologne [...] Furtwängler's performance of the Schumann's Fourth, which I didn't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> opened up a new world for me. I was deeply impressed. I didn't want to forget this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.|$|E

2500|$|Well {{before he}} finally sought {{treatment}} for alcoholism, Mantle admitted that his hard living had hurt both his playing and his family. His rationale {{was that the}} men in his family had all died young, so he expected to die young as well. His father died of Hodgkin's disease at age 40 in 1952, and his grandfather also died young of the same disease. [...] "I'm not gonna be cheated", he would say. Mantle did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{that most of the}} men in his family had inhaled lead and zinc dust in the mines, which contribute to Hodgkins' and other cancers. As the years passed, and he outlived all the men in his family by several years, he frequently used a line popularized by football legend Bobby Layne, a Dallas neighbor and friend of Mantle's who also died in part due to alcohol abuse: [...] "If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I'd have taken a lot better care of myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year, vocalist and guitarist Arie {{as well as}} bassist Remy quit the band. According to Bart this {{decision}} was influenced by several factors; [...] "I had wanted to bring in someone into the band for vocals {{all the way back}} in 2001, this was not possible at the time as some ex-members of the band felt that it would diminish their importance or feel threatened." [...] He added, [...] "...you see, back in 2002, we weren't expecting all this to happen a month before recording - and to have to write {{the other half of the}} album in 4 weeks... if there had been no changes at all, we would have had to deal with similar issues anyway. That's because, little did we <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the other guitarist had only one song ready a month before studio (despite telling us he had material for four songs) so either way we would have had four weeks to write the rest of the album. Maybe he chose to deal with it by leaving the band, I don't know and I don't really care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production on Schneemann's work Eye Body {{began in}} 1963. [...] Schneemann created a [...] "loft environment" [...] filled with broken mirrors, {{motorized}} umbrellas, and rhythmic color units. [...] To become {{a piece of}} the art herself, Schneemann covered herself in various materials including grease, chalk, and plastic. [...] She created 36 [...] "transformative-actions" [...] - photographs by Icelandic artist Erró of herself in her constructed environment. [...] Included in these images is a frontal nude featuring two garden snakes crawling on Schneemann's torso. [...] This image drew particular attention both for its [...] "archaic eroticism" [...] and her visible clitoris. [...] Schneemann claims that she did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the symbolism of the serpent in ancient cultures in figures such as the Minoan Snake Goddess and, in fact, learned of it years later. [...] Upon its presentation to the public in 1963, art critics found the piece to be lewd and pornographic. [...] Artist Valie Export notes Eye Body for the way in which Schneemann portrays [...] "how random fragments of her memory and personal elements of her environment are superimposed on her perception." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clark {{believes}} that he was punished not for his undisclosed arrest record, but for causing conflict with producers behind the scenes. According to Clark, after {{he made it to}} the twelve finalists' round, he and the other finalists were unduly pressured by producers to sign a contract, using one of two attorneys handpicked by the producers for representation, or be disqualified from the show. Clark and his fellow contestants' position was that having the producers select an attorney for them was a conflict of interest, a conclusion they reached with the advice of Abdul, who had told Clark, [...] "Look, if you can get six of your fellow contestants to stand up with you and say, 'We want our own attorney, we're not rolling with this stuff you want us to do,' they will not kick off the rest of the cast." [...] The other contestants decided to support him in standing up to producers, and consulted with Paula Abdul's lawyer, Howard Siegel, on Abdul's recommendation (though Clark maintains in his book that they did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that Siegel was one of Abdul's attorneys). Two weeks later, producers began asking Clark about his arrest record, and dismissed him from the show.|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. [...] I did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that we would {{get the chance to}} feast together." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, [...] "Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but I call him 'delicate'; this shows it." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} reports about {{what may have}} led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shot at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun even though during the trial Hesebeck admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. [...] Vang stated that race was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as [...] "chink" [...] and [...] "gook". On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a [...] "Hmong a--hole". Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term [...] "Mud Duck" [...] is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to [...] "Cheesehead" [...] being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, {{due to the fact that}} Willers and the others did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that Vang was from Minnesota.|$|E
