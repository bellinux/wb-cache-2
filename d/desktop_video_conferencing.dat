40|$|The big {{interest}} in <b>desktop</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> {{has led to}} a broad usage of multimedia tools in wide and local area networks. Many of these tools are based upon the IP multicast protocols. The general advantages of multicast services, like the efficient utilization of network resources and thus the possibility to reach arbitrary large numbers of receivers have by now rendered performance considerations of multicast protocols obsolete. Yet, the rapid growth of multicast usage, especially in the IP Internet, may lead to severe congestion problems, if performance trade-offs are not considered carefully in protocol design. In this paper we present performance investigations of the IP multicast architecture with special emphasis on routing protocols. Performance results derived from measurements and simulations will be discussed. Based upon these results, protocol improvements are suggested and evaluated. I.

40|$|Screen content coding (SCC) is {{becoming}} increasingly important in various applications, such as <b>desktop</b> sharing, <b>video</b> <b>conferencing,</b> and remote education. When compared to natural camera- captured content, screen content has different characteristics, in particular sharper edges. In this paper, we propose a novel intra prediction scheme for screen content video. In the proposed scheme, bilinear interpolation in angular intra prediction in HEVC is selectively replaced by nearest-neighbor intra prediction to preserve the sharp edges in screen content video. We present three different variants of the proposed nearest neighbor prediction algorithm: two implicit methods where both the encoder, and the decoder derive whether to perform nearest neighbor prediction or not based on either (a) {{the sum of the}} absolute difference, or (b) the difference between the boundary pixels from which prediction is performed; and another variant where Rate-Distortion-Optimization (RDO) search is performed at the encoder {{to decide whether or not}} to use the nearest neighbor interpolation, and explicitly signaled to the decoder. We also discuss the various underlying trade-offs in terms of the complexity of the three variants. All the three proposed variants provide significant gains over HEVC, and simulation results show that average gains of 3. 3 % BD-bitrate in Intra-frame coding are achieved by the RDO variant for screen content video. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that 1) points out current HEVC intra prediction scheme with bilinear interpolation does not work efficiently for screen content video and 2) uses different filters adaptively in the HEVC intra prediction interpolation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{obstacles}} facing designers of <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems {{is the problem of}} ameliorating the effects of congestion on interconnected packet-switched networks that do not support real-time communication. We present a framework for transmission control that describes the current network environment as a set of sustainable bit and packet transmission-rate combinations and show that adaptively scaling both the bit and packet-rate of the audio and video streams can reduce the impact of congestion. We empirically demonstrate the validity of adapting both packet and bit-rate using a simple feedback mechanism and simple adaptation heuristics to deliver audio and video streams suitable for low-latency, high-fidelity playout. 1.

40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) A <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> is an {{interactive}} meeting between {{two or more}} locations, facilitated by simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. People in a <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> also known as participants, join these <b>video</b> <b>conferences</b> for business and recreational purposes. In a typical <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> we should properly identify and authenticate every participant in the <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> if information discussed during the <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> is confidential. This prevents unauthorized and unwanted people from {{being part of the}} conference and exposing any confidential information during the <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> Present existing <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems however, have problems in this area, resulting in some risks. These risks relate precisely to the lack of facilities to properly identify and authenticate participants, making it possible for unwanted/unauthorised participants to join the conference or masquerade as another participant. It is especially a problem, when facilitators or organisers are the only participants that know the authorised participants, or participants allowed in a <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> In this dissertation, we review the risks that are present in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing,</b> and create a security system, (called BioVid) that mitigates the identification and authentication risks in <b>video</b> <b>conferences.</b> BioVid uses a Speeded-Up Robust Features or SURF-based face recognition approach, to identify and authenticate any participant in a <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> BioVid continuously monitors the participants to check if masquerading has occurred and when it does detect an unauthorised participant, it informs the Service Provider.
