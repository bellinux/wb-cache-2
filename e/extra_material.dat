Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – {{as well as}} Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake.

5|$|Bleach {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, {{but failed to}} chart in the U.S. upon its original release. The album was re-released internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the success of Nirvana's second album, Nevermind (1991). The re-release debuted at number 89 on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart and 34 on the Australian albums chart. In 2009 Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of Bleach featuring a live recording of a Nirvana show in Portland, Oregon from 1990 as <b>extra</b> <b>material.</b> Since its release in 1989, Bleach {{has sold more than}} 1,900,000 copies in the United States alone. It is Sub Pop's best-selling album to date. It was also their only album to feature drummer Chad Channing.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode, {{which was}} filmed {{over a period}} of 21 days, served as the basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that {{there was no room for}} Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|In January 2014, {{all four}} studio albums plus To See the Lights were reissued in double disc deluxe editions {{containing}} <b>extra</b> <b>materials</b> (demos, out-takes, radio versions and live).

50|$|In November 2003, the {{videotape}} compilation {{was released in}} DVD format, titled Duran Duran: Greatest — The DVD, with hidden <b>extra</b> <b>materials,</b> including alternative versions {{of some of the}} videos and interviews of the band, however, this version is much criticised for its extensive use of easter egg features, which make it difficult to find and play some materials.|$|R
25|$|The {{restored}} version {{also was}} made with combined subtitles in Danish and English. <b>Extra</b> <b>material</b> on the DVD included the two-minute alternative ending originally filmed for Russian audiences and the 15-minute surviving fragment of August Blom’s and Holger-Madsen’s 1914 film Liebelei.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2007, {{all three}} Darkman films were {{released}} {{in a box}} set by Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

25|$|Thermonuclear explosions by {{providing}} <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> for electrical conduction {{and a very}} turbulent localized atmosphere, have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud. In addition, intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through Compton scattering.

5000|$|From a funding perspective, [...] {{is often}} more {{expensive}} than acceleration.

40|$|The main {{conclusion}} is that publishers and repositories have the building blocks and the tools, but in general do not use them to create an Enhanced Publication for all three information categories.

25|$|Most {{testicular}} {{germ cell}} tumors {{have too many}} chromosomes, and most often they are triploid to tetraploid. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 {{on both sides of}} the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, Photoplay Productions {{restored}} the Museum of Modern Art's 35mm print {{that was the}} source of Shepard's 16mm print, though they also augmented it with <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> from the British Film Institute. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on Channel 4 television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.|$|E
25|$|The BBC issued CDs of the {{surviving}} 74 radio episodes in six box sets, one per series, with the sixth box containing several out-of-series specials. This {{was followed by the}} release of one large box set containing all the others in a special presentation case; while it includes no <b>extra</b> <b>material,</b> the larger box alone (without any CDs) still fetches high prices on online marketplaces like eBay, where Hancock memorabilia remains a thriving industry. There have also been VHS video releases of the BBC TV series.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Wood and {{publisher}} Larry Young emphasized the single-issue aspect of Demo, {{suggesting that the}} series would probably not be collected into a trade paperback. AiT/Planet Lar, generally seen as a publisher of graphic novels, held up Demo as proof {{that it had not}} abandoned the monthly-pamphlet format. However, the series was collected in 2005, minus the <b>extra</b> <b>materials</b> originally presented with the single issues.|$|R

In September 2015, the independent music company Wienerworld released The Man, The Music, a documentary on Hackett's career that went to No. 5 on the UK DVD chart. That October, Universal/Virgin released Premonitions: The Charisma Years 1975–1983, a 14-disc box set of his first six studio albums with <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> including live recordings and new remixes by Steven Wilson.|$|E
25|$|A small {{percentage}} of cases occur when {{only some of the}} body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called mosaic Edwards syndrome. Very rarely, a piece of chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus <b>extra</b> <b>material</b> from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical Edwards syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{original}} Mega Man and Mega Man 2 {{as the main}} inspiration for the gameplay in Mega Man 9, several significant features from previous games were left out. Specifically, Mega Man lacks the ability to slide along {{the ground and the}} ability to charge up his Mega Buster for more powerful shots. Aside from using or omitting various elements from past games in the series, Mega Man 9 introduces a time attack mode and 50 optional challenges where certain requirements should be met to be accomplished. These range from defeating a boss using only the Mega Buster to clearing the entire game without taking any damage. Downloadable content for all three versions of the game was made available for purchase during October 2008. Proto Man can be downloaded as an alternate playable character. Proto Man is able to slide, can charge up his buster, and takes double the damage of Mega Man, among other differences. Additional downloadable add-ons include higher difficulty modes, an endless stage, and a special stage featuring a new boss, Fake Man. In the later release of the game as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of having actual DLC, completing the game or entering the secret code at the Mega Man 9 title screen is the new requirement to unlock to acquire the former DLC <b>extra</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

It contains several documentaries, soundtrack commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, the 2005 unrated version, and {{the original}} 2004 theatrical version.|$|R
