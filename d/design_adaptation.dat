40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for the <b>design</b> of <b>adaptation</b> {{algorithms}} that guarantees a certain prescribed {{level of performance}} and applicable to systems with nonconvex parameterization. The main idea behind the method is two-fold. First, we augment the tuning error function and <b>design</b> the <b>adaptation</b> scheme {{in the form of}} ordinary differential equations. The resulting augmentation is allowed to depend on state derivatives. Second, we find a suitable realization of the <b>designed</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme in an algebraic-integral form. Due to their explicit dependence {{on the state of the}} original system, such adaptation schemes are referred to as adaptive algorithms in finite form, in contrast to (conventional) algorithms in differential form. Sufficient conditions for the existence of finite form realizations are proposed. It is shown that our method to design algorithms in finite form is applicable to a broad class of nonlinear systems including systems with nonconvex parameterization and low-triangular systems...|$|R

The usability design principles transparency, controllability, and consistency have been recommended {{for the design of}} adaptive interfaces. However, designing self-adaptive applications that may act completely autonomous is still a challenging task because there is no set of usability design guidelines. Applying the three principles {{in the design of the}} five different adaptations of the mobile adaptive application Meet-U revealed as difficult. Based on an analysis of the design problem space, we elaborate an approach for the <b>design</b> of usable <b>adaptations.</b> Our approach is based on a notification design concept which calculates the attention costs and utility benefits of notified adaptations by varying the design aspects transparency and controllability.
