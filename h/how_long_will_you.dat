[...] Moses is unloved and barely tolerated by his own people (in stark contrast to their adoration of his brother), and is constantly upbraided by God for every remark [...] which casts the Children of Israel in a negative light. [...] For example, the Israelites attack Moses for having taken them out of Egypt, and threaten his life, but when Moses reports to God this deteriorating situation, the response is: [...] "Moses, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> continue to defame my children?" ...|$|E

At any rate, it is a comfort to think that you won't be {{absolutely}} alone, especially among people whose language you don't know. Mind, if you are sending letters to Count Piper, be sure you send a few lines, by the same messenger, to let me know how you are going on.

Indeed there was no reason connected with any business of his which might not be told, other than that special reason which was about to take him to London.

40|$|If {{a natural}} disaster, {{widespread}} {{outbreak of disease}} (such as pandemic influenza), or act of terrorism occurred, would you be prepared? Many questions come to mind when planning for disasters, such as “What do I pack? ” and “Where do I go? ” (The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the American Red Cross are excellent resources to help with family disaster planning.) However, few people include the protection and care of pets in their disaster preparedness plans. Please take the following steps to protect pets and other animals during an emergency. Disaster Preparedness Planning 1. Create a disaster preparedness plan for your family – including your pets. 2. Remember the “ 3 Ps ” of evacuation—Purses, Pills and Pets. You may not know <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> need to be gone; therefore, {{it is important that}} you take identification (a photo ID), cash, credit cards and medications. Assemble an animal care pack containing the following items: • Identification tags including owner contact information and current photos • Current medical and vaccination records. Make sure your pets are up-to-date on all vaccinations. • Extra bottles of daily medications or copies of prescriptions with current expiration date...|$|R

[...] "You will observe," [...] he says, [...] "1st, that the age of seven is that at which you may hope a longer life; 2d, that at twelve or thirteen you have lived a quarter of your life; at twenty-eight or twenty-nine you have lived half; at fifty more than three-quarters."

They blame Lord Treasurer for his {{slowness}} in turning people out; but I suppose he has his reasons. They still keep my neighbour Atterbury in suspense about the deanery of Christ Church,(10) which has been above six months vacant, and he is heartily angry.

6000|$|Next morning brought good news--our trunks {{had arrived}} from Hamburg at last. Let {{this be a}} warning to the reader. The Germans are very conscientious, and this trait makes them very particular. Therefore if you tell a German you want a thing done immediately, he takes you at your word; he thinks you mean what you say; so he does that thing immediately--according to his idea of immediately--which is about a week; that is, it is a week if {{it refers to the}} {{building}} of a garment, or it is {{an hour and a half}} if it refers to the cooking of a trout. Very well; if you tell a German to send your trunk to you by [...] "slow freight," [...] he takes you at your word; he sends it by [...] "slow freight," [...] and you cannot imagine <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> go on enlarging your admiration of the expressiveness of that phrase in the German tongue, before you get that trunk. The hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful, when I got it ready for shipment in Hamburg; it was baldheaded when it reached Heidelberg. However, it was still sound, that was a comfort, it was not battered in the least; the baggagemen seemed to be conscientiously careful, in Germany, of the baggage entrusted to their hands. There was nothing now in the way of our departure, therefore we set about our preparations.|$|R
