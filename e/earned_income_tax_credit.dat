5|$|Among Kefalas' top {{priorities}} is restoring and expanding Colorado's <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> a move which met with resistance from legislative leaders in 2007 due to budget constraints.

5|$|Bradley {{also made}} child poverty a {{significant}} issue in his campaign. He promised {{to address the}} minimum wage, expand the <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Credit,</b> allow single parents on welfare to keep their child support payments, make the Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, build support homes for pregnant teenagers, enroll 400,000 more children in Head Start, and increase the availability of food stamps.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, 1993, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Brady Bill, which {{mandated}} federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998.

50|$|Thus, {{based on}} a pay check of 100, 63.42/131.42 (i.e., 48.3%) is paid as taxes, {{although}} the employer's contribution is a fee for the employee's adherence to the Swedish social security scheme.

30|$|To solve both {{of these}} problems, youth {{unemployment}} and older workers unemployment, countries need to adopt different methods. Creating more jobs will help young people enter the labor market. Creating differential levels for the minimum wage and supplementing the income of older workers with <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> will help older people re-enter the job market.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, {{the issue}} of adult {{unemployment}} requires a different solution {{due to the fact}} that their chances of finding a job are related specifically to their age. One solution might be a differential minimum wage for older and younger individuals and <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> (EITC) 9 for older individuals, as Malul and Luski (2009) suggested.|$|R
5|$|Kefalas also {{sponsored}} {{legislation to}} create an Economic Opportunity/Poverty Reduction Task Force, which he chaired following the regular session. The committee's objective is to develop plans to reduce Colorado's poverty rate by half in ten years, examining {{a broad range of}} issues from economic development to education to transportation to tax policy, and it considered potential legislation on topics ranging from the <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> to rent control.|$|E

40|$|Alongside {{the growth}} in overall {{employment}} and the steady rise in average real incomes over the 1990 s, many developed countries experienced a concentration of low labour market attachment and low pay among certain groups in society.

500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b> The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E
500|$|During Baker's {{first two}} years as governor, the state income tax has dropped to 5.1%. Baker has opposed {{implementing}} a [...] "millionaire's tax," [...] vetoed a vehicle miles traveled tax, originally supported but then opposed extending the state hotel tax to short-term rentals (such as Airbnb), favored a ballot measure that repealed indexing the state gas tax to inflation, signed into law {{an expansion of the}} state <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> opposed the 2016 ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana with a 3.75% excise tax levied on sales of marijuana products, and signed into law a six-month delay in the issuance of licenses for retailing marijuana in shops. In 2016, the Massachusetts general fund budget rose by 6.1 percent and the state budget for the 2016 fiscal year had a year-end shortfall of more than $300 million and could be as large $750 million for the following year. In December 2016, Baker unilaterally cut $98 million from the state budget, including many of the $265 million in items that he had vetoed the previous July, $231 million of which the state legislature overrode. The midyear cuts prompted criticism and opposition from State House of Representatives Speaker Robert DeLeo, State Senate President Stan Rosenberg, and State Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Karen Spilka. However, in February 2017, tax revenues came in 9.1 percent lower than expected and the likelihood of overturning the cuts became unlikely, and in March 2017, Speaker DeLeo stated that reversing those midyear cuts would be [...] "difficult." ...|$|E

We set up a theoretical model where both unemployment benefits and EITCs influence wages through their effects on the net (after-tax) replacement rate for the unemployed.

2500|$|A {{refundable}} {{tax credit}} is a mechanism whereby {{the tax system}} can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include the <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> and the additional child tax credit in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. [...] This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).|$|E

30|$|In this {{research}} {{we show that}} workers aged 30 – 44 {{were significantly more likely}} than those aged 45 – 59 to find a job a year after being unemployed. The main contribution is demonstrating empirically that since older workers’ difficulties are related to their age, while for younger individuals the difficulties are more related to the business cycle, policy makers must devise different programs to address unemployment among young and older individuals. The solution to youth unemployment is the creation of more jobs, and combining differential minimum wage levels and <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> might improve the rate of employment for older individuals.|$|R
40|$|Over recent years, several {{developed}} countries have implemented <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> {{in order to}} encourage welfare recipients to move into work. Here, we investigate the impact of ‘Working Credits', which increased the incentives for welfare recipients to work, but only for a temporary period. Using differences-in-differences and regression-adjusted differences-in-differences, we find evidence that the introduction of the Working Credit increased employment rates, earnings and exits for those on income support. Results from matched differences-in-differences are less precise, but generally consistent with the other two empirical strategies. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that on a cost-per-job basis, the Working Credit compares favourably with existing labour market programs. ...|$|R
