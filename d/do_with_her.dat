5|$|She worked {{steadily}} for {{the next}} two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.|$|E

Although nothing came of these plans, and Blount had little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son's upbringing, the fact that she was the mother of such an important child made her an object of interest to many of her contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|During {{his first}} police interview, Hodgson denied {{having an affair}} with Nicholl and also denied {{anything}} to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was switched on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to believe that she was alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as Carlisle in Cumbria and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to Hudswell. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier.|$|E
