5|$|Alex Trebek {{has served}} as host of the daily {{syndicated}} version since it premiered in 1984, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool's joke on the episode aired April 1, 1997. His most recent contract renewal, from May 2017, takes his tenure through the 2019–2020 season. In the daily syndicated version's first pilot, from 1983, Jay Stewart served as the show's announcer, but Johnny Gilbert took over the role when that version was picked up as a series and has held it since then.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, {{he became a}} Chetnik leader in Herzegovina and joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Jevđević collaborated with the Italians and later the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans. Although Jevđević recognised the authority of Mihailović, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, {{a number of factors}} effectively rendered him independent of Mihailović's command, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> worked closely with Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin, Mihailović's designated commander in Dalmatia, Herzegovina, western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E

25|$|For years, Turner {{has engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of intimidation against public officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner’s arrest in this case failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation against a key witness in the government’s case against him. All the while, Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his innumerable victims – that is, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{is the victim of}} a perceived threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in witness intimidation, lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|The {{show was}} {{presented}} in the United States and Canada on the Food Network, dubbed and/or subtitled into English. It is also actively broadcast on SBS TV in Australia. In the case of SBS this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling. It may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps {{by the fact that}} in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed. However, episodes aired since February 2009 have seen the Chairman's voice dubbed rather than subtitled {{as was the case in}} previous airings, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sends the chefs into battle.|$|E
25|$|Pigot {{engaged the}} vessels for an hour, and after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and {{captured}} Golden Grove. The British then captured {{the other two}} vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired {{on a group of}} 100 militia and a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to his head and one to a leg. Spanish casualties were reportedly 25 men killed (including five Americans) and 22 men wounded. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle. Pigot was unable to extricate himself and his prizes from the river until 21 July, but during the entire period he remained in command <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was getting his wounds dressed. For his efforts Pigot received a promotion to commander, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded him a medal and a plate worth £50.|$|E
5000|$|His {{file card}} {{states that he}} [...] "freaks people out. He's always clumsy, jittery, and {{dropping}} things <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> working with high explosives. Explosives are {{the only things that}} calm him down". This source of humor is played up in the comics (see below).|$|R
6000|$|... "He got up {{and went}} out at eight this morning,--got {{up in the middle of}} the night, by Jove! a thing <b>he</b> never does <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> on service.

500|$|Another {{appearance}} of the walrus in literature is in the story [...] "The White Seal" [...] in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, where it is the [...] "old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is asleep".|$|E
2500|$|According {{to another}} story, pulque was {{discovered}} by the Tlacuache [...] (opossum), who used his human-like hands to dig into the maguey and extract the naturally fermenting juice. He became the first drunk. Tlacuache was thought to set the course of rivers. [...] The rivers he set were generally straight <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was drunk. Then they follow Tlacuache's meandering path from cantina to cantina.|$|E
2500|$|Amphitrite, [...] "the {{third one}} who encircles [...] ", was so entirely {{confined}} in her {{authority to the}} sea and the creatures in it that she was almost never associated with her husband, either for purposes of worship or in works of art, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was to be distinctly regarded as the god who controlled the sea. An exception may be the cult image of Amphitrite that Pausanias saw in the temple of Poseidon at the Isthmus of Corinth (ii.1.7).|$|E
60|$|Now when Jimmy Skunk is angry, he doesn't {{bite and}} he doesn't scratch. You know Old Mother Nature has {{provided}} him with a little bag of perfume which Jimmy doesn't object to in the least, but which makes most people want to hold their noses and run. He never uses it, <b>excepting</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is angry or in danger, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> does use it, his enemies always turn tail and run. That is why he is afraid of no one, and why every one respects Jimmy and his rights.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} of Itzamnaaj Bʻalam's early life <b>except</b> that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was eleven years old one of his {{siblings}} participated in a war that involved Pacal, the famous king of Palenque.|$|R
50|$|Mamoru Kagemori is a plain {{boy with}} disheveled hair and thick glasses, which are {{actually}} a disguise. He {{is the son}} of a ninja family which has been protecting the Konnyaku family for 400 years. He reveals his true self (without glasses) <b>when</b> <b>he</b> transforms into a ninja to protect Yūna from harm and is very lazy <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> saving Yūna. He has been friends with Yūna since they were children, and has also been in the same class as her since kindergarten. He has a fear of bears, which developed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tried to protect Yamame from a bear when they were children. His name: Mamoru, means protect in Japanese.|$|R
2500|$|During {{dangerous}} missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy {{to get out}} of the way so he can get to {{the escape}} hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him, infuriating Yossarian even more, and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts, Aarfy never can hear him (<b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> says [...] "never mind"). On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy, but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up, leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless.|$|E
2500|$|Aarfy {{helps to}} protect women with social {{connections}} from the sexual advances {{of the other}} officers, much to their dismay, hoping that these connections will later be of use. Unlike the other officers, Aarfy {{is not willing to}} pay for sex with a prostitute, but perversely he has no regrets when he rapes and murders the innocent maid Michaela; when asked by Yossarian why he didn't simply hire a prostitute, he repeats his common admonition that [...] "Old Aarfy has never paid for it", and shows no remorse <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> begins to fear that he may be brought to justice.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a family}} started and the {{security}} of Steve Roper, in 1954 Overgard and his wife Gloria [...] "left behind their bohemian Manhattan life" [...] (Traster 2007) and moved up the Hudson to a house on a rural [...] site in Stony Point, NY, close to friend Caniff's home. He invested much of his earnings {{over the years in}} renovating the house (built in 1770) while also indulging a love of antique cars and motorcycles. He did his cartooning and writing at night, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and his wife entertained in [...] "artsy soirees" [...] in their home and gardens (Traster, ibid).|$|E
50|$|Kenard {{is usually}} {{seen in the}} {{background}} playing in Hamsterdam. Other than {{that he is not}} seen that much, <b>except</b> for <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is seen fighting with another kid over who gets to play Omar Little next.|$|R

According to Nanny Ogg's Cookbook he has been granted the Order of the Lancrastian Empire. He is also notable for inventing small and almost pointless devices including the Lancrastian Army Knife which includes such attachments as [...] "A Device for locating things that are lost" [...] and [...] "A Device to Remove the fundamental point from any argument".|$|R
50|$|An All-Star in 1948, Dobson {{enjoyed his}} best {{years with the}} Red Sox. Between 1941 and 1950 (<b>excepting</b> 1944-45, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> served in the United States Army during World War II), he won 106 games for the Red Sox.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the offense}} was in {{reference}} to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was raised by the court. If, however, the excommunicate {{showed no sign of}} penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the [...] "herem," [...] the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in need of the bare necessities of life.|$|E
2500|$|After the Royalty {{closed for}} the summer in June 1875, Fred Sullivan toured with Dolaro's company, {{performing}} in operettas, playing the Viceroy in La Périchole and Pomponnet in Lecocq’s La fille de Madame Angot, {{as well as the}} Judge in Trial. [...] He was back at the Royalty Theatre when it reopened for the autumn season, again playing the Judge, and continued in the role when the show opened at the Opera Comique beginning in January 1876, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> played the role in a few matinee performances at the Gaiety Theatre. [...] In March 1876, W. S. Penley replaced Sullivan as the Judge for several performances when Sullivan was too ill to play the role because of his worsening tuberculosis. [...] Sullivan was, however, able to resume the role until the production closed in May. [...] From May to October, Emily Soldene's company played Trial on tour with Sullivan as the Judge, {{but at the end of}} the tour his declining health forced him to retire.|$|E
2500|$|Even before {{completing}} his studies, Fancourt {{was building a}} concert career in London, the British provinces and the European continent. The Times said of an Aeolian Hall recital in 1912, [...] "Mr. Fancourt has some noble notes in his voice, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> forces it occasionally ... Schubert's Tod und das Mädchen was remarkably well characterized; it was quite his best and he made it into a thing of great beauty." [...] In World War I, Fancourt volunteered for military service and was commissioned in the London Regiment as a lieutenant. In 1917, while still serving in the army, Fancourt married a beautiful Welsh singer, Eleanor Evans, at St Mark's Church, Hamilton Terrace, London. She had been a fellow student at the Royal Academy. After returning to civilian life in 1919, Fancourt sang in a single performance of Prince Igor in Sir Thomas Beecham's opera season at Covent Garden as Prince Galitsky under the baton of Albert Coates. This was his only professional appearance in a grand opera, and his only paid acting experience up to that point. In the same year, he appeared as a soloist at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts and in oratorio elsewhere in London.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the last}} Urmuzian works to be {{discovered}} is [...] "Cotadi and Dragomir". The first in the duo is a muscular but short and insect-like merchant, who wears dandruff, tortoiseshell combs, a lath armor which greatly hiders his movements, and a piano lid screwed to his buttocks. The descendant of Macedonian nobility, Cotadi feeds on ant eggs and excretes soda water, <b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> corks himself to solve the [...] "agrarian question". For fun, he lures his clients into angry conversations—these end with him banging the piano lid, {{which is also a}} urinating wall, on the shop's floor. Dragomir is long, crooked, brownish and kind-hearted; he intervenes in the disputes between Cotadi and the more stubborn customers, imposing respect with his main prop: a cardboard contraption that extends upwards from his neck. Cotadi rewards such attentions with servings of octopus, sorb-pears and paint, granting Dragomir the right to nest inside his gate wall. They plan to be buried together, [...] "in the same hole", with French oil as a daily supply. From such an oily grave, Cotadi hopes, an olive tree plantation may spring up, to benefit of his descendants. Like [...] "Algazy & Grummer", [...] "Cotadi and Dragomir" [...] can be read as alluding to the triteness of business life.|$|E

They've {{been married for}} fifteen years, and haven't had sex {{with each other for}} thirteen of them. The marriage is a front {{for the sake of the}} pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted - maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too - Prince - an Alsatian...Pearl met Jack at school, and they were sweethearts from the word go. Money and things are what interest her. Jack didn't give her these fast enough in the early stages of their marriage, which is partly why it turned sour.

5000|$|In {{the seventh}} season, Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of the morality of Rick and Tara raiding Oceanside. He assessed, [...] "...we are forcibly reminded of The Walking Deads greatest weakness: Rick Must Always Be Right (<b>except</b> <b>when</b> <b>he’s</b> trying to fight against his destiny as a leader). The people of Oceanside almost immediately lose what little distinctive identity they once had, falling in line like they were just waiting for some bearded dude {{to show up and}} start ordering them around, and there’s no acknowledgement of the weirdness of this, of how close Rick’s tactics are to the very man he’s trying to destroy".|$|R

[...] Brian McDermott kept an eye on him for roughly 18 months, and had seen him in action a number of times.
