To apply these superior properties to <b>functional</b> <b>packaging,</b> polyurushiol (YPUOH) powders were prepared and blended into LDPE (low density poly-ethylene) to prepare three different LDPE/YPUOH composite films via a twin screw extruder system.

Due to the good antibacterial property of as-prepared YPUOH, LDPE/YUOH composite films also showed an excellent antibacterial activity (R) of 99. 9 % against E. coli. Furthermore, the moisture barrier property of LDPE/YPUOH composite films increased with increasing YPUOH contents.

Interfacial adhesion between the matrix polymer and the zeolite is not very strong, although quantitative determination is hampered by various factors.

The subsequent oxidation of 1 with a ferricinium salt ([Fc]+[BF 4]−) gives the mixed valence compound [{Cp*Ru} 2 Ic′]+[BF 4]− (1 +). Compound 1 was structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography, finding that both {Cp*Ru} fragments are coordinated to opposite {{sites of the}} Ic′ ligand. The structural and electronic features of 1 and 1 + have been rationalized by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest that both metallic centers {{get closer to the}} Ic′ and subtle electronic reorganizations occurs when chemical oxidation takes place. Cyclic voltammetry and ESR experiments suggest a high electronic interaction between the metallic centers mediated by the Ic′ bridging ligand. Time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out to understand and assign the intervalence band present in the mixed-valent specie (1 +). The main achievement {{of this article is to}} feature the relationship of the experimental data with the computational results obtained with the Amsterdam Density <b>Functional</b> <b>package</b> (ADF).

The FTS approach {{is well suited}} for the combined requirement of ultra-high accuracy and broad spectral coverage at high spectral resolution. FTS technology inherently provides broad spectral coverage with {{a small number of}} detectors, a very well defined instrument line shape (ILS) that can be easily monitored and measured, and the spectral resolution required for accurate line shape and position determination and to accurately calibrate the spectral scale using well-known atmospheric absorption lines. The challenge in the IR FTS sensor development for a climate benchmark measurement mission is to achieve this ultra-high accuracy with a design that can be flight qualified, has long design life, and is reasonably small, simple, and affordable. In this area, our approach is to make use of components with strong spaceflight heritage (direct analogs with high TRL) combined into a <b>functional</b> <b>package</b> for detailed performance testing.

40|$|The density <b>functional</b> <b>package</b> DeFT is {{used for}} systems {{with a large number}} of charge distributions, and the {{bottleneck}} of the computation is the evaluation of two-electron integrals. Previously, it scaled quadratically with system size. A particular strategy, called the continuous fast multipole method, has been implemented in DeFT and combined with traditional methods for evaluating the two-electron integrals. The result is a code which scales linearly with system size and is able to treat larger systems. The Continuous Fast Multipole Method (CFMM) uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to approximate the pairwise potentials between continuous charge distributions. Pairwise potentials are computed using the direct method if they are within a defined distance of one another; and are approximated by a multipolar expansion if they are not. The algorithm involves successive subdivisions of the simulation space until the desired precision is reached, which reduces the number of pairwise potentials evaluated. For large systems, this algorithm scales linearly with the number of charge distributions. Enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions have many applications in biological systems. It has been shown in previous investigations that phosphoryl transfer in enzymes proceeds via a pentacoordinate phosphorus intermediate. Few theoretical investigations have been conducted on this class of enzymes due to the large number of atoms treated quantum mechanically. In this investigation, models of the pentacoordinate phosphorus intermediate are investigated with density functional methods. Comparison of the results of calculations using the VSXC functional with experiment and perturbation theory are employed to validate its use in investigations of phosphoryl transfer reactions...|$|E

Scientists may decide to change the distribution and ratio of core samples to rock samples in the canister. The long distance and duration of this planetary mission places a reliability burden on the hardware.

The use of this material in <b>functional</b> <b>packaging</b> is currently under investigation. Preliminary data on the binding of heavy metals and adsorption of model organic dyes encourage exploring the potential of activated SCG as an active component of filtering membranes...|$|R

40|$|The vibronic {{coupling}} {{effect and}} double excitations were studied using time-dependent density functional response theory (TDDFRT). The density function calculations were performed using {{a modified version}} of the Amsterdam density <b>functional</b> (ADF) <b>package.</b> A combination of statistical averaging of orbital potentials (SAOP) and TDDFRT calculations was found to be efficient in the qualitative simulation of vibronic structure of larger molecules. The vibronic coupling calculations showed that the shapes of adiabatic potential energy curves of the TDDFRT/SAOP calculations were satisfactory...|$|R
