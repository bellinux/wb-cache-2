Advantages over other applicable approaches are discussed.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of real-time microfocus radiography are evaluated for several applications. These advantages are mainly the small focal spot size (5 mum) {{leading to a}} very low <b>geometrical</b> <b>unsharpness</b> (0. 1 mm) for a magnification of 21 x; the positioning of the specimen {{very close to the}} source (15 mm) leading to high magnifications (100 x) and the minimal scattered radiation recorded on film. This radiographic technique was used to study the electrolytic codeposition of a Cu-layer on a metal substrate. Enlarged radiographic images of archaeological findings revealed the smallest detail. This helps in the restoration of pieces contaminated outside and remaining intact inside. For medical research microfocus X-ray radiography provided useful information on the reaction of bone tissue on specific osteoporosis medication, on the vascular changes in experimentally induced liver tumours and on the sequential deterioration of kidney stones. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComputer {{modelling}} of {{non-destructive testing}} methods {{has come a}} long way from the beginnings in the mid 90 s to today. In this article we review radiographic modelling from the perspective of two important application domains with very different requirements, nuclear and aerospace. Radiographic modelling for components with higher wall thicknesses, as they are typical for nuclear applications, must include precise predictions of scattered radiation and its impact in terms of contrast reduction. Dedicated or general purpose Monte Carlo methods with the ability to calculate higher order scattering events are the state of the art for these applications. The challenge here is to obtain the simulation results in reasonable computation time, and a number of acceleration schemes have been devised to that end. Aerospace applications, on the other hand, have stronger requirements on the modelling code's capabilities to import complex CAD geometries, and can benefit from faster analytical scatter models, limited to first or second order scattering events. Similar distinctions can be made for the various approaches proposed to accurately model <b>geometrical</b> and film <b>unsharpness,</b> film granularity, film responses, film/foil cartridges and photon noise. With the advent of digital radiography, computer modelling faces new challenges to take physical effects into account which could be neglected with traditional silver films...|$|R
