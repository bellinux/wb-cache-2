Protein <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl</b> oyster meat (SPH) was added to myofibrils (Mf) from lizard fish at certain ratios 2. 5 – 12. 5 g/ 100 gr Mf, and {{the changes in the}} state of water in myofibrils associated with dehydration were analyzed on the basis a water sorption isotherm curve and isosteric sorption heat.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> in meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck. The meats of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native chicken, and local duck were used in this study. The meats were ground using food processor added with aquadest to obtain meat extract. The meat extracts were then hydrolyzed using protease enzymes to obtain <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> meat protein. Protein concentration of meat extract and <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> meat protein were determined, and were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{angiotensin}} I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for application in functional food, chicken bones were gathered from a meat processing factory and then hydrolyzed with Alcalase, pepsin and trypsin for 12 h. The hydrolysates were lyophilized, stored at - 80 degrees C and tested experimentally every 2 h for pH value, peptide content, degree of hydrolysis (DH), electrophoresis and activity of ACE inhibitor. The <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> Alcalase had the highest peptide content and DH. The components of more than 66 kDa had disappeared in <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> Alcalase and trypsin after 2 h <b>of</b> hydrolysis.

Collagen <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> S and C were {{prepared}} by enzymatic hydrolysis decalcified tilapia scale and pepsin-solubilised collagen extracted from decalcified tilapia scale. The antioxidative activity of C and S {{were evaluated by}} their effects on scavenging ability of superoxide anion O 2 - radicals, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and reductive ability in vivo. Besides, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in vitro of the laboratory mouse were detected. The results indicated that collagen <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> C and S show prominent inhibitory effect on scavenging O 2 - with the fifty-percent inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 3. 7 and 6. 5 mg/mL, respectively. The IC 50 <b>of</b> collagen <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> C and S inhibit the DPPH were 8. 4 and 7. 2 mg/mL, respectively. Two collagen hydrolysates demonstrated highly reducing activity.

The final goal {{of this study was}} to circumvent the detoxification process when the <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> lignocelluloisic biomass contained the toxic substances in high concentration. When six yeast strains were examined, Sacchromyces cerevisiae ATCC 96581 and Pichia stipitis CBS 7126 were relatively resistant to inhibitor cocktail. Then, using strains 96581 and 7126, we designed a process strategy for bioethanol production, assuming that the concentration of toxic substance in the <b>hydrolysate</b> <b>of</b> rape stem was remarkably high. When strains 96581 and 7126 were inoculated simultaneously, it was observed that strain 7126 produced bioethanol as well as strain 96581, although the concentration of inhibitor cocktail was 18. 2 % (v/v).

Transglutaminase activity was determined in fermentations on sorghum straw hydrolysates and commercial xylose with initial xylose 10, 20 or 30 g/L. Using media containing commercial xylose 20 g/L, transglutaminase activity up to 0. 282 U/mL was obtained in 96 h. Using neutralized, charcoal-treated <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> sorghum straw with xylose 30 g/L sterilized in autoclave at 121 °C, up to 0. 155 U/mL was obtained in 96 h.

The digestibility of SPI increased significantly (P < 0. 05) with pressurization following 10 min of pepsin digestion. The total peptide content in the pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysates was unaffected by pressurization; however, the peptide profiles were altered. Peptides from <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> pressurized SPI showed higher antioxidant activity than peptides from native SPI hydrolysates {{as measured by the}} FRAP assay.

For both 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and reducing power responses, the optimised conditions were achieved at an enzyme to substrate ratio (E/S, w/w) of 2. 22 %, hydrolysis time of 3. 60 h, and hydrolysis temperature of 45. 70 °C.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the nature of}} the diphtheria toxin fragment A recognition site in the protein synthesis translocating factor present in cell-free preparations from the archaebacteria Thermoplasma acidophilum and Halobacterium halobium. In agreement with earlier work (M. Kessel and F. Klink, Nature (London) 287 : 250 - 251, 1980), we found that extracts from these organisms contain a protein factor which is a substrate for the ADP-ribosylation reaction catalyzed by diphtheria toxin fragment A. However, the rate of the reaction was approximately 1, 000 times slower than that typically observed with eucaryotic elongation factor 2. We also demonstrated the presence of diphthine (the deamidated form of diphthamide, i. e., 2 -[3 -carboxyamide- 3 -(trimethylammonio) propyl]histidine) in acid <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> H. halobium protein in amounts comparable to those found in <b>hydrolysates</b> <b>of</b> similar preparations from eucaryotic cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and HeLa).
