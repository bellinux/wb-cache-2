5|$|Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest {{with the}} newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece of <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> <b>In</b> the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelačić's {{division}} was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. As the enemy became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti held puberty rites {{only for}} females. Fathers {{instruct}} their sons without public observance. The privacy of boys was respected in the Ashanti kingdom. As menstruation approaches, a girl {{goes to her}} mother's house. When the girl's menstruation is disclosed, the mother announces the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> the village beating an iron hoe with a stone.

25|$|Furthermore, {{the promise}} of {{competitive}} markets to lower consumer prices, for the most part, has yet to materialize. Data from the United States, for example, indicates that while Pennsylvania and Connecticut have fairly stable residential prices since restructuring, most other states have witnessed price increases after the year 2000. While this may be <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> terms of conservation and demand-side management (C) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier Ernie Eves, under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> is {{described}} <b>in</b> {{many different ways}} in the Bible. Each one reflects different emphases, and describes part {{or all of the}} Biblical narrative. Christian teaching of the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> — including the preaching of the Apostles in the Book of Acts — generally focuses upon the resurrection of Jesus and its implications. Sometimes in the Bible, the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> {{is described}} <b>in</b> other terms, but it still describes God's saving acts. For example, the Apostle Paul taught that the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> was announced to the patriarch Abraham in the words, [...] "All nations will be blessed through you." [...] (Galatians 3:6-9; c.f. Genesis 12:1-3).|$|R

25|$|Lawson began {{performing}} {{at a young}} age. When she was only five she sang at Feethams for soldiers wounded during the First World War and soon became a regular at Darlington's Scala theatre on Eldon Street. Lawson took on other roles and in 1920 she had a part in a Babes in the Wood panto. At {{the age of twelve}} she led a performing group of young girls that toured County Durham for three years. In addition to her pure acting ability, Lawson developed into exceptional dancer. In her mid-teens she landed a role in a panto in Brighton and later performed in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, where she was spotted by comedian Gracie Fields. With Fields's support, Lawson was able to become the resident act at The May Fair Hotel in London. Lawson incorporated into her show the song Varsity Drag from the musical Good News, which at the time was being performed by American Zelma O'Neal at the Carlton Theatre in the West End. Her performance was such a success that when O'Neal returned to the United States, the Carlton Theatre choose 17-year-old Lawson as her replacement. Lawson made her name on stage in 1928 at the Carlton in the role Flo in the production of <b>Good</b> <b>News.</b> <b>In</b> 1929, Lawson departed for Australia on a tour, where she appeared in the productions of The Desert Song and Hold Everything!.|$|E

40|$|This Study {{examines}} some cross-cultural {{differences in}} conveying <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> <b>in</b> Australian English and Vietnamese. Three major aspects {{are taken into}} consideration: address forms, modality, and directness-indirectness. Theoretical issues are raised and discussed, and questionnaire data collected and analysed. Chapter I shows why it is important and necessary to study crosscultural differences and sets up {{the aims of the}} study. Chapter II deals with address forms in general and the use of address forms in conveying <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> <b>in</b> the Australian and Vietnamese cultural contexts in particular [...] The similarities and differences between the two systems are also discussed. Chapter III dwells on modality and its devices: modals, modality markers, subjunctive mood (in English) and lexico-modal operators for subjunctive mood (in Vietnamese). The use of these devices in communicating <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> <b>in</b> the two cultures is discussed in detail. Chapter IV is concerned theoretically with directness-indirectness, and the relationship between indirectness and politeness. How directness and in-directness are actually used to convey <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> <b>in</b> Australian and Vietnamese cultures is also analysed. Chapter V concludes the Study and suggests implications for ELT...|$|R

2500|$|The passage {{continues}} {{by describing}} how Philip helped the Ethiopian treasurer understand {{a passage from}} the Book of Isaiah that the Ethiopian was reading. After Philip interpreted the passage as prophecy referring to Jesus Christ, the Ethiopian requested that Philip baptize him, and Philip did so.

2500|$|In 1971, a French journalist, Franklin Loufrani, {{created a}} smiley logo to mark <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>in</b> the French {{newspaper}} France Soir. Loufrani {{was the first}} person to trademark the symbol, in 1972. Later, in 1996, Loufrani established The Smiley Company with his son, Nicolas Loufrani. Nicolas developed hundreds of different emoticons, including 3D versions. His designs were registered at the United States Copyright Office in 1997, and appeared online as [...]gif files in 1998. These were the first graphical representations of the originally text-based emoticon. He published his icons as well as emoticons created by others, along with their ASCII versions, in an online Smiley Dictionary in the early 2000s. This dictionary included over 3,000 different Smileys and was published as a book called Dico Smileys in 2002. [...] The Smiley Company has trademarked its version of the smiley face in over 100 countries. [...] In 1997, The Smiley Company filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. [...] In 2001, Walmart opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990. [...] The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to widespread use of smiley face designs. [...] Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was [...] "readily distinguishable" [...] from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court. [...] The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently, and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{framework}} of how litigation risk affects management forecasting of bad <b>news</b> and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> differently, resulting <b>in</b> differential optimism in these forecasts. I argue that distinct stock price patterns following {{these two types of}} management forecasts expose them to differential litigation risk ex post. While optimistic management forecasts of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> attract lawsuits, truthful rather than optimistic forecasts of bad news are more likely to trigger immediate lawsuits. As a result, managers adjust the optimism <b>in</b> bad and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts differently to reduce litigation risk. Consistent with my hypotheses, I find that ex ante litigation risk increases the optimism <b>in</b> bad <b>news</b> management forecasts but does not change the optimism <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> management forecasts, and the optimism <b>in</b> bad <b>news</b> management forecasts is higher than that <b>in</b> their <b>good</b> <b>news</b> counterparts. <b>In</b> addition, I use RegFD as a natural setting to demonstrate how arguably exogenous shocks amplify this effect. It appears that litigation risk in the pre-RegFD period is not sufficient to affect management forecasting behavior, and my findings only exist in the post-RegFD period. Last, I present evidence that is consistent with investors correctly perceiving and responding to the relative bias in bad new and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> management forecasts...|$|R
