40|$|The article {{presents}} review of methods and devices for track measurement of rail vehicles in aspect of diagnostics {{and safety of}} use. Currently used solutions do not enable effective “on-line ” measurement of mileage by wheelsets and vehicles ’ axles in rail vehicles without electric power supply such as goods wagons and cisterns. Those solutions have limited functionality and have to use additional power sup-ply (accumulators, generators, etc.) which significantly increase exploitation costs. A telemetric system for monitoring of wheelsets ’ mileage {{as well as of}} their bearing temperature, based on original solution of odometer installed on the set’s <b>grease-box,</b> was suggested in the research. The odometer is powered from an independent source of energy generated through magnetic induction by coil and neodymium magnets. Reading of collected data is done {{with the help of a}} PDA equipped with an RFID reader as well as wired and wireless interfaces for data transmission to telemetric system and GPS...|$|E
