At the caves, Charlie searches through Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) medicine supply <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> ease his heroin withdrawal.

25|$|Anicca (impermanence): All {{conditioned}} phenomena {{are subject}} to change, including physical characteristics, qualities, assumptions, theories, knowledge, etc. Nothing is permanent, because, <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be permanent, {{there has to be}} an unchanging cause behind it. Since all causes are recursively bound together, there can be no ultimate unchanging cause.|$|E

25|$|Locationless/Reverse caches {{are similar}} to a {{scavenger}} hunt. A description is given <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates {{an example of this}} object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, he {{was given}} his first parish assignment, the obscure barrio of Banay-banay. He {{was told by the}} other priests not to stay long there because there was nothing much to do there, to which he replied “I will look <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do.” He visited {{practically}} every house in his parish, meeting with everyone in the process. Up to now, the people in the place which he served for two-and-a-half years remember the tall, kindly priest.|$|E

He hid the rifle in a green plastic bag under a sofa, went to a McDonald's <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat, and booked into a Days Inn for the night. He learned from CNN news reports that police had misidentified his vehicle and did not have his license plate number. The next morning, he took a flight to Quetta, Pakistan.|$|E

Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|According to International Relief and Development agency (IRD) {{director}} Derek Hammond, {{the areas}} around Adar contained [...] "Fields of destroyed crops with {{no evidence of}} any type of food, a handful of local people scratching around in a swamp <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat".|$|E

500|$|Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{described}} {{the writing process}} as, [...] "When we were writing this album I was looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> beat; I wanted something to beat, but nothing impresses me right now. Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, so I just {{had to come up}} with my own shit." [...] The album was produced by Rick Rubin and was recorded at Oceanway Studios.|$|E
500|$|On August 30, Smith {{commanded}} one of {{the most}} complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the Battle of Richmond. Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 Battle of Munfordville, but the delay there cost him the larger prize of Louisville, which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25. Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of Bardstown, Shelbyville and Danville and waited <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, a move that historian Kenneth W. Noe called a [...] "stupendously illogical decision." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The sun hadn't {{gone down}} yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen.

We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{schedule}} was tight for a complex production. The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode, which director Douglas Mackinnon says {{was the biggest}} challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot {{for most of the}} episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not [...] "being precious" [...] over his material during the editing process, and points out that his willingness to cut superfluous material means that he is taken seriously when he argues <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be retained.|$|E
500|$|Menken and Slater had {{originally}} intended for [...] "I See the Light" [...] to sound more [...] "anthem-like". The songwriters eventually changed their minds, deciding to re-write [...] "I See the Light" [...] into a gentler, more folk-oriented song. Menken {{spoke of the}} creative writing process, [...] "we began throwing melodies up, doing songs and riffs and harmonies, and we waited <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> stick". Additionally, Menken later admitted that, out of Tangleds five songs and musical numbers, he is most proud of [...] "I See the Light" [...] because it [...] "is a great moment in the film and I am {{very happy with the}} beauty and simplicity of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} EC, Kurtzman had overseen {{the first five}} Mad pocket books {{published}} by Ballantine Books, which became perennial sellers with sales in the millions. [...] When Kurtzman left EC, his royalties from the books ceased and Gaines had Kurtzman's name removed from them. [...] In 1958 Gaines abandoned Ballantine for Signet Books. [...] Kurtzman proposed an original paperback to Ian Ballantine, who was looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> replace the Mad line. [...] Kurtzman was well respected at the Ballantine offices, and it was editor Bernard Shir-Cliff who provided Kurtzman with the postcard of the gap-toothed character that was to become Mads mascot AlfredE. Neuman. [...] Ballantine had earlier published The Humbug Digest in the same format with material culled from Kurtzman's Humbug magazine, though it fared poorly in the market.|$|E
