5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E

5|$|<b>Guinea-Bissau</b> won its {{independence}} in 1974, {{the same year}} its national football federation, Federação de Futebol da Guiné-Bissau, was founded. The federation became a FIFA affiliate in 1986. Women's football is provided for in the constitution of Federação de Futebol da Guiné-Bissau, and the organisation has four full-time staff members focusing on it.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, few {{countries}} had women's national football teams. While the sport gained popularity worldwide {{in the ensuing}} years, Guinea-Bissau's team only began play {{more than two decades}} later. By the end of 2006, the team had played in two FIFA-recognised matches. The first was on 28 October 2006 against Guinea in Bissau, which ended in a 1-1 tie after <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> led 1-0 at half-time. On 12 November 2006, the team played in their second FIFA-recognised match in Conakry, where <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> lost to Guinea 1-3. At the time, the team held three training sessions a week. The team has not participated in some of the major international and regional football competitions, including the Women's World Cup, the 2010 African Women's Championship and the 2011 All-Africa Games.|$|E

5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, <b>Guinea-Bissau,</b> Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly widespread in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while it is rare in Niger and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and <b>Guinea-Bissau,</b> but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
5|$|Ship reports {{indicates}} that a tropical storm developed on September8 at 1200UTC, while located about 175miles (280km) east of the Bissagos Islands, <b>Guinea-Bissau.</b> The storm gradually strengthened as it was heading west-northward. By late on September9, the system strengthened into a hurricane. It passed southwest of Cape Verde on the following day. The storm then intensified slowly, becoming a Category2 hurricane early on September12. Around that time, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later on September12, it re-curved north-northwestward. After turning north-northeast, the storm began executing a small cyclonic loop on September14.|$|E
40|$|The {{military}} coup staged by <b>Guinea-Bissau’s</b> army {{on the evening}} of 12 April 2012 was a striking situation in which there seemed not to be any meaningful central grip that resulted from the political processes of the country. <b>Guinea-Bissau’s</b> recent history has four {{military coup}}s since independence from Portugal in 1974. The latest military coup {{was the result of the}} cooperation among military officers, and foreign and local drug barons. For the first time in Africa’s history, and in world history too, a country that was deemed by contemporary theories as a “failed”, a “weak” or a “collapsed” state started to be called a “narco state”. This essay aims at explaining why should the International community recognize <b>Guinea-Bissau’s</b> narco state as a legitimate new form of state...|$|R

5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Fred {{prompted}} a hurricane warning for Cape Verde {{for the first}} time ever and was the first storm to pass through the islands as a hurricane since 1892. Strong winds there left about $2.5million in damage. Two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port. Seven other sailors likely drowned offshore <b>Guinea-Bissau</b> after their fishing boat collapsed. Tropical storms Grace, Henri, and Ida left negligible impact on land. Hurricane Joaquin's intensity and slow movement in the vicinity of the Bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands. Additionally, the American cargo ship SS El Faro went missing near Crooked Island and eventually capsized during the storm, drowning 33people. Rough seas in Haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning. Joaquin was the most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non-tropical origins. The remnants of Kate affected the British Isles, particularly Wales in the United Kingdom. Throughout the season, these storms collectively caused at least $730.4million in damage and 89deaths.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. The bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, <b>Guinea-Bissau,</b> Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Reckless hunting and loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human settlement have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. The total populations of the bohor reedbuck are estimated to be above 100,000. Larger populations occur in eastern and central Africa than in western Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a lack of access to the warm waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in Bissau, <b>Guinea-Bissau.</b> As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from <b>Guinea-Bissau,</b> have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E
