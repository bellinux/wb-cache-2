50|$|The {{import prices}} for shrimp {{fluctuate}} wildly. In 2003, the import {{price per kilogram}} shrimp in the United States was US$8.80, slightly higher than in Japan at US$8.00. The average import price in the EU was only about US$5.00/kg; this much lower value is {{explained by the fact}} that the EU imports more coldwater shrimp (from catches) that are much smaller than the farmed warm water species, and thus attain lower prices. In addition, Mediterranean Europe prefers <b>head-on</b> <b>shrimp,</b> which weigh approximately 30% more, but have a lower unit price.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The U. S. shrimp farming {{industry}} has been expanding in the southern U. S. in response to strong market demand for shrimp. U. S. farmers have difficulty competing with imports in frozen shrimp commodity markets. This study identified the shrimp purchasing behavior and preferences of seafood wholesalers and retailers in nine southeastern U. S. states to provide shrimp farmers the market information needed to develop successful marketing strategies. Results of a mail survey, including a conjoint analysis experiment, of the seafood dealers are presented and discussed. There appears to be strong market potential for fresh, farm-raised shrimp {{in a variety of}} sizes, but there is considerable dealer resistance to the whole or live, <b>head-on</b> <b>shrimp</b> form. Shrimp farmers interested in successfully marketing to seafood dealers may be required to process their product in order to offer shrimp tails, rather than whole shrimp...|$|R

Average price of white shrimp is US$5.5/kg for a size range of 21/25 <b>shrimps</b> per <b>kg,</b> while for P. monodon it is US7-13/kg.

50|$|Extensive shrimp farms using {{traditional}} low-density methods are invariably {{located on a}} coast and often in mangrove areas. The ponds range from just a few to more than 100 hectares; shrimp are stocked at low densities (2-3 animals per square metre, or 25,000/ha). The tides provide for some water exchange, and the shrimp feed on naturally occurring organisms. In some areas, farmers even grow wild shrimp by just opening the gates and impounding wild larvae. Prevalent in poorer or less developed countries where land prices are low, extensive farms produce annual yields from 50 to 500 kg/ha of <b>shrimp</b> (<b>head-on</b> weight). They have low production costs (US$1-3/kg live shrimp), are not very labor-intensive, and do not require advanced technical skills.|$|R
30|$|For pre-cooking, whole <b>shrimp</b> (<b>head-on)</b> {{were placed}} in the {{stainless}} cooking pot filled with boiling water (100 °C) using a shrimp/water ratio of 1 : 3 (w/v). The samples were pre-cooked until the core temperature of the second segment of the shrimp reached 80 °C. The come-up time was approximately 3 min. Pre-cooked samples were suddenly transferred into the temperature-controlled water bath (Memmert, Schwabach, Germany) at 80 °C and were held for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 s. To measure the core temperature, the thermocouple (Union, Kowloon, Hong Kong) was inserted {{into the middle of the}} second segment of abdomen. After heating for a designated time, the samples were cooled rapidly in iced water for 1 min, and then the shrimp samples were drained for 5 min at 4 °C. The samples referred to as ‘pre-cooked shrimp’ were subjected to analyses and subsequent storage.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} paddle wheel {{aeration}} on shrimp {{growth and survival}} were studied at a commercial farm at Chandipur coast of Orissa, India, at different stocking densities of Penaeus monodon. Four different aeration patterns were adopted and evaluated. Influence of individual aeration pattern on average survival rate was not highly significant (p< 0. 05) at different stocking densities, while different aeration patterns had significant influence (p<O.

It was also estimated that 1. 77 hp (aerator) is needed for every 1000 <b>kg</b> <b>shrimp</b> biomass which corresponds to 1 hp/ 565 <b>kg</b> biomass of <b>shrimp.</b> Higher growth rate was mostly observed during 63 - 98 days of culture, when six 2 hp aerators were in use.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} assess the final body weight, weekly weight gain, yield, {{apparent}} feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, and feed intake of the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) fed four diets containing different levels of soy protein concentrate (SPC) {{as a replacement for}} fishmeal, reared in a super-intensive biofloc system. Diets consisted of replacing 209 g kg- 1 fishmeal at 0, 33, 66, and 100 % SPC. Shrimp were raised in a biofloc system using twelve experimental units stocked with 250 shrimp m- 3 under constant aeration (O 2 > 5 mg L- 1) and temperature (29 ± 0. 5 °C). No significant differences among treatments were observed based on water quality parameters. Shrimp fed diets with 0 and 33 % substitution exhibited the highest weekly growth (1. 88 and 1. 79 g per week) and final weights (15. 2 and 14. 7 g) compared with shrimp fed the 66 and 100 % replacement. A lower feed intake was observed for shrimp fed the 33 % SPC diet (3. 18 kg per experimental unit) compared with 0 % replacement (3. 62 <b>kg).</b> <b>Shrimp</b> fed the 33 % replacement achieved a similar performance and lower feed intake than animals fed diet without replacement...|$|R

A total of 10 nets were constructed with the same dimension and inner-outer mesh sizes (40 -mm and 80 -mm). Trials covered 160 -net hauls/type with 1 -hour submersion time. The shrimps were composed of Penaeus monodon, Penaeus merguensis, Metapenalis monoserus, Penaeus semiculatus and Parapenaeopsis sculptilis. A total of 142. 8 <b>kg</b> <b>shrimp</b> comprises 84. 46 kg (59. 15 %) for double-twisted and 58. 34 kg (40. 85 %) for triple-twisted were collected over 16 -daytrip sampling period, indicating double-twisted multifilament trammel net was 45 % more efficient. The average weight of double-twisted (5. 25 ± 1. 64 kg) was considerably {{higher than that of}} triple-twisted (3. 65 ± 1. 41 kg) as well as total YPUE of double-twisted (1. 056 ± 0. 02 kg) was considerably higher than that of triple-twisted (0. 729 ± 0. 02 kg) (P< 0. 05).

40|$|A deep-water {{trapping}} {{survey in}} the Palauan archipelago, Western Caroline Islands, has revealed {{an abundance of}} the Japanese red crab, Chaceon granulatus. The recorded depth range (250 - 900 m) {{is similar to that}} of other geryonids, but the large numbers of females caught below 700 m is atypical. Mean yields in excess of 5 kg crabs plus 1 <b>kg</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Heterocarpus laevigatus, by-catch per trap-night were attainable at optimum depths. Chaceon granulatus is apparently a very large geryonid, with maximum weights of 2. 02 kg and 1. 51 kg recorded for male and female specimens, respectively. A range of body colors was observed: Orange-red shades appear to dominate the deeper waters (below 500 m) while yellow-tan colors are more abundant in the upper reaches. Preliminary evidence suggests that Chaceon granulatus is highly marketable, and the infrastructure in Palau is such that crabs could either be marketed fresh locally or airfreighted to Japan as a quick-frozen product. The high post-trapping survival rates observed indicate that maintaining crabs in live-holding tanks may be a feasible option. The large catches and quality of deep-water crabs taken suggests that the Palauan population of Chaceon granulatus may be able to support a small-scale fishery. It is not yet known whether this population is unusually large or whether these findings typify the deep forereef fauna of the region...|$|R
40|$|The shrimp Caridina nilotica {{is a major}} prey of the {{introduced}} Nile perch in Lake Victoria. In {{spite of}} heavy predation, the density of shrimps increased after the Nile perch boom and the concomitant disappearance of the haplochromine cichlids. In the same period, the mean size of gravid shrimps and the size at first maturity declined. This seems to indicate an increased predation pressure on adult shrimps. Before the Nile perch upsurge, specialised shrimp eaters and piscivores, among the haplochromine cichlids, only took adult shrimps, whereas we assume that most haplochromines used to include juvenile shrimps into their diet. Another important predator on adult shrimps was Bagrus docmak. The combined density of predators on adult shrimps in the pre-Nile perch era was estimated at 10 kg ha) 1 and the potential predators on juveniles were estimated at 170 kg ha) 1. After the Nile perch upsurge, only Nile perch up to 10 cm TL and Rastrineobola argentea fed on juvenile <b>shrimps</b> (ca. 36 <b>kg</b> ha) 1) and Nile perch from 10 to 50 cm TL (ca. 13 kg ha) 1) fed on adults. These rough estimates of the biomass of predators on shrimps {{before and after the}} Nile perch upsurge indicate a reduced predation pressure on juvenile shrimps. The disappearance of the haplochromines may have released competition with small Nile perch for juvenile shrimps, thus enhancing the recruitment of Nile perch...|$|R
40|$|Two {{case studies}} from Southeast Asia {{are used to}} analyse production, {{environmental}} effects, and economic optimisation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) pond culture. A projection of these data is made {{for the whole of}} Thailand. The results are analysed on a regional scale based on site selection using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE).   Farm-scale culture was simulated for (i) tilapia monoculture in Chiang Rai; (ii) shrimp monoculture in Chanthaburi; and (iii) Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) of tilapia and shrimp in Chon Buri. Together, these provinces produced 17, 500 tonnes of tilapia in 2012, with a significant proportion exported to North America and Europe.   Growth models for both species were developed, calibrated, and validated, and used to simulate population dynamics of cultivated animals, and sediment diagenesis and eutrophication in ponds. Co-cultivation stimulates nitrogen dissolution (134 kg N cycle− 1), which is greater than in tilapia (96 <b>kg</b> N) or <b>shrimp</b> (52 <b>kg</b> N) monoculture, and doubles the NH 4 + discharge to the environment (10. 7 kg in tilapia monoculture, 20. 5 kg in co-cultivation). However, eutrophication as a result of shrimp monoculture decreases sharply chlorophyll emissions fall from 0. 17 kg to 0. 02 kg. A modelled IMTA scenario including the green seaweed Ulva reduced NH 4 + outflow to 0. 32 kg cycle− 1.   Scaling to the national level, for a 2010 production of 158, 293 t y− 1  (tilapia), and 553, 899 t y− 1  (shrimp), gives calculated emissions of 2, 105, 118 and 34, 904 Population Equivalents (PEQ) respectively. Only part is a negative externality, because rural agro-aqua systems in Thailand reuse discharges in holding ponds, rice culture, etc.   Commercial tilapia and shrimp aquaculture have a value added share of total GDP of 0. 38, and value added of 96. 24, resulting in indirect impacts of the industry on the Thai economy of $ 35 million, and the creation of 16, 000 additional jobs.   The MCE scenario analysis suggests sustainable expansion is possible for both species. The highly suitable class for tilapia would triple in the dry season, but halve in the rainy season. For shrimp the corresponding areas would decrease in both seasons. However, the suitable class is two orders of magnitude greater than the current level of tilapia farming, and shrimp could increase tenfold (limited by the rainy season due to low salinity). These projections which are constrained by competing land claims, will be further influenced by socio-economic factors, and would depend upon national or regional policy decisions.   These models, together with economic indicators developed for the aquaculture industry in Thailand, provide an overview of this important contributor to world aquaculture, which has a volume production greater than both the US and EU, and explore some of the lessons that may be learnt worldwide at both the local and national scales...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experiments conducted in saline aquaculture ponds demonstrated that organic matter was the primary factor influencing sediment sulfate reduction rates. Changes in sediment oxygen demand (SOD), sulfate reduction rates, and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) abundances were monitored in nine 0. 04 - 0. 08 ha earthen shrimp ponds during a 17 -week growing season. Organic matter (feed) was added at low, medium, and high rates in a block design. The aquaculture site was located in an and inland region near Imperial, Texas, and utilized saline groundwaters of lower salinity and proportionally higher sulfate concentrations than undiluted seawater. SOD was measured in situ with an enclosed chamber; sulfate reduction rates were measured in cores using injected []SO 4 - 2, and SRB counts were estimated using most probable number analyses. Shrimp growth rates averaged 1. 2 g shrimp- 1 week- 1, with a mean harvest weight of 20. 8 g shrimp- 1 (C. V. = 4. 5 %). Shrimp survival in the ponds was low, however, ranging from 10. 2 - 16. 5 % (mean = 12. 4 %). Shrimp yield averaged 473 <b>kg</b> <b>shrimp</b> ha- 1 (C. V. = 34 %), and was much lower than that for coastal shrimp ponds. No significant treatment difference ([] = 0. 05) in shrimp growth or survival could be found. Furthermore, no significant correlation could be demonstrated between shrimp survival and rates of sulfate reduction. Over the growing season SOD increased four-fold, SRB populations increased two orders of magnitude, and sulfate reduction rates increased over two orders of magnitude, with highest values occurring {{at the end of the}} season. Sulfide flux measurements demonstrated that sulfate reduction represented a greater proportion of SOD at the end of the season (mean: 84 %) than in the beginning (< 2 %). Sediment porewater sulfate concentrations were high at all depths (24. 7 - 3 1. 0 MM) and did not appear to limit sulfate reduction. Sediment depth profiles showed close parallels between organic matter content and sulfate reduction rates (r. 2 = 0. 66). Furthermore, significant differences (p < 0. 05) in sulfate reduction were found between ponds that had been used for aquaculture in the previous season versus newly constructed ponds. Differences were consistent with the hypothesis that sulfate reduction was regulated by organic matter quantity and reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Size {{distribution}} within re- ported landings is {{an important}} aspect of northern Gulf of Mexico penaeid shrimp stock assessments. It reflects shrimp population characteristics such as numerical abundance of various sizes, age structure, and vital rates (e. g. recruitment, growth, and mortality), as well as effects of fishing, fishing power, fishing practices, sampling, size-grading, etc. The usual measure of shrimp size in archived landings data is count (C) the number of shrimp tails (abdomen or edible portion) per pound (0. 4536 <b>kg).</b> <b>Shrimp</b> are marketed and landings reported in pounds within tail count categories. Statistically, these count categories are count class intervals or bins with upper and lower limits expressed in C. Count categories vary in width, overlap, and frequency of occurrence within the landings. The upper and lower limits of most count class intervals can be transformed to lower and upper limits (respectively) of class intervals expressed in pounds per shrimp tail, w, the reciprocal of C (i. e. w = 1 /C). Age based stock assessments have relied on various algorithms to estimate numbers of shrimp from pounds landed within count categories. These algorithms required un- derlying explicit or implicit assumptions about the distribution of C or w. However, no attempts were made to assess the actual distribution of C or w. Therefore, validity of the algorithms and assumptions could not be determined. When different algorithms were applied to landings within the same size categories, they produced different estimates of numbers of shrimp. This paper demonstrates a method of simulating the distribution of w in reported biological year landings of shrimp. We used, as examples, landings of brown shrimp, Farfantepenaeus aztecus, from the northern Gulf of Mexico fishery in biological years 1986 – 2006. Brown shrimp biological year, Ti, is defined as beginning on 1 May of the same calendar year as Ti and ending on 30 April of the next calendar year, where subscript i is the place marker for biological year. Biological year landings encompass most if not all of the brown shrimp life cycle and life span. Simulated distributions of w reflect all factors influencing sizes of brown shrimp in the landings within a given biological year. Our method does not require a priori assumptions about the parent distributions of w or C, and it takes into account the variability in width, overlap, and frequency of occurrence of count categories within the landings. Simulated biological year distributions of w can be transformed to equivalent distributions of C. Our method may be useful in future testing of previously applied algorithms and development of new estimators based on statistical estimation theory and the underlying distribution of w or C. We also examine some applications of biological year distributions of w, and additional variables derived from them...|$|R
