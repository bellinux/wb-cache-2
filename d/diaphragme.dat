6000|$|The Instrument {{consisted}} of five Rulers, or long pieces placed [...] together, after the manner exprest {{in the second}} Figure of the first [...] Scheme, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and [...] two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick, [...] {{on the back side}} of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht [...] from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so [...] very firmly fixt; {{in the middle of this}} was made a hole or center, into [...] which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass Box CC, fashion'd as I [...] shall by and by describe, was plac'd, and could very easily and truly [...] be mov'd to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and [...] moving in, a hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the [...] long Ruler EF, about three foot and three or four inches long, and at [...] three foot from the above mention'd Centers PP was a hole E, cut [...] through, and cross'd with two small threads, and at the end of it was [...] fixt a small sight G, and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm [...] H, with a Screw to fix it in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM [...] was mov'd on the Center B (which was exactly three foot distance from [...] the middle Center P) and a line drawn through the middle of it LM, was [...] divided by a Line of cords into some sixty degrees, and each degree was [...] subdivided into minutes, so that putting the cross of the threads in E [...] upon any part of this divided line, I presently knew what Angle the two [...] Rules AB and EF made with each other, and by turning the Screw in H, I [...] could fix them in any position. The other Ruler also RS was made much [...] after the same manner, only it was not fixt to the hollow cylindrical [...] Box, but, by means of two small brass Armes or Ears, it mov'd on the [...] Centers of it; this also, by means of the cross threads in the hole S, [...] and by a Screw in K, could be fastned on any division of another line [...] of cords of the same radius drawn on NO. And so by that means, the [...] Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also known. The Brass box [...] CC in the middle was shap'd very much like the Figure X, that is, it [...] was a cylindrical Box stopp'd close at either end, off of which a part [...] both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that the Box, when the [...] Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water when fill'd [...] half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure to be [...] inclin'd to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of [...] Water, and no more, without running over. The Ruler EF was fixt very [...] fast to the Pipe V, so that the Pipe V directed the length of the Ruler [...] EF, and the Box and Ruler were mov'd on the Pin TT, so as to make any [...] desirable Angle with the Ruler AB. The bottom of this Pipe V was stop'd [...] with a small piece of exactly plain Glass, which was plac'd exactly [...] perpendicular to the Line of direction, or Axis of the Ruler EF. The [...] Pins also TT were drill'd with small holes through the Axis, and [...] through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small Wire. There was [...] likewise a small Pipe of Tin loosly put on upon the end of V, and [...] reaching down to the sight G; the use of which was only to keep any [...] false Rayes of light from passing through the bottom of V, and only [...] admitting such to pass as pierced through the sight G: All things being [...] placed together in the manner describ'd in the Figure; that is, the [...] Ruler AB being fixt perpendicular, I fill'd the Box CC with Water, or [...] any other Liquor, whose refraction I intended to try, till the Wire [...] passing through the middle of it were just covered: then I moved and [...] fixt the Ruler FE at any assignable Angle, and placed the flame of a [...] Candle just against the sight G; and looking through the sight I, I [...] moved the Ruler RS to and fro, till I perceived the light passing [...] through G to be covered, as 'twere, or divided by the dark Wire passing [...] through PP: then turning the Screw in K, I fixt it in that posture: And [...] through the hole S, I observed what degree and part of it was cut by [...] the cross threads in S. And this gave me the Angle of Inclination, APS [...] answering to the Angle of Refraction BPE: for the surface of the Liquor [...] in the Box will be alwayes horizontal, and consequently AB will be a [...] perpendicular to it; the Angle therefore APS will measure, or be the [...] Angle of Inclination in the Liquor; next EPB must be the Angle of [...] Refraction, for the Ray that passes through the sight G, passes also [...] perpendicularly through the Glass <b>Diaphragme</b> at F, and consequently [...] also perpendicularly through the lower surface of the Liquor contiguous [...] to the Glass, and therefore suffers no refraction till it meet with the [...] horizontal surface of the Liquor in CC, which is determined by the two [...] Angles.|$|E
60|$|From all which, {{and several}} other {{particulars}} which I observ'd, I cannot but think, that all these, and most other kinds of stony bodies which are found thus strangely figured, do owe their formation and figuration, not {{to any kind of}} Plastick virtue inherent in the earth, but to the Shells of certain Shel-fishes, which, either by some Deluge, Inundation, Earthquake, or some such other means, came to be thrown to that place, and there to be fill'd with some kind of Mudd or Clay, or petrifying Water, or some other substance, which in tract of time has been settled together and hardned in those shelly moulds into those shaped substances we now find them; that the great and thin end of these Shells by that Earthquake, or what ever other extraordinary cause it was that brought them thither, was broken off; and that many others were otherwise broken, bruised and disfigured; that these Shells which are thus spirallied and separated with <b>Diaphragmes,</b> were some kind of Nautili or Porcelane shells; and that others were shells of Cockles, Muscles, Periwincles, Scolops, &c. of various sorts; that these Shells in many, from the particular nature of the containing or enclos'd Earth, or some other cause, have in tract of time rotted and mouldred away, and onely left their impressions, both on the containing and contained substances; and so left them pretty loose one within another, so that they may be easily separated by a knock or two of a Hammer. That others of these Shells, according {{to the nature of the}} substances adjacent to them, have, by a long continuance in that posture, been petrify'd and turn'd into the nature of stone, just as I even now observ'd several sorts of Wood to be. That oftentimes the Shell may be found with one kind of substance within, and quite another without; having, perhaps, been fill'd in one place, and afterwards translated to another, which I have very frequently observ'd in Cockle, Muscle, Periwincle, and other shells, which I have found by the Sea side. Nay, further, that some parts of the same Shell may be fill'd in one place, and some other caverns in another, and others in a third, or a fourth, or a fifth place, for so many differing substances have I found in one of these petrify'd Shells, and perhaps all these differing from the encompassing earth or stone; the means how all which varieties may be caus'd, I think, will not be difficult to conceive, to any one that has taken notice of those Shells, which are commonly found on the Sea shore: And he that shall throughly examine several kinds of such curiously form'd stones, will (I am very apt to think) find reason to suppose their generation or formation to be ascribable to some such accidents as I have mention'd, and not to any Plastick virtue: For it seems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence of Nature, which is observable in all its works and productions, to design every thing to a determinate end, and for the attaining of that end, makes use of such ways as are (as farr as the knowledge of man has yet been able to reach) altogether consonant, and most agreeable to man's reason, and of no way or means that does contradict, or is contrary to humane Ratiocination; whence it has a long time been a general observation and maxime, that Nature does nothing in vain; It seems, I say, contrary to that great Wisdom of Nature, that these prettily shap'd bodies should have all those curious Figures and contrivances (which many of them are adorn'd and contriv'd with) generated or wrought by a Plastick virtue, for no higher end, then onely to exhibite such a form; which he that shall throughly consider all the circumstances of such kind of Figur'd bodies, will, I think, have great reason to believe, though, I confess, one cannot presently be able to find out what Nature's designs are. It were therefore very desirable, that a good collection of such kind of figur'd stones were collected; and as many particulars, circumstances, and informations collected with them as could be obtained, that from such a History of Observations well rang'd, examin'd and digested, the true original or production of all those kinds of stones might be perfectly and surely known; such as are Thunder-stones, Lapides Stellares, Lapides Judaici, and multitudes of other, whereof mention is made in Aldonandus, Wormius, and other Writers of Minerals.|$|R
