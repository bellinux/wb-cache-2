The effects of exposure, age of the processing solution, and line frequently on the image quality of the Kodak PMT system were studied. Exposure was varied by exposing the material to a standard illuminance for different amounts of time; the processing solution was aged by bubbling air through it for varied amounts of time; line frequency was varied by using a Kodak sinusoidal target and examining the images of two different frequencies. Data was obtained from microdensitometer traces of the images produced and statistically analyzed to determine the significance of the factors involved. It was found that line frequency was the most signficant factor, followed by exposure and finally by the age of the processing solution. The interaction of line frequency and age of the processing solution was also found to be statistically significant...|$|E

According to a model of predominant electrostatic interactions, zwitterionic and anionic lipid vesicles were used to optimize the peptide association with the lipid membranes. Both planar silica and core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were used as polar hydrophilic substrates to form the SLBs functionalized with the NGF peptide. The hybrid biointerface was scrutinized by a multitechnique approach with QCM-D, FRAP and fluorescence spectroscopy in terms of self-assembling kinetics, lipid lateral <b>diffusion,</b> and energy <b>transfer</b> <b>processes</b> in the SLB-wrapped silica NPs dye-doped in the core.

40|$|Coherent {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) spectroscopy at 80 K {{was used}} to study chlorosomes isolated from green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. Two distinct processes {{in the evolution of}} the 2 D spectrum are observed. The first being exciton diffusion, seen in the change of the spectral shape occurring on a 100 -fs timescale, and the second being vibrational coherences, realized through coherent beatings with frequencies of 91 and 145 cm(- 1) that are dephased during the first 1. 2 ps. The distribution of the oscillation amplitude in the 2 D spectra is independent of the evolution of the 2 D spectral shape. This implies that the <b>diffusion</b> energy <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> does not <b>transfer</b> coherences within the chlorosome. Remarkably, the oscillatory pattern observed in the negative regions of the 2 D spectrum (dominated by the excited state absorption) is a mirror image of the oscillations found in the positive part (originating from the stimulated emission and ground state bleach). This observation is surprising since it is expected that coherences in the electronic ground and excited states are generated with the same probability and the latter dephase faster in the presence of fast diffusion. Moreover, the relative amplitude of coherent beatings is rather high compared to non-oscillatory signal despite the reported low values of the Huang-Rhys factors. The origin of these effects is discussed in terms of the vibronic and Herzberg-Teller couplings...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of calcite in and near faults, {{as the dominant}} material, cement, or vein fill, indicates that the mechanical behaviour of carbonate-dominated material likely {{plays an important role}} in shallow- and mid-crustal faulting. To better understand the behaviour of calcite, under loading conditions relevant to earthquake nucleation, we sheared powdered gouge of Carrara Marble, > 98 per cent CaCO 3, at constant normal stresses between 1 and 100 MPa under water-saturated conditions at room temperature. We performed slide-hold-slide tests, 1 – 3000 s, to measure the amount of static frictional strengthening and creep relaxation, and velocity-stepping tests, 0. 1 – 1000 μm s– 1, to evaluate frictional stability. We observe that the rates of frictional strengthening and creep relaxation decrease with increasing normal stress and diverge as shear velocity is increased from 1 to 3000 μm s– 1 during slide-hold-slide experiments. We also observe complex frictional stability behaviour that depends on both normal stress and shearing velocity. At normal stresses less than 20 MPa, we observe predominantly velocity-neutral friction behaviour. Above 20 MPa, we observe strong velocity-strengthening frictional behaviour at low velocities, which then evolves towards velocity-weakening friction behaviour at high velocities. Microstructural analyses of recovered samples highlight a variety of deformation mechanisms including grain size reduction and localization, folding of calcite grains and fluid-assisted <b>diffusion</b> mass <b>transfer</b> <b>processes</b> promoting the development of calcite nanograins in the highly deformed portions of the experimental fault. Our combined analyses indicate that calcite fault gouge transitions from brittle to semi-brittle behaviour at high normal stress and slow sliding velocities.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to study the mechanism and kinetics of hydrated electron diffusion. The electron center of mass is found to exhibit Brownian-type behavior with a diffusion coefficient considerably {{greater than that of}} the solvent. As previously postulated by both experimental and theoretical works, the instantaneous response of the electron to the librational motions of surrounding water molecules constitutes the principal mode of motion. The diffusive mechanism can be understood within the traditional framework of <b>transfer</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>processes,</b> where the diffusive step is akin to the exchange of an extramolecular electron between neighboring water molecules. This is a second-order process with a computed rate constant of 5. 0 ps^{- 1 } at 298 K. In agreement with experiment the electron diffusion exhibits Arrhenius behavior over the temperature range of 298 - 400 K. We compute an activation energy of 8. 9 kJ/mol. Through analysis of Arrhenius plots and the application of a simple random walk model it is demonstrated that the computed rate constant for exchange of an excess electron is indeed the phenomenological rate constant associated with the diffusive process...|$|R
40|$|This review {{presents}} {{results of}} the recent calculations of collective plasma processes of radiation transport in the solar interior. The review introduces a remarkable number of previously neglected effects which are shown to reduce substantially the Rosseland opacity at {{the centre of the}} Sun (the decrease of opacity is approximately 10 %, which is greater than the previously accepted possible errors in opacity). It is also shown that effects which were previously treated without taking into account the collective behaviour of plasma, change appreciably when the collective nature of the plasma is included. The analysis is based on modern concepts of plasma physics in which an essential role is played by photon scattering on ions and by the oscillations of ion electron shells in emission and bremsstrahlung absorption processes. The processes which contribute most to a decrease in opacity are: the broadening of the Raman resonance (due to both the Doppler effect and binary electron-ion collisions), frequency <b>diffusion</b> in radiation <b>transfer</b> <b>processes,</b> the processes of stimulated scattering and collective quantum corrections to the scattering.
