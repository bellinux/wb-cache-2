40|$|In {{the period}} 1965 - 1985 numbers of {{migrating}} geese wintering in The Netherlands increased notably: from approximately 100. 000 to 600. 000 birds. Not all these birds are present {{during the whole}} winterseason: a maximum of about {{seventy percent of the}} total number of geese occurring in The Netherlands is present at the same time during the month of January. Along with this spread in time, geese are distributed geograffically, mainly over the lower parts of the country. In this respect the province of Friesland plays a significant part since almost sixty percent of all wintering geese stay in this northern province for a longer period. Since some goose species (Branta leucopsis, Br. bernicla and Anser brachyrhynchus) have a close season, and others (Anser anser, A. fabalis and A. albifrons) can be shot only during a certain period (from September 1 st till January 31 th) and time of day (half an hour before sunrise till 10. 00 a. m.), any damage caused by goose-grazing is completely compensated for by the Dutch government, more specifically the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. A side-reflection is the recognition that all scaring techniques are effective only for a fairly short period and require not only persistence but also the presence of an area where the geese can be scared to, either a refuge or a place where they will be tolerated. This is not yet the case. Along with the increase in geesenumbers a steady rise in the number of complaints by dairy farmers became manifest every year. Per province an annual review of all complaints concerning goose-damage is presented as well as the crops concerned. Over ninety percent of these complaints concern goose-grazing on pasture land, in more than ninety seven percent restricted to the province of Friesland, the main problem being yield losses at first cut. Yearly amounts paid by the Game Fund to compensate for these losses increased from sixthousand Dfl. in 1974 to one and a half million Dfl. in 1984; every year more than half a the total amount is paid to Frisian farmers. The intensification of dairy farming in The Netherlands is discussed, the main topics being changes in grassland utilisation, the application of growing quantities of mineral fertilizers, the increase in yearly reseed and the use of new mixtures. In combination with an improved drainage this resulted in a shortening of the nonproductive winter-period. An increasing number of wintering geese benefit from the fact that more grass of a better quality is available in autumn and spring. From an inventory of methods used by the provincial Game Damage Committees to assess goose-damage, their appears to be very little conformity, mainly caused by the fact that the subject was never thoroughly studied. In order to find a uniform, standardized method for the assessment of yield losses due to goose-grazing, a four year research program was carried out by the Centre for Agrobiological Research (CABO, Wageningen). In the study area, the northern Dutch province of Friesland, the effect of goose- grazing was studied on growth and production of Lolium swards in a temperate climate. Experiments were conducted over three winter periods (1982 - 1985) of which the first two may be classified as "mild" winters, the last one was "hard" and characterized by very low grazing intensity. The difference in sward height between the grazed (g) and ungrazed (u) plots at the time of last goose-grazing (V) turns out to be an essential parameter in explaining losses in herbage production at the time of the first cut; it also provides a method for calculating growth retardation (in days) due to goose-grazing. Goose-grazing generally causes loss of herbage yield in the first cut (early bite); this effect does not occur in subsequent cuts. The extent of this loss (in kg dm) is correlated with:- the difference in sward height (grazed - ungrazed) at time V;- the undisturbed yield level at the time of harvest;- the temperature sum (T-sum) at the time of harvest. Moreover after a mild winter the T-sum at the time of the last heavy goose-grazing plays a significant role; in a hard winter this is the case with the T-sum at V. Retardation can also be calculated from the absolute yield loss (in kg dm) and net daily production of the corresponding sward (in kg dm day - 1 ). Generally speaking yield losses are bigger after a mild than after a hard winter (and so is retardation). Goose-grazing causes a reduction of the LAI-values of the grass; this results in a decline in daily dry-matter production (kg dm 100 m - 2 day - 1 ) as a result of which yield losses occur in the first cut. These losses are always bigger than the calculated herbage consumption by geese in the preceding period, both expressed in kg dm 100 m - 2 . Comparison of goose-dropping contents with the botanical composition of the grazed sward show that there is no significant food selection, the former being a true reflection of the latter. Goose-grazing may cause an improvement in <b>early</b> <b>bite</b> quality (in terms of kVEM kg dm - 1 ) but the kVEM-loss per hectare is so big that the former advantage pales into insignificance in relation to the latter loss of quantity (one feed unit VEM = 1. 65 kcal = 1. 65 * 4. 1868 J). One and even two winters of goose-grazing did not noticeably affect the total number of plant species in the sward, nor dry weight percentages or number of tillers dm - 2 per species. We could not demonstrate any permanent effect of the combination of goose-grazing, treading and manure on the P, K and N content of the upper soil layer; we did not find any effect on permeability, carrying capacity (solidity) and moisture level of that same layer. The agricultural importance of goose-droppings should be considered as insignificant: in terms of nitrogen supply for example this will be less than ten percent of the farmers N-gift for the first cut. Moreover such plant nutrients as the geese provide have come directly from the soil on which the birds feed and are not additions. A guideline is presented to the assessment of goose damage to herbage production using the difference in T-sum values at the time the sward is grazed for the last time (V) and at the time of harvest. A grassland utilization scheme is discussed, in particular for use and management of the first cut. Small adaptations in such a scheme might help in lessening the conflict between dairy farming and goose-grazing in The Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{progress}} in malaria control, malaria remains an important public health concern in Cambodia, mostly linked to forested areas. Large-scale vector control interventions in Cambodia {{are based on}} the free distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), targeting indoor- and late-biting malaria vectors only. The present study evaluated the vector density, <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> activity and malaria transmission of outdoor-biting malaria vectors in two forested regions in Cambodia. Methods: In 2005 two entomological surveys were conducted in 12 villages and their related forest plots in the east and west of Cambodia. Mosquitoes were collected outdoors by human landing collections and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium sporozoites after morphological identification. Blood samples were collected in the same villages for serological analyses. Collected data were analysed by the classification and regression tree (CART) method and linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 11, 826 anophelines were recorded landing in 787 man-night collections. The majority (82. 9 %) were the known primary and secondary vectors. Most of the variability in vector densities and <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> rates was explained by geographical factors, mainly at village level. Vector densities were similar between forest and village sites. Based on ELISA results, 29 % out of 17 Plasmodium-positive bites occurred before sleeping time, and 65 % in the forest plots. The entomological inoculation rates of survey 1 were important predictors of the respective seroconversion rates in survey 2, whereas the mosquito densities were not. Discussion: In Cambodia, outdoor malaria transmission in villages and forest plots is important. In this context, deforestation might result in lower densities of the primary vectors, but also in higher densities of secondary vectors invading deforested areas. Moreover, higher accessibility of the forest could result in a higher manvector contact. Therefore, additional vector control measures should be developed to target outdoor- and earlybiting vectors...|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to eat a}} food again in the future appears {{to be driven by}} several psychological factors generally related to memory of the previous consumption episode. People have a better memory for their enjoyment of a food at the end than {{at the beginning of a}} past consumption episode - they better remember the last bite than the first. As a consequence, their enjoyment of the last bite of a food (which is usually less enjoyable than the first) is the best predictor of how soon again they wish to eat that food in the future. This greater weighting of the last bite than the first bite is due to an interference in memory, whereby memories for later bites make it harder to remember enjoyment of <b>earlier</b> <b>bites</b> of the food.|$|R
40|$|In Tanzania {{there has}} been a {{downward}} trend in malaria prevalence partly due to use of insecticide-treated bed nets for protection against Anopheles mosquitoes. However, residual malaria transmission attributed to <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> behaviour of malaria vectors is being reported. Knowledge of mosquito feeding behaviour is key to improvements in control approaches. The present study aimed to assess knowledge and awareness on malaria and malaria vectors in-Morogoro and Dodoma regions of Tanzania. A cross sectional study was undertaken in selected sites in Morogoro and Dodoma Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was administered to 218 randomly selected households from each of which the head or second in/charge and the most senior primary school child were interviewed. A total of 400 participants of whom 56  % were females, were recruited into the study. Their ages ranged between nine and 58  years. Among the participants, 70. 7  % had primary school education and the rest attained secondary school (16. 8  %), university/college (4. 0  %) and not attended school at all (8. 5  %). Fifteen per cent of the participants were employed, while 45. 5  % were self-employed and 39. 5  % were studying. Overall, 58. 5  % of respondents were knowledgeable of malaria and its vector. However, 78. 8  % were not aware that <b>early</b> mosquito <b>bites</b> can transmit malaria and 86. 5  % said that only midnight-biting mosquito bite was responsible for malaria transmission. The majority (66  %) of respondents visited a health facility on observing malaria symptoms while 15. 8  % took anti-malaria drugs without medical consultation. This study has shown that Anopheles is well known as the night-biting vector of malaria. The majority of participants were not aware of changed biting behaviour of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes and that <b>early</b> outdoor mosquito <b>bite</b> is a risk of malaria transmission.

Although long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are now the primary malaria vector control intervention in the Solomon Islands, only {{a small proportion of}} An. farauti still seek blood meals indoors and late at night where they are vulnerable to being killed by contract with the insecticides in LLINs. The effectiveness of LLINs and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling malaria transmission where the vectors are exophagic and <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> will depend on whether the predominant outdoor or <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> phenotypes are associated with a subpopulation of the vectors present. Methods: Mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted in the Solomon Islands to determine if individual An. farauti repeat the same behaviours over successive feeding cycles. The two behavioural phenotypes examined were those on which the WHO recommended malaria vector control strategies, LLINs and IRS, depend: indoor and late night biting. Results: Evidence was found for An. farauti being a single population regarding time (early evening or late night) and location (indoor or outdoor) of blood feeding. Individual An. farauti did not consistently repeat behavioural phenotypes expressed for blood feeding (e. g., while most mosquitoes that fed early and outdoors, and would repeat those behaviours, some fed late at night or indoors in the next feeding cycle). Conclusions: The finding that An. farauti is a homogeneous population is significant, because during the multiple feeding cycles required to complete the extrinsic incubation period, many individual female anophelines will enter houses late at night and be exposed to the insecticides used in LLINs or IRS. This explains, in part, the control that LLINs and IRS have exerted against a predominantly outdoor feeding vector, such as An. farauti. These findings may be relevant to many of the outdoor feeding vectors that dominate transmission in much of the malaria endemic world and justifies continued use of LLINs. However, the population-level tendency of mosquitoes to feed outdoors and early in the evening does require complementary interventions to accelerate malaria control towards elimination. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Southwestern Uganda {{has high}} malaria {{heterogeneity}} despite moderate vector control and other interventions. Moreover, the <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> transmission and increased resistance to insecticides might compromise strategies relying on vector control. Consequently, monitoring of vector behaviour and insecticide efficacy {{is needed to}} assess the effectiveness of strategies aiming at malaria control. This eventually led to an entomological survey in two villages with high malaria prevalence in this region. Methods: During rainy, 2011 and dry season 2012, mosquitoes were collected in Engari and Kigorogoro, Kazo subcounty, using human landing collection, morning indoor resting collection, pyrethrum spray collection and larval collection. Circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in female Anopheles mosquitoes was detected using ELISA assay. Bioassays to monitor Anopheles resistance to insecticides were performed. Results: Of the 1, 021 female Anopheles species captured, 62 % (632) were Anopheles funestus and 36 % (371) were Anopheles gambiae s. l. The most common species were Anopheles gambiae s. l. in Engari (75 %) and A. funestus in Kigorogoro (83 %). Overall, P. falciparum prevalence was 2. 9 % by ELISA. The daily entomological inoculation rates were estimated at 0. 17 and 0. 58 infected bites/person/night during rainy and dry season respectively in Engari, and 0. 81 infected bites/person/night in Kigorogoro during dry season. In both areas and seasons, an unusually <b>early</b> evening <b>biting</b> peak was observed between 6 - 8 p. m. In Engari, insecticide bioassays showed 85 %, 34 % and 12 % resistance to DDT during the rainy season, dry season and to deltamethrin during the dry season, respectively. In Kigorogoro, 13 % resistance to DDT and to deltamethrin was recorded. There was no resistance observed to bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of mosquito distribution, entomological indicators and resistance to insecticides in villages with high malaria prevalence highlight {{the need for a}} long-term vector control programme and monitoring of insecticide resistance in Uganda. The <b>early</b> evening <b>biting</b> habits of Anopheles combined with resistance to DDT and deltamethrin observed in this study suggest that use of impregnated bed nets alone is insufficient as a malaria control strategy, urging the need for additional interventions in this area of high transmission...|$|R

Further sampling {{of humans and}} mosquitoes in this area during 2009 – 2010 showed P. knowlesi infections in 32 (26 %) persons with malaria (n = 125) and in 31 (43 %) sporozoite-positive An. dirus mosquitoes (n = 73). Coinfections of P. knowlesi and P. vivax were predominant in mosquitoes and humans, while single P. knowlesi infections were found only in mosquitoes. P. knowlesi–co-infected patients were largely asymptomatic and were concentrated among ethnic minority families who commonly spend nights in the forest. P. knowlesi carriers were signifi cantly younger than those infected with other malaria parasite species. These results imply that even if human malaria could be eliminated, forests that harbor An. dirus mosquitoes and macaque monkeys will remain a reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of P. knowlesi.

40|$|Abstract Background In the Solomon Islands, the Malaria Eradication Programmes of the 1970 s {{virtually}} {{eliminated the}} malaria vectors: Anopheles punctulatus and Anopheles koliensis, both late night biting, endophagic species. However, the vector, Anopheles farauti, changed its behaviour to <b>bite</b> <b>early</b> {{in the evening}} outdoors. Thus, An. farauti mosquitoes were able to avoid insecticide exposure and still maintain transmission. Thirty years on and the Solomon Islands are planning for intensified malaria control and localized elimination; but little is currently known about the behaviour of the vectors and how they will respond to intensified control. Methods In the elimination area, Temotu Province, standard entomological collection methods were conducted in typical coastal villages to determine the vector, its ecology, biting density, behaviour, longevity, and vector efficacy. These vector surveys were conducted pre-intervention and post-intervention following indoor residual spraying and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets. Results Anopheles farauti was the only anopheline in Temotu Province. In 2008 (pre-intervention), this species occurred in moderate to high densities (19. 5 - 78. 5 bites/person/night) and expressed a tendency to <b>bite</b> outdoors, <b>early</b> in the night (peak biting time 6 - 8 pm). Surveys post intervention showed that there was little, if any, reduction in biting densities and no reduction in the longevity of the vector population. After adjusting for human behaviour, indoor biting was reduced from 57 % pre-intervention to 40 % post-intervention. Conclusion In an effort to learn from historical mistakes and develop successful elimination programmes, {{there is a need}} for implementing complimentary vector control tools that can target exophagic and <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> vectors. Intensified indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide net use has further promoted the early, outdoor feeding behaviour of An. farauti in the Solomon Islands. Consequently, the effectiveness of IRS and the personal protection provided by bed nets is compromised. To achieve elimination, any residual transmission should be targeted using integrated vector control incorporating complementary tools such as larviciding and/or zooprophylaxis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: In certain {{regions in}} Southeast Asia, where malaria {{is reduced to}} forested regions {{populated}} by ethnic minorities dependent on slash-and-burn agriculture, malaria vector populations have developed a propensity to feed early and outdoors, limiting the effectiveness of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The interplay between heterogeneous human, as well as mosquito behaviour, radically challenges malaria control in such residual transmission contexts. This study examines human behavioural patterns {{in relation to the}} vector behaviour. Methods: The anthropological research used a sequential mixed-methods study design in which quantitative survey research methods were used to complement findings from qualitative ethnographic research. The qualitative research existed of in-depth interviews and participant observation. For the entomological research, indoor and outdoor human landing collections were performed. All research was conducted in selected villages in Ratanakiri province, Cambodia. Results: Variability in human behaviour resulted in variable exposure to outdoor and <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> vectors: (i) indigenous people were found to commute between farms in the forest, where malaria exposure is higher, and village homes; (ii) the indoor/outdoor biting distinction was less clear in forest housing often completely or partly open to the outside; (iii) reported sleeping times varied according to the context of economic activities, impacting on the proportion of infections that could be accounted for by early or nighttime biting; (iv) protection by LLINs may not be as high as self-reported survey data indicate, as observations showed around 40 % (non-treated) market net use while (v) unprotected evening resting and deep forest activities impacted further on the suboptimal use of LLINs. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of human behaviour and the variation of vector densities and biting behaviours may lead to a considerable proportion of exposure occurring during times that people are assumed to be protected by the distributed LLINs. Additional efforts in improving LLIN use during times when people are resting in the evening and during the night might still have an impact on further reducing malaria transmission in Cambodia...|$|R

Of 85, 197 anophelines collected in 1, 276 paired indoor and outdoor landing catches, 40. 4 % were Anopheles koliensis Owen, 36. 7 % An. punctulatus Donitz, 14. 3 % Art. karwari (James), 4. 9 % An. farauti s. l. Laveran, 3. 1 % An. longirostris Brug, and 0. 7 % An. bancroftii Giles. Maps of average indoor biting rates were produced using a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model which allowed for heterogeneities in sampling effort over time and space. Differences in spatial distributions among species were observed among and within villages and {{were related to the}} distribution of larval habitats and vegetation. Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sago swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An. farauti s. l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor <b>biting</b> rates, and <b>earlier</b> <b>biting</b> times than An. punctulatus. Human blood indices of at least 0. 79 were observed for all species except An. bancroftii. Abundance of all 6 species was correlated temporally with recent rainfall, but An. koliensis, An. kanvari, and An. longirostris showed greater temporal variability than the other species.

We present a {{site-specific}} entomological study of malaria vectors and transmission indices {{as part of an}} effort to develop a site for the testing of improved control strategies including possible vaccine trials. Methods Pyrethrum spray catches (PSC), and indoor and outdoor human landing collections of adult female anopheline mosquitoes were carried out over a six-month period (November 2005 - April 2006) at Kpone-on-Sea, a fishing village in southern Ghana. These were morphologically identified to species level and sibling species of the Anopheles gambiae complex further characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum mosquito infectivity and host blood meal sources. Parity rate was examined based on dilatation of ovarian tracheoles following dissection. Results Of the 1233 Anopheles mosquitoes collected, An. gambiae s. l. was predominant (99. 5 %), followed by An. funestus (0. 4 %) and An. pharoensis (0. 1 %). All An. gambiae s. l. examined (480) were identified as An. gambiae s. s. with a majority of M molecular form (98. 2 %) and only 1. 8 %[*]S form with no record of M/S hybrid. A significantly higher proportion of anophelines were observed outdoors relative to indoors (χ 2 [*]=[*] 159. 34, df[*]=[*] 1, p[*] An. gambiae M molecular form contributed to transmission with a high degree of anthropophily, parity rate and an estimated entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 62. 1 infective bites/person/year. The Majority of the infective bites occurred outdoors after 09. 00 [*]pm reaching peaks between 12. 00 - 01. 00 [*]am and 03. 00 - 04. 00 [*]am. Conclusion Anopheles gambiae M molecular form is responsible for maintaining the status quo of malaria in the surveyed site during the study period. The findings provide a baseline for evidence-based planning and implementation of improved malaria interventions. The plasticity observed in biting patterns especially the combined outdoor and <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> behavior of the vector may undermine the success of insecticide-based strategies using insecticide treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spray (IRS). As such, novel or improved vector interventions should be informed by the local malaria epidemiology data as it relates to vector behavior. </p...|$|R
40|$|A malaria {{intervention}} comparative {{trial was}} carried out in Solomon Islands between 1987 and 1992, involving 7 pairs 14 communities, with 29, 182 people. Seven communities were given bed nets impregnated with permethrin annually at 0. 5 g/m', and the others sprayed biannually with DDT at dosage 2 g/m 3. Each pair was evaluated for about two years, by measuring entomological indices, prevalence of infection, incidence of infection, and levels of community compliance. An intensive differential cost analysis of both interventions was done in one pair of the communities and an analysis on cost and benefit of PCD mechanism was done in three pairs. Anopheles farauti, the main vector, (A. punctulatus, an inland vector became very rare with interventions), maintained the <b>early</b> evening <b>biting</b> peak and high outdoor biting. The highest transmission potential was indoor with high parity (54. 1 %) and sporozoite rate (1. 42 %). It avoided contact on DDT sprayed surface and was not killed even though it was still sensitive with a 75. 1 % mortality. Ther...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has found that one vial of antivenom is sufficient for the treatment of envenomation by all five major groups of Australian snakes. In snake bite coagulopathy, serial coagulation testing helps determine when patients can be safely discharged, but abnormal results are not an indication for further antivenom. Clinically significant rhabdomyolysis is more common than previously realised in red-bellied black snake envenomation. Early antivenom administration may prevent rhabdomyolysis, but it is unclear if this benefit outweighs the risk of adverse reactions to antivenom.

40|$|Bite {{is a type}} of wound {{received}} from the teeth of an animal, including humans. Human bites are third leading cause of all bites after dog and cat bites. Human bites are severe wounds due to the risk of contamination with mix oral flora and rapid tissue destruction. Bite wounds created by humans are seen in variety of circumstances including aggression, rape, murder, and child abuse. Oral cavity contains beta-hemolytic streptococci, anaerobes and other microorganisms. There have been reported cases of septicemia, severe necrotizing fasciitis, HIV infection, and death caused by human <b>bites.</b> <b>Early</b> reporting and treatment of bite wounds decrease the number and severity of wound infection.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of primary infections {{of the hand}} in injuries comprises essentially that of tetanus, gas gangrene, and the infection itself. The infections mentioned are panaris, phlegmon, the sequels of bites and gas gangrene. The treatment of panaris is immediate surgery. This consists of incision-excision without closure. That of the phlegmons is urgent. It depends {{on the stage of}} development of the infection and on the topography of the phlegmon. At stage 1 the authors advise filiform drainage. In stages II and III the treatment comprises saucerization and excision of the necrosed tissues, as well as cutaneous closure. The <b>early</b> treatment of <b>bites</b> may be medical if the portals of entry remain open. The only really efficacious treatment of gas gangrene is early surgical saucerization.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to cephalometrically analyze the stability of dentoalveolar and skeletal changes produced by a removable appliance with palatal crib associated to high-pull chincup in individuals with anterior open bite treated for 12 months, and compare them to individuals with similar malocclusion and age, not submitted to orthodontic treatment, also followed for the same period. METHODS: Nineteen children {{with a mean age}} of 9. 78 years old treated for 12 months with a removable appliance with palatal crib associated with chincup therapy were evaluated after 15 months (post-treatment period) and compared with a control group of 19 subjects with mean age of 9. 10 years with the same malocclusion that was followed-up for the same period. Seventy-six lateral cephalograms were evaluated at T 1 (after correction) and T 2 (follow-up) and cephalometric variables were analyzed by statistical tests. RESULTS: The results did not show significant skeletal, soft tissue or maxillary dentoalveolar changes. Overall, treatment effects on the experimental group were maintained at T 2 evaluation with an increase of 0. 56 mm in overbite. Overjet and maxillary incisors/molars position (vertical and sagittal) remained essentially unchanged during the study period. Only mandibular incisors showed significant changes (labial inclination and protrusion) compared to control group. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, it can be concluded that the <b>early</b> open <b>bite</b> treatment with a removable appliance and palatal crib associated with high-pull chincup therapy provided stability of 95 %...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{mosquito}} vectors bite and rest outdoors, which contributes to sustained residual malaria transmission in endemic areas. Spatial repellents {{are thought to}} create a protective “bubble” within which mosquito bites are reduced and may be ideal for outdoor use. This study builds on previous studies that proved efficacy of transfluthrin-treated hessian strips against outdoor biting mosquitoes. The goal {{of this study was}} to modify strips into practical, attractive and acceptable transfluthrin treated sisal and hessian emanators that confer protection against potential infectious bites before people use bed nets especially in the early evening and outdoors. This study was conducted in Kilombero Valley, Ulanga District, south-eastern Tanzania. Results: The protective efficacy of hand-crafted transfluthrin-treated sisal decorative baskets and hessian wall decorations against <b>early</b> evening outdoor <b>biting</b> malaria vectors was measured by human landing catches (HLC) in outdoor bars during peak outdoor mosquito biting activity (19 : 00 to 23 : 00 h).

40|$|Background Quantitative genetic {{analysis}} of basic mouse behaviors {{is a powerful}} tool to identify novel genetic phenotypes contributing to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we analyzed genetic contributions to single-trial, long-term social and nonsocial recognition and subsequently studied the functional impact of an identified candidate gene on behavioral development. Methods Genetic mapping of single-trial social recognition was performed in chromosome substitution strains, a sophisticated tool for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of complex traits. Follow-up occurred by generating and testing knockout (KO) mice of a selected QTL candidate gene. Functional characterization of these mice was performed through behavioral and neurological assessments across developmental stages and analyses of gene expression and brain morphology. Results Chromosome substitution strain 14 mapping studies revealed an overlapping QTL related to long-term social and object recognition harboring Pcdh 9, a cell-adhesion gene previously associated with autism spectrum disorder. Specific long-term social and object recognition deficits were confirmed in homozygous (KO) Pcdh 9 -deficient mice, while heterozygous mice only showed long-term social recognition impairment. The recognition deficits in KO mice were not associated with alterations in perception, multi-trial discrimination learning, sociability, behavioral flexibility, or fear memory. Rather, KO mice showed additional impairments in sensorimotor development reflected by <b>early</b> touch-evoked <b>biting,</b> rotarod performance, and sensory gating deficits. This profile emerged with structural changes in deep layers of sensory cortices, where Pcdh 9 is selectively expressed. Conclusions This behavior-to-gene study implicates Pcdh 9 in cognitive functions required for long-term social and nonsocial recognition. This role {{is supported by the}} involvement of Pcdh 9 in sensory cortex development and sensorimotor phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnopheles farauti is {{the primary}} malaria vector {{throughout}} the coastal regions of the Southwest Pacific. A shift in peak biting time from late to early in the night occurred following widespread indoor residue spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and has persisted in some island populations despite the intervention ending decades ago. We used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data and 12 newly developed microsatellite markers to assess the population genetic structure of this malaria vector in the Solomon Archipelago. With geographically distinct differences in peak A. farauti night biting time observed in the Solomon Archipelago, we tested the hypothesis that strong barriers to gene flow exist in this region. Significant and often large fixation index (FST) values were found between different island populations for the mitochondrial and nuclear markers, suggesting highly restricted gene flow between islands. Some discordance in the location and strength of genetic breaks was observed between the mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. Since <b>early</b> night <b>biting</b> A. farauti individuals occur naturally in all populations, the strong gene flow barriers that we have identified in the Solomon Archipelago lend weight to {{the hypothesis that the}} shifts in peak biting time from late to early night have appeared independently in these disconnected island populations. For this reason, we suggest that insecticide impregnated bed nets and indoor residue spraying are unlikely to be effective as control tools against A. farauti occurring elsewhere, and if used, will probably result in peak biting time behavioural shifts similar to that observed in the Solomon Islands...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} microdams on local microclimate and malaria transmission {{and in order to}} develop appropriate methods for the control of this disease, a longitudinal microclimatic, entomological, and clinical study was conducted. The study took place in two topographically similar villages: Deba, near a microdam and Maisheru, 3 - 4 km away, in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, where an extensive dam construction is in progress in epidemic prone areas. The weather was recorded in both villages, on the dam embankment and at different mosquito habitats. A community-led larval intervention study followed the impact assessment phase in the dam village. There was a 3. 1 times greater prevalence of an enlarged spleen and 2 - 5. 5 times higher incidence of falciparum malaria in children under 10 years of age in the dam village compared to the remote village, indicating a greater level of exposure experienced in the dam village. Anopheles arabiensis, which was highly anthropophilic, partially exophilic, and showed <b>early</b> <b>biting</b> peak (19 : 00 - 20 : 00 hr), was 6. 5 - 8 times more abundant in the dam village compared to the remote village and this was even higher during the dry season (xl 6) when a second peak in density was observed in the former. This corresponded to when the fields were irrigated indicating that transmission of malaria was no longer restricted to the rainy season in the dam village compared to the remote village. Despite DDT spraying and prompt treatment of clinical cases with Fansidar at a community level, the findings demonstrated that dams have the potential to increase transmission of malaria parasites. The dam not only created abundant mosquito breeding sites throughout the year, but also resulted in significant microclimate changes; notably elevated minimum atmospheric temperature, the influence weakening with distance from the dam. The dam site was 1. 5 ºC warmer than the dam village and that of the dam village was 1. 3 ºC higher than the remote village and was especially pronounced (> 3. 5 ºC) in the cool/dry season. Mean air temperature recorded under vegetation was 1. 7 ºC lower than outside and the dam provided numerous cool and humid microhabitats elsewhere by raising the water table, increasing water seepage, saturating the soil and promoting abundant growth of vegetation. Indoor temperature was relatively stable with higher minima and lower maxima than outdoors and on the average 2. 8 - 3. 4 ºC warmer than outdoors. The warming effect of the dam, together with profuse breeding sites, suitable indoor and outdoor resting microhabitats {{may have contributed to the}} extended and dramatic increased risk of malaria observed in near dam communities in the Ethiopian highlands in Tigray. Most importantly the larval intervention study, which involved minimal community participation, showed a 49 % relative reduction in An. arabiensis abundance in the dam village compared with the pre-intervention period. Thus, if dams could be constructed further away from settlements and if serious and sustainable community-led environmental management measures could be introduced as a package, it would be possible to mitigate the impact of microdams to an appreciable extent and calls for an integrated approach to malaria control, in fringe areas of malaria, such as the Tigray highlands, particularly nearmicrodams.
