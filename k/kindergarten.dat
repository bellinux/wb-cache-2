There are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early childhood Program (EC) for three-year-olds and junior <b>kindergarten</b> (JK) for four-year-olds; the lower school for <b>kindergarten</b> through group four, and middle school for groups five through eight. Each class in <b>kindergarten</b> through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in <b>kindergarten,</b> 8 to 1 in junior <b>kindergarten,</b> and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.|$|E

Coonley {{purchased}} land on Grove Street and commissioned the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton to design the building. The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the <b>Kindergarten</b> Extension Association School in 1912. In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a first grade program was launched at the Downers Grove <b>kindergarten,</b> which was renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a second grade class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a third grade in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a fourth grade for nine-year-old students shortly thereafter.|$|E

Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four-year-olds attend <b>kindergarten.</b> A number of private operators exist, but free state-run institutions are also popular. State-run Maltese kindergartens are required to have one staff member present for every ten children present, while this ratio decreases to 1:20 for independently run institutions. During the <b>kindergarten</b> years, the focus is on play, not formal education. From <b>kindergarten,</b> students transition to primary school, which is compulsory {{from the age}} of five. Since 1980, all state-run primary schools have been co-educational, with many independent schools following suit. However, church-run primary schools are usually single-sex. Classes usually have a limit of thirty students, and a minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1:19 in all schools, whether they be state-run, church-run or independent.|$|E

30|$|<b>Kindergartens</b> {{were more}} {{accessible}} to the public when the Republic of China (ROC) was founded in 1912, as the ‘new government’ encouraged women to join the workforce. Accordingly, the responsibility of caring for and educating young children gradually shifted from the home to <b>kindergartens</b> (Zhu and Wang 2005). Particularly in urban areas, many children tended to spend their whole day in nurseries and <b>kindergartens</b> while their parents worked. To promote ECE in rural and disadvantaged areas, pioneers such as Tao Xingzhi, Chen Heqin, and Zhang Xuemen led the movement to establish most-needed <b>kindergartens</b> for those children residing in factories and rural areas. Thus, many <b>kindergartens</b> {{for the children of}} workers and farmers were established in rural China.|$|R

To achieve this goal, this study analyzed articles of “Youji no Kyoiku (Early Childhood Care and Education) ”.

(2) From mid- 1947 to 1948, as a result of the enactment of the School Education Law and Child Welfare Act, the ECCE system was divided into two distinct forms of institutions: <b>kindergartens</b> and day nurseries, but it was argued at the same time that educational contents of <b>kindergartens</b> and day nurseries should be similar.
