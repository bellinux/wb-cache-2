Over {{the next}} few years, the Association moved the summer program to San Mateo County Council's Camp Cutter in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and later, at {{different}} times, to Marin Council's Camp Marin-Sierra and Yosemite Council's Camp Mensinger in the California Sierra Nevada. They began to attract most youth attendees from the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2014, the Association secured use of Camp Robert L. Cole in the Tahoe National Forest near Cisco Grove, California.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} an {{everyday}} beverage, Turkish coffee is {{also a part of}} the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> although {{in some parts of the}} country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.|$|E

Over the course of the show, Lana transitions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> next door to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman".

[...] Attempts have been made to read a hoodoo significance into the phrase [...] "dust my broom". [...] However, bluesman Big Joe Williams, who knew Johnson and was familiar with folk magic, explained it as [...] "leaving for good... I'm putting you down, I won't be back no more".

500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest and {{it showed}} the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl.</b> Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It".|$|E
500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really {{wanted it to be}} coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> like 'can I get your number' to the guy. But in all honesty that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "November Rain". The scenes of the dead models were described as stomach turning while he complimented the video for [...] "brimming with cinematic style [...] that it's hard to take your eyes off it, though it will likely be labeled as a little self-indulgent." [...] He also commented on the leaking of the video saying that it [...] "warranted {{more than just a}} simple leak; it deserved a red carpet." [...] Anna Pickard from The Guardian complimented the video saying that [...] "quite a lot of work has gone into it". However, she opined that the video was too long. Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, saying it [...] "gives us even more of the next-level cuckoo we've come to expect <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta." [...] The paparazzi theme of the video was compared to Britney Spears's 2004 music video, [...] "Everytime". MTV News called the video a [...] "1940s romantic-epic-style video" [...] that [...] "proves once and for all that Gaga is a true original with a unique vision." [...] The video was nominated for five VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with four other nominations for [...] "Poker Face", she and Beyonc√© were tied for most nominations that year. The video won the award for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects. The music video for Gaga's single [...] "Telephone" [...] is a continuation of the [...] "Paparazzi" [...] music video, and is a short film as well. The video picks up right where [...] "Paparazzi" [...] left off; starting with Gaga in prison.|$|E

Lesions discovered in her brain and eye tissue {{were found to have}} both free and intracellular T. gondii. [...] Infected tissue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> was homogenized and inoculated intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; the animals subsequently developed encephalitis.

She wants him, and there‚Äôs nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa‚Äôs being impulsive. She‚Äôs a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn‚Äôt have with Mark‚Äî passion. You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it‚Äôs happening again.
