40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} load in backpacks and other load carriage systems over the last decades, load carriage system designs have to be adapted accordingly to minimize discomfort and {{to reduce the risk}} of injury. As subject studies are labor-intensive and include further challenges such as intra-subject and inter-subject variability, we aimed to validate an <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> as an objective laboratory tool to assess the mechanical aspects of discomfort. The validation of the <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> was conducted by comparison with a recent subject study. The mechanical parameters that characterize the static and dynamic interaction between backpack and body during different backpack settings were compared. The second aim was to investigate whether high predictive power (coefficient of determination R 2 > 0. 5) in assessing the discomfort of load carriage systems could be reached using the <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy.</b> Measurements were conducted under static conditions, simulating upright standing, and dynamic conditions, simulating level walking. Twelve different configurations of a typical load carriage system, a commercially available backpack with a hip belt, were assessed. The mechanical parameters were measured in the shoulder and the hip region of the dummy and consisted of average pressure, peak pressure, strap force and relative motion between the system and the body. The twelve configurations consisted of three different weights (15 kg, 20 kg, and 25 kg), combined with four different hip belt tensions (30 N, 60 N, 90 N, and 120 N). Through the significant (p< 0. 05) correlation of the mechanical parameters measured on the dummy with the corresponding values of the subject study, the dummy was validated for all static measurements and for dynamic measurements in the hip region to accurately simulate the interaction between the human body and the load carriage system. Multiple linear regressions with the mechanical parameters measured on the dummy as independent variables and the corresponding subjective discomfort scores from the subject study as the dependent variable revealed a high predictive power of the <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy.</b> The dummy can explain 75 % or more of the variance in discomfort using average pressures as predictors and even 79 % or more of the variance in discomfort using strap forces as predictors.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a long debate among {{researchers}} on whether soccer heading is capable of causing brain trauma. A recent study suggests that headings exceeding a threshold level of 855 to 1, 550 per year, results in microstructural abnormalities in the brain's white matter. This shows that brain trauma is caused by cumulative effect of repetitive headings. The use of protective headgear is one of the suggested preventive measures to protect the brain especially for younger players. Researchers have tested several commercial headgears and found that they are only effective in head-to-head impact, but ineffective in attenuating impact caused by heading. This {{is due to the fact}} that soccer ball is compliant in nature relative to the head. The aim of this study is to investigate materials that can be utilised to minimise the acceleration of the brain caused by soccer heading. A vertical drop ball test was conducted on an <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> skull. The inner cavity of the skull is filled with ultrasound gel that represents the brain. Six impact-absorbing materials were tested to determine the most effective material that reduces the acceleration of the brain substitute. The speed of the ball before and after impact as well as impact duration were measured using high-speed camera. Coefficient of restitution was calculated to ensure the material is not only capable of reducing the brain acceleration, but also maintains heading performance. It was found that polymer kneepad foam is the most effective material that minimises the acceleration of brain substitute whilst maintaining the speed of the ball after impact...|$|E
40|$|OBJECT Falls are {{the most}} common {{environmental}} setting for closed head injuries in children between 2 and 4 years of age. The authors previously found that toddlers had fewer skull fractures and scalp/facial soft-tissue injuries, and more frequent altered mental status than infants for the same low-height falls (≤ 3 ft). METHODS To identify potential age-dependent mechanical load factors that may be responsible for these clinical findings, the authors created an <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> representing an 18 -month-old child using published toddler anthropometry and mechanical properties of the skull and neck, and they measured peak angular acceleration during low-height falls (1, 2, and 3 ft) onto carpet pad and concrete. They compared these results from occiput-first impacts to previously obtained values measured in a 6 -week-old infant dummy. RESULTS Peak angular acceleration of the toddler dummy head was largest in the sagittal and horizontal directions and increased significantly (around 2 -fold) with fall height between 1 and 2 ft. Impacts onto concrete produced larger peak angular accelerations and smaller impact durations than those onto carpet pad. When compared with previously measured infant drops, toddler head accelerations were more than double those of the infant from the same height onto the same surface, likely contributing to the higher incidence of loss of consciousness reported in toddlers. Furthermore, the toddler impact forces were larger than those in the infant, but because of the thicker toddler skull, the risk of skull fracture from low-height falls is likely lower in toddlers compared with infants. CONCLUSIONS If similar fracture limits and brain tissue injury thresholds between infants and toddlers are assumed, it is expected that for impact events, the toddler is likely less vulnerable to skull fracture but more vulnerable to neurological impairment compared with the infant...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudies {{have shown}} {{compelling}} evidence that suggests heading soccer ball {{might lead to}} brain trauma. Researchers have attempted to experimentally quantify head acceleration induced by soccer ball heading. A series of linear accelerometers as well as angular accelerometer were used to measure head accelerations. This method however is limited to measuring only head acceleration during the impact. However, {{it is essential to}} analyse the acceleration of the brain in addition to the acceleration of the head that takes place during a soccer-heading manoeuvre. Since the motion of the brain is almost impossible to be quantified experimentally, this work focuses on performing finite element (FE) analysis of soccer heading to study the motions of both the head and the brain during the impact. FE model of soccer ball was developed and validated against published experimental data as well as a more detailed model. Moreover, FE model of human head that consists of the skull, facial bones, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) layer and the brain was also developed and validated against experimental data of blunt impact on human cadaver. Both validated models were assembled to perform the soccer heading simulations. Linear and angular accelerations of the skull and the brain generated are comparable to those of experimental data. However, it has underestimated the angular acceleration due to the absence of neck in the model, but with comparable acceleration profile. Linear and angular accelerations of the brain were found to be almost {{similar to those of the}} head, which is contradictory to our initial hypothesis. Further study such as ball impact on <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> skull is required to corroborate the findings. Nonetheless, the FE models were able to replicate the head accelerations sustained during soccer ball heading satisfactorily. The simulation results show that the models can be employed in finding protective materials that can reduce the accelerations, thus minimising the probability of suffering from long-term brain trauma due to soccer ball heading...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} environmental concern about emission of Green House Gas and government regulations on vehicle safety, vehicle manufacturers, and their suppliers, must turn to new technologies. This {{is the main}} way to help them to achieve the goals of making vehicles lighter and safer. These two targets {{seem to be in}} deep contrast one with the other as increasing expectations from car consumers and the crashworthiness requirements. Nowadays a lot of innovative vehicle technologies are being considered in order to reduce emissions of GHG, such as engine with increased efficiency, less drag losses, regenerative braking systems, lower weight and so on. Lightweight design is becoming an effective way to get higher fuel efficiency and less vehicle emissions in recent years. Some vehicle weight reduction techniques such as vehicle redesign and vehicle downsizing are playing a negative role on both customer comfort and vehicle safety, since vehicle size and safety are linked together. Consequently, research work and car makers design departments are willing to find advanced materials with excellent performances to substitute traditional materials, such as high strength steel, aluminum, magnesium, composite and so on. Composite have many advantages comparing to traditional materials, such as their relatively higher strength and lower weight, better corrosion resistance, better energy absorption in case of impact and so on. But many difficulties are encountered on the way of successful incorporation of huge quantities of composites, which could be divided into some categories: production cost, production volume, design methodologies, joining technology, repair and recycling issues. Also vehicle safety should be discussed when lighter materials are adopted into automobiles. The research activity in this PhD thesis is motivated and drawn from the above stated problems. Vehicle lateral door substructure is the focus point of this study. Vehicle side door is not a simple panel but rather a substructure system which satisfies many different functions. This structure is traditionally built with steel material traditionally. Basically, the door is composed by an outer panel supported by an inner panel where different additional components are placed. Furthermore, nowadays car doors usually have a reinforcing element (side impact beam) placed longitudinally between outer and inner panels which protects the driver and passengers in case of a side impact event. This thesis has developed several composite side door structures for vehicle model Toyota Yaris 2010, considering static design requirements, NVH design criteria and crashworthiness. All the composite models are simulated with numerical tools ABAQUS and LS-DYNA. The original Yaris steel door structure is considered as reference solution in this study and its performance compared with all composite solutions. The first chapter is dedicated to vehicle fuel consumption and emissions in Europe during recent years. Then the chapter discusses the CO_ 2 emission limitations from Euro 1 to Euro 6 for gasoline and diesel passenger cars. The second chapter covers technological strategies adopted by car manufacturers in order to reach vehicle noxious gas emissions and fuel consumption reduction. Lightweight design is the main way considered in this thesis and then advanced materials used to substitute traditional material are summarized. Both advantages and disadvantages of composite materials are discussed in detail; also safety of lighter vehicles is covered briefly in the end. The third chapter introduces the particular application of the vehicle lateral door in the past. In this activity, the differences between finite element model of Yaris and real car are investigated. Active safety and passive safety of vehicle is discussed, usually the passive safety includes frontal crash, side crash and rear crash. Every vehicle fleet must pass not only legislation safety tests before they are permitted to be sold in market but also "New car Assessment Program", all the NCAP established in different countries are summarized. The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214 is the reference normative in the study, which is discussed in deepth. Biomechanical response of <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> is used to assess injury risk of body part, including Head Injury Criteria (HIC), thorax, abdomen and pelvis. At the end, three composite door solutions developed in this study are briefly described. The fourth chapter covers composite characterization; types of fiber and matrix common in use are summarized at first. The selection of composite for vehicle side door should consider bending stiffness, strength and capacity to absorb energy. As a response, several composite materials are considered because of their own advantages, they are carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), E-Glass/epoxy composite (GFRP), glass mat thermoplastic (GMT), GMT-UD, GMT-TEX and semi impregnated micro sandwich material (SIMS). The fifth chapter introduces composite door solutions in detail, such as sizes of models, types of element and so on. The first composite door solution is framed by composite thin-walled beams based on the size of Yaris door. The composite beams are connected by aluminum joint through epoxy adhesives. In this case, outer panel and inner panel of door structure are not considered, so {{it is not possible to}} integrate this solution into Yaris vehicle directly. The second solution is to substitute traditional materials using composite, interesting parts are outer panel, inner panel and impact beam. In third solution, one innovative side door reinforcing structure is presented, the proposal is that traditional impact beam and some particular reinforcements are replaced by an innovative composite reinforcing panel, and this innovative panel could be bonded with outer surface panel and inner surface panel together. The sixth chapter is covering numerical simulation results for first and second solutions under static loading cases, including vertical, horizontal, lateral stiffness, sagging and quasi static intrusion simulation test. At the end the modal analysis is done for second solution. All the numerical results of composite solutions are compared with Yaris reference solution. The crashworthiness evaluation is in chapter seven, including intrusion displacements of compartment and biomechanical response of <b>instrumented</b> <b>dummy</b> which is placed at driver's seat. Acceleration of head, rib deflection, abdominal force and pubic symphysis force are used to assess the injury risk of body parts. All the biomechanical response of composite solutions are compared with steel reference solution and limitation value required in regulation FMVSS 214.

40|$|Robotic {{systems for}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery often are limited in diversity of instruments. However during manual laparoscopic procedures surgeons use a large variety of instruments and change them up to 80 times. Within the Fraunhofer project "WholeO'Hand" this challenge has been addressed and an automated exchange system has been developed. Methods: Based on {{an analysis of the}} surgical situation a product development procedure has been performed. The process resulted in an overall concept for an instrument exchange system (IES). The main idea is the capsular design of the instruments and their movement inside a working tube by a hydraulic mechanism. The working tube peaks through the abdominal wall of the patient and stays there during the procedure. Outside the body a storage cylinder can keep up to five different surgical instruments in separate chambers. An exchange sequence works as follows. From the distal end of the working tube capsule "A" gets "sucked" into its storage chamber. An actuation unit turns the storage cylinder and aligns instrument "B" with the working tube. Hydraulic pressure then moves the capsule to the distal end of the tube. Results: Based on the described concept a prototype of the system has been designed and realized. The storage cylinder is made out of PEEK and shows dimensions of Ø 80 x 175 mm. The working tube is made of stainless steel and has an outer diameter of Ø 16 mm with a total length of 300 mm. The actuation unit consists of two autoclavable electric motors and has been tested successfully. In first experiments capsular <b>instrument</b> <b>dummies</b> have reliably been exchanged. Conclusion: Concept, realisation and promising experimental results of an IES have been described.

The results suggest that non-means-tested regimes do not affect wives' participation whereas means-tested regimes all lower wives participation rates, given their characteristics.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on the determinants of economic growth has typically neglected the influence of religion. To fill this gap, we use international survey data on religiosity for a broad panel of countries to investigate the effects of church attendance and religious beliefs on economic growth. To isolate the direction of causation from religiosity to economic performance, we use instrumental variables suggested by our analysis of systems in which church attendance and beliefs are the dependent variables. The <b>instruments</b> are <b>dummy</b> variables {{for the presence of}} state religion and for regulation of the religion market, an indicator of religious pluralism, and the composition of religions. We find that economic growth responds positively to the extent of religious beliefs, notably those in hell and heaven, but negatively to church attendance. That is, growth depends on the extent of believing relative to belonging. These results accord with a perspective in which religious beliefs influence individual traits that enhance economic performance. The beliefs are, in turn, the principal output of the religion sector, and church attendance measures the inputs to this sector. Hence, for given beliefs, more church attendance signifies more resources used up by the religion sector. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a {{weighted}} average of a forward and reverse Jackknife IV estimator (JIVE) yields estimators that are robust against heteroscedasticity and many instruments. These estimators, called HFUL (Heteroscedasticity robust Fuller) and HLIM (Heteroskedasticity robust limited information maximum likelihood (LIML)) were introduced by Hausman et al. (2012), but without derivation. Combining consistent estimators is {{a theme that}} is associated with Jerry Hausman and, therefore, we present this derivation in this volume. Additionally, and in order to further understand and interpret HFUL and HLIM in the context of jackknife type variance ratio estimators, we show that a new variant of HLIM, under specific grouped data settings with <b>dummy</b> <b>instruments,</b> simplifies to the Bekker and van der Ploeg (2005) MM (method of moments) estimator. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} and increasing controversy around microcredit {{has given rise}} to the need for rigorous evaluation of its welfare impact. We collected pre- (299) and post-treatment (209) survey data to determine the impacts of a group loan with individual liability on indicators of household welfare in NTT province, Indonesia. Because of the lack of statistical significance of impact estimates due to the short follow-up period of only one year, we focus disproportionally on methodological issues. The main challenge of an evaluation of non-randomized programs, as in our setting, is endogenous treatment selection. We focus on nonparametric methods when dealing with attrition and selection bias. We propose a novel nonparametric test of instrument validity in a general recursive model. In contrast to existing overidentifying restriction tests for linear IV models such as the well-known Sargan test, our test is consistent even when none of the instruments to be tested is valid and can thus be applied when only one instrumental variable is available. This and other tests failed to refute the validity of our new <b>instrument,</b> a <b>dummy</b> indicating whether the household has at least one treated or previously treated acquaintance, when a wealth index was the outcome. Our main finding is that take-up of TLM's group loan has a negative short-term impact on household wealth, indicating loan-induced distress sales of assets.
