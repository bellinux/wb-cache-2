25|$|The Lowe {{process is}} a three-stage {{modified}} water gas process in which 'blue' water gas is modified by addition of pyrolized oils to render a yellow flame usable for <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> as well as heating. Blue water gas is a term used for water gas produced from clean burning fuels such as anthracite, coke and charcoal and produces a blue flame.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is produced}} from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds; it forms {{when there is}} not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Coal gas, which was widely used before the 1960s for <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting,</b> cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as iron smelting, still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting.</b> Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
500|$|Neon's {{scarcity}} precluded its prompt {{application for}} lighting {{along the lines}} of Moore tubes, which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company, Air Liquide, produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business. In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon. Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting,</b> due to their intensity, but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color. In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful. Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition. The intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with American society at the time, suggesting a [...] "century of progress" [...] and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and [...] "electro-graphic architecture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historian A. Roger Ekirch {{thinks that}} the {{traditional}} pattern of [...] "segmented sleep," [...] as it is called, began to disappear among the urban upper class in Europe in the late 17th century and the change spread over the next 200 years; by the 1920s [...] "the idea of a first and second sleep had receded entirely from our social consciousness." [...] Ekirch attributes the change to increases in [...] "street lighting, <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> and a surge in coffee houses," [...] which slowly made nighttime a legitimate time for activity, decreasing the time available for rest. Today in most societies people sleep during the night, but in very hot climates they may sleep during the day. During Ramadan, many Muslims sleep during the day rather than at night.|$|E

2500|$|Westinghouse's {{interests}} in gas distribution and telephone switching [...] {{led him to}} become interested in the then new field of electrical power distribution in the early 1880s. Electric lighting was a growing business with many companies building outdoor direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) arc lighting based street lighting systems and Thomas Edison launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb. In 1884 he started developing his own DC <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> system and hired physicist William Stanley to work on it. Westinghouse {{became aware of the}} new European alternating current systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. AC had the ability to be [...] "stepped up" [...] in voltage by a transformer for distribution long distances and then [...] "stepped down" [...] by a transformer for consumer use allowing large centralized power plants to supply electricity long distance in cities with more disperse populations. This was an advantage over the low voltage DC systems being marketed by Thomas Edison's electric utility which had a limited range due to the low voltages used. Westinghouse saw AC's potential to achieve greater economies of scale as way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.|$|E
2500|$|Edison's {{direct current}} {{generation}} dominated the initial years of indoor commercial and residential electric lighting and electric power distribution. However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing voltages between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor transmission efficiency. The mid 1880s saw {{the introduction of the}} transformer, allowing alternating current to be transmitted at high voltage long distances with greater efficiency and then [...] "stepped down" [...] to supply commercial and domestic indoor lighting, resulting in AC going from being the outdoor [...] "arc lighting current" [...] to taking over the <b>domestic</b> <b>lighting</b> utility market Edison's DC system was designed to supply. The rapid spread of AC and haphazard instillation of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current. Starting in 1888 the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a parallel goal to limit, to the point of ineffectiveness, the voltages in AC power systems, a market then dominated by Westinghouse Electric. This series of events {{came to be known as}} the War of Currents. Brown/Edison's lobbying in state legislatures went nowhere and the Edison company continued to lose market share and profitability to the AC based companies. In 1892 the [...] "war" [...] ended with Thomas Edison losing any remaining control of his own company when it was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to form General Electric, creating a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse's lead in AC development would allow them to win a contract in 1893 to build an AC based power station at the Niagara Falls but the transmission contract was awarded to General Electric, who would come to dominate the US electrical business for many years afterwards.|$|E

50|$|The GAZ-24 {{continued}} to be produced until 1985, when {{using some of the}} technical developments of GAZ-3102 was deeply modified, resulting in the GAZ-24-10. Starting with 24-10 the Volga began a slow transformation as the Perestroika reforms took shape. Though still remaining a status car, it quickly lost that prestige as market economy allowed free import of automobiles. However its simple and robust design and still good quality assembly, and the lack of a <b>domestic</b> <b>Light</b> Commercial Vehicle the GAZ-24-10 was quickly seized by the new generation of commerce.|$|R
2500|$|Solid-state or {{semiconductor}} dimmers {{were introduced}} to solve some of these problems. [...] Semiconductor dimmers switch on at an adjustable time (phase angle) {{after the start of}} each alternating current half-cycle, thereby altering the voltage waveform applied to lamps and so changing its RMS effective value. Because they switch instead of absorbing part of the voltage supplied, there is very little wasted power. Dimming can be almost instantaneous and is easily controlled by remote electronics. [...] This development also made it possible to make dimmers small enough to be used in place (within the pattress) of normal <b>domestic</b> <b>light</b> switches.|$|R
