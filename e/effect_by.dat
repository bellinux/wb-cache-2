5|$|An {{electronic}} {{toll collection}} system was proposed in 1990 where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device which would be read from an electronic tollbooth; the motorist would be billed later.

5|$|By the 12th century Middle English {{was fully}} developed, {{integrating}} both Norse and Norman features; {{it continued to}} be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500.

In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> authors such as Chaucer.|$|E

Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> an act of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th century, the navy, {{like the}} Empire itself, began to decline. Faced with new naval {{challenges}} from the West, the Byzantines were increasingly forced {{to rely on}} the navies of Italian city-states like Venice and Genoa, with disastrous effects on Byzantium's economy and sovereignty. A period of recovery under the Komnenians was followed by another period of decline, which culminated in the disastrous dissolution of the Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. After the Empire was restored in 1261, several emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty tried to revive the navy, but their efforts had only a temporary <b>effect.</b> <b>By</b> the mid-14th century, the Byzantine fleet, which once could put hundreds of warships to sea, was limited to a few dozen at best, and control of the Aegean passed definitively to the Italian and Ottoman navies. The diminished navy, however, continued to be active until the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{independent}} Apple resellers filed {{a lawsuit}} against Apple alleging the company used misleading advertising practices by using unfair business practices that harmed the resellers' sales while boosting Apple-owned outlets, in <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> favoring its own outlets over those of its resellers. The lawsuit claimed that Apple favored company-owned stores by providing significant discounts unavailable to independent dealers. The complaint alleged Apple's acts in favoring its own stores constituted breach of contract, false advertising, fraud, trade libel, defamation, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. , Apple reached settlements with all of the plaintiffs, including the bankruptcy trustee for one reseller that failed, while the former principal of that company appealed the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|Lancastrian cognatic {{descent from}} John of Gaunt and Blanche's {{daughter}} Phillipa {{continued in the}} royal houses of Spain and Portugal. The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament {{during the reign of}} Richard II. Henry IV had tried to debar them from the succession by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne but this was of limited <b>effect.</b> <b>By</b> some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what some might claim a better right to the throne.

Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide.

5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their <b>effect</b> <b>by</b> being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
