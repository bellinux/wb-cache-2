A dial {{to the left side}} of the gunner's eyepiece served for selecting of the x3.5 times to x7 times zoom. The gunner could turn on the sight illumination during night time, which made the distance and aiming markings become visible in red against the dark background of the night. For accurate shooting during the night the gunner could use his TPN-1 device working on the active infrared principle. It is an electro-optical monocular telescope with a x5.5 times zoom and 6 degree field of view. Its effective range of illumination is 600-800 meters. When firing the main gun, an automatic screen is closed for a short time. Otherwise, observation with the TPN would be impossible due to the bright flash. In addition, the light from the muzzle flash can burn out the <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> of the picture converter which will make the TPN useless. The TPN is connected with the stabilized parts of the main gun. Therefore accurate aiming on the move during the night is possible as well. A big floodlight (the L2AG, the so-called Luna floodlight) is placed on the right side of the turret, with an elbow fastened to the stabilised main gun and serves for the purpose field lighting. With this fixture the floodlight always follows the movement of the cannon, yet has to be calibrated to shine into the center chevrons of the TPN sight. For this some periodic crew work is required. The shooting with the TPN was relatively easy. There was the main triangular chevron in the center of the reticle. Its upper tip represented where the BR-412 APHE would land at a 700 meter range, and where the machine gun rounds would land at 500 meter range. Many variants of the TPN-1 were adopted for the T-64, T-72 and even T-80 tanks with improved active and possible passive night vision.|$|E

The reported work focused {{on the effects of}} the CO 2 /SiH 4 ratio on the properties of p-μc-SiO:H films and the effectiveness of the films as an <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> of crystalline silicon heterojunction (c-Si-HJ) solar cells. A p-μc-SiO:H film with a wide optical band gap (E 04), 2. 1 [*]eV, can be obtained by increasing the CO 2 /SiH 4 ratio; however, the tradeoff between E 04 and dark conductivity must be considered.

40|$|Comparison of the {{open-circuit}} voltage Voc determined by sunsVoc to the implied voltage Voc,impl determined by transient QSSPC lifetime measurements {{can lead to}} a quick and easy analysis and characterization of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, especially in regard to finding the optimum doping concentration of the <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> (stack system). The Voc,impl represents the interface passivation quality. The sunsVoc value gives us additionally a measure of the apparent band-bending. Increasing the concentration of doping gases during the deposition of e. g. a-Si:H(p) reduces the interface passivation quality (Voc,impl) and increases the band-bending (sunsVoc value). The best trade off is realized when the ratio of sunsVoc to Voc,impl (Voc trade off) first comes to a saturation value near 1, while increasing the doping concentration. For a-Si:H(p) layers the pseudo fill factor PFF is found to be dependent on the doping concentration, too. Thus, the maximum value obtained for the PFF sunsVoc product is taken as a measure for the optimal doping concentration of a-Si:H(p) emitter layers. This approaches are applied to answer the following questions: i) what is the optimum doping concentration for an a-Si:H(n) <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> vs. an a-Si:H(i & n) <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> stack? ii) what is the best doping concentration of the a-Si:H(p) layer in an a- Si:H(i & p) <b>emitter</b> <b>layer</b> stack system including a variation of the a-Si:H(i) as well as the a-Si:H(p) layer thickness...|$|E

Dielectric film deposition at low temperature (≤ 400 ºC) is widely used for c-Si surface passivation and in this case emitters are induced by the positive fixed charge, Qf, at the c-Si/dielectric interface. In this work, we use 2 -D simulations to explore solar cell structures with inversion <b>layer</b> <b>emitters</b> placed between local n+-emitters.
