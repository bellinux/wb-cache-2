40|$|Enterobacter hormaechei {{was first}} {{identified}} as a unique species in 1989. Between 29 November 1992 and 17 March 1993, an outbreak of E. hormaechei occurred among premature infants {{in the intensive care}} nursery (ICN) at The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The 10 infants whose cultures were positive for E. hormaechei (six were infected and four were colonized) had a lower median estimated gestational age and birth weight than did other ICN infants; other risk factors for infection or colonization with E. hormaechei were not identified. Cultures from three <b>isolettes</b> and a doorknob in the ICN were positive for E. hormaechei. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of isolates from six patients and two <b>isolettes</b> were identical. Observations of health care workers revealed breaks in infection control techniques that may have allowed transmission of this organism. We found that E. hormaechei is a nosocomial pathogen that can infect vulnerable hospitalized patients and that can be transmitted from patient to patient when infection control techniques are inadequate. Enterobacter hormaechei was ®rst identi®ed as a unique ing through a 0. 45 -m ®lter, and placing the ®lter on MacConkey agar. species in 1989 [1]. In this initial report, most clinical isolates came from blood, wounds, or sputum. Additional reports of Available E. hormaechei isolates were sent to the Center...|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{remodeling}} {{project in the}} McKay early in 1973 on the second floor. It included addition of two more private labor rooms {{for a total of}} ten, and all labor rooms were enlarged to accommodate fetal heart monitoring equipment. The capacity of the Intensive Care Nursery was increased to eight <b>isolettes,</b> and a high risk delivery room was created adjacent to the ICN. A recovery area for mothers following delivery was added in the post-partum wing, and a fathers' waiting room was built. Total cost of the remodeling was $250,000.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970s brought {{additional}} advancements {{in technology}} and services to Home Hospital. The hospital, which had 365 beds, 35 bassinets and nine <b>isolettes,</b> celebrated {{the launch of the}} neonatal intensive care unit in July 1975. Other happenings from 1975 included the Auxiliary providing $59,242.96 to Home Hospital, a bulk of that from the Home Hospital Fair, the gift shop and other events. Their main goal was to complete their pledge of $500,000 for the building fund. The report also included that [...] "Home Hospital’s Red Coats, the first all-male organization of hospital volunteers in the world, celebrated their 10th anniversary." ...|$|R
50|$|Other medical leaps {{during this}} period {{included}} the hospital’s first neurosurgeon in 1967, cobalt therapy in 1968, and the hospital’s new Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory with a physician as full-time director opening in 1969. Additional construction in 1968 yielded a new Newborn Nursery Suite. It contained a nursery for well babies, an observation area, and an Intensive Care Nursery. Equipment included monitors for heart rate and respiration of the newborn, an infant X-ray machine, and a transport <b>isolette</b> with its own battery power so that newborns could be transported safety between hospitals.|$|E
50|$|The next year, Bloxsom and Angelique {{published}} {{an article in the}} American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology on the 48-hour mortality rate among newborns at St. Joseph. Between 1949 and 1952, this rate had decreased from 63 per 10,000 infants to 37 per 10,000 infants. Bloxsom and Angelique cited the air lock device as a contributor to the improvement in outcomes. However, a 1956 study from Johns Hopkins Hospital failed to show a significant difference in outcomes between infants treated in the Bloxsom air lock versus those cared for in the <b>Isolette</b> brand of incubator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{premature}} and congenitally ill infants {{is not a}} new one. As early as the 17th and 18th centuries, there were scholarly papers published that attempted to share knowledge of interventions. It was not until 1922, however, that hospitals started grouping the newborn infants into one area, now called the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Before the industrial revolution, premature and ill infants were born and cared for at home and either lived or died without medical intervention. [...] In the mid-nineteenth century, the infant incubator was first developed, based on the incubators used for chicken eggs. [...] Dr. Stephane Tarnier is generally considered to be the father of the incubator (or <b>isolette</b> as it is now known), having developed it to attempt to keep premature infants in a Paris maternity ward warm. Other methods had been used before, {{but this was the first}} closed model; in addition, he helped convince other physicians that the treatment helped premature infants. France became a forerunner in assisting premature infants, in part due to its concerns about a falling birth rate.|$|E
50|$|After delivery, plastic wraps or warm {{mattresses}} {{are useful}} {{to keep the}} infant warm {{on their way to}} the NICU. In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators (also called <b>isolettes),</b> which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality. Bili lights may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).|$|R
40|$|Island’s {{regional}} {{high risk}} maternal and neonatal referral center, opened the nation’s largest single family room neo-natal {{intensive care unit}} (NICU) in Sep-tember 2009. Housed in the adjacent newly constructed South Pavilion, this 50, 000 square foot 80 -bed NICU fea-tures family-centered care. Parents, now able to stay at their baby’s bedside 24 hours per day, can expect less stress than in the traditional chaotic NICU, 1, 2 fewer catheter-related infections, 3 and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes with normalization of noise and light stimulation. 4 THE CHALLENGE The prospect of transitioning from a 10, 000 square foot open bay model (with prams, <b>isolettes,</b> and warmers clus-tered in six bays) to a unit 5 times larger with a single family room ‘model of care’ was daunting. Our system had evolved over decades with refinements from generations of caregivers. That system was built on processes that were effi-cient, with redundancies for patient safety. Now, {{over the course of}} months, new processes would need to promote that same level of patient care. For ex-ample, physicians in the older model could readily identify the pulse of the bay with a quick scan, and neighboring nurses easily shared responsibility for each other’s patients. In the new unit, staff would function in single, twin and triplet rooms spread over two floors, the combined size of a football field. How would staff be alerted and respond to acute situations? Multidisciplinary workflow commit-tees formed to wrestle with many the changes and unknowns. Preemptive changes, both strategic and procedural, were implemented as far in advance as possible, such as enhanced nurse practi-tioner coverage and delivery phone us-age. But many best practices were elu-sive without a full understanding of how systems would come together. Despit...|$|R
40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: Final {{shocking}} of eggs {{was finished}} in the incubation. Egg enumeration for the 2008 brood was completed and the eggs are being incubated in 38 degree Fahrenheit chilled water. Don Larsen of NOAA made a request of eggs for research purposes {{and was able to}} acquire supplemental line eggs 10, 555. Estimated density at the time of ponding in Mid-March of 2009 is approximately 43, 869 fry per raceway after calculating an average fry loss of 2 %. The end of the month totals for the 2007 brood reports 773, 807 juveniles on hand with an overall average of 31. 4 fish per pound. Tagging continues on the 2007 brood and is on pace to wrap up in early December. FISH CULTURE: Ponds are cleaned as needed and due to the colder water temperatures, the feeding frequency has been changed to three days a week. All ponds are sampled {{at the end of the}} month. Growth for production fish are adjusted accordingly as temperature dictates feeding levels. Torrential rain on the 12 th turned the Yakima River extremely turbid. Fish tagging operations were halted and the ensuing conditions at the facility intake screens became a concern. Water flow to the wet well became restricted so the decision was made to shut the surface water (river) pumps down and turn on well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 to run water to the facility head box. This operation continued for twenty-four hours at which point normal operations were optimal and fish tagging resumed, although the river didn't clear up enough to feed the fish until the 17 th. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 822 gallons/minute. Well No. 2 is pumping water at a rate of 530 gallons per minute. All four river pumps are in operation and pumping 14, 292 gallons/minute. ACCLIMATION SITES: Cle Elum staff has been working to prep the acclimation sites for the upcoming fish transfer before the snow falls. Thermographs at each site are changed weekly. AMB Tools performed routine maintenance on the compressor and Brown and Jackson pumped out the septic tank at the Jack Creek acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: Snow tires are now on all vehicles and snow blowers were installed on the John Deere tractor and lawn tractor. The snowplow was also installed on the Ford one ton. The four Snowmobiles were serviced by Yamaha Jacks of Ellensburg. MAINTENANCE BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Clean up occurs on Fridays of each week. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Water has been turned on to vertical incubator islands one and two. After eggs were transferred to vertical stacks cleaning of troughs began. WDFW crew inventoried eggs from <b>isolettes</b> and then transferred them to the vertical incubators. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four pumps are in operation and supplying the facility with 14, 292 gallons/minute of water to rearing ponds. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 were turned on to supplement water flow to the facility as mentioned previously. Well No. 5 was powered up but a winterizing valve malfunction wouldn't allow operation, we are currently working on it at this time. Well No. 2 is pumping 530 gallons per minute and supplies well water to incubation and chiller. The pumps meter is recorded weekly. Test holes are monitored weekly and results are faxed to CH 2 MHILL afterward. SAFETY AND TRAINING: Ice melt and sand bags are popular items at the facility this month as freezing temperatures cause ground to become slippery and hazardous. GROUNDS: Van Alden's Plumbing installed a new commode in resident house No. 411 and also inspected a plumbing problem at resident No. 1131. Cle Elum staff along with WDFW staff worked to locate the spawning channel building back to the position it was at to have Greg Wallace of Wallace Electric hook electricity back up to the spawning shed. MEETINGS AND TOURS: Charlie attended a policy meeting at Cle Elum on the 18 th. The Internal projects annual review took place at Cle Elum on the 19 th and 20 th. Bill Bosch continues to visit monthly to incorporate data into the YKFP data base. PERSONNEL: IHS employees traveled to Cle Elum to administer flu shots to YN staffers and families as well as WDFW staffers...|$|R
50|$|Her {{doctoral}} research began {{a lifelong}} study {{of early childhood}} development. Barnard's research focused on the mother-child relationship, especially with regards to neonates. She discovered that rocking chairs and listening to heartbeats could help infants; this research caused hospitals to install rocking chairs in labor and delivery and neonatal units. Her parent-child interaction scale was invented to show the effect that these interactions could have on development in various realms. Barnard is responsible for founding Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST), which offers evidence based training programs to both parent and health care provider. Through the NCAST program, the Parent-Child Interaction Feeding and Teaching Scales (PCI) evolved. It was the first parent-child interaction tool in clinical research {{and continues to be}} the gold standard in practice today to determine a child's cognitive development. She was part of the team that invented the <b>isolette,</b> a neonatal incubator that rocks in order to support sensorimotor development and weight gain. Her research also showed that physical contact was essential for infant development. Her research also included interventions for children who were at risk of future problems due to their environment.|$|E
50|$|When the {{transport}} {{is beyond the}} range of the helicopter, or when weather precludes flight to a location, a fixed-wing aircraft is called into service. Flight For Life partners with Mayo Aviation, Inc. at Centennial Airport in Englewood, Colorado for a dedicated Beechcraft Super King Air 200. This pressurized, twin turboprop aircraft is capable of instrument flight (IFR) at a speed of 265 nmi km per hour (knots), and is used for flights of up to approximately 800 mi round trip distance. The pilots are all proficient in multi-engine and instrument flight. Outfitted in a dedicated air medical configuration, the KingAir is capable of transporting any combination of two adult patients, one adult and an <b>isolette,</b> or two isolettes. On most flights, at least one family member is also able to fly along. The bases in Colorado Springs and Pueblo, Colorado do not have dedicated fixed-wing aircraft. When the weather makes helicopter flight impossible, the aircraft from Mayo Aviation may be sent to them to help move a critical patient.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{stress that}} results from preterm birth, {{requisite}} acute care and prolonged physical separation in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can have adverse physiological/psychological effects on both the infant and the mother. In particular, the experience compromises the establishment and maintenance of optimal mother-infant relationship, the subsequent development of the infant, and the mother's emotional well-being. These findings highlight the importance of investigating early interventions {{that are designed to}} overcome or reduce the effects of these environmental insults and challenges. Methods This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with blinded assessment comparing Standard Care (SC) with a novel Family Nurture Intervention (FNI). FNI targets preterm infants born 26 - 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and their mothers in the NICU. The intervention incorporates elements of mother-infant interventions with known efficacy and organizes them under a new theoretical context referred to collectively as calming activities. This intervention is facilitated by specially trained Nurture Specialists in three ways: 1) In the <b>isolette</b> through calming interactions between mother and infant via odor exchange, firm sustained touch and vocal soothing, and eye contact; 2) Outside the <b>isolette</b> during holding and feeding via the Calming Cycle; and 3) through family sessions designed to engage help and support the mother. In concert with infant neurobehavioral and physiological assessments from birth through 24 months corrected age (CA), maternal assessments are made using standard tools including anxiety, depression, attachment, support systems, temperament as well as physiological stress parameters. Quality of mother-infant interaction is also assessed. Our projected enrolment is 260 families (130 per group). Discussion The FNI is designed to increase biologically important activities and behaviors that enhance maternally-mediated sensory experiences of preterm infants, as well as infant-mediated sensory experiences of the mother. Consequently, we are enlarging the testing of preterm infant neurodevelopment beyond that of previous research to include outcomes related to mother-infant interactions and mother-infant co-regulation. Our primary objective is to determine whether repeated engagement of the mother and her infant in the intervention's calming activities will improve the infant's developmental trajectory with respect to multiple outcomes. Our secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of FNI in the physiological and psychological co-regulation of the mother and infant. We include aspects of neurodevelopment that have not been comprehensively measured in previous NICU interventions. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01439269 </p...|$|E

Who will benefit: Radiologists, sonographers, physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and referring physicians interested in body imaging {{will benefit from the}} information in this educational activity and can receive Continuing Medical Education credit by completing the post-test and evaluation provided. Both logistical and clinical factors make the imaging of newborn infants a challenging task. The newborn is an (understandably) uncooperative patient, incapable of following directions such as “hold your breath ” or “remain still. ” Thus, cross-sectional modalities such as CT or MRI that require cooperation for optimal image quality are difficult to apply. Even low-dose ionizing radiation is potentially harmful for neonates, particularly when serial exams are required. Finally, transportation of sick newborns to an imaging suite, particularly those infants requiring intensive care and <b>isolette</b> housing, is often very difficult, if not impossible. Sonography overcomes these challenges and provides several advantages. While many neonatal organ systems are amenable to sonographic evaluation, brain imaging is a particularly attractive application.

40|$|Objective: Pain in {{neonates}} can {{be associated}} with various risks. So, it seems essential to find a simple and acceptable method for relieving pain. Pharmacologic agents are not recommended in neonates for pain relief in minor procedures but nonpharmacologic interventions like Kangaroo Care (KC) is found to be effective. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of KC on physiologic responses to the pain of an intramuscular injection of vitamin K in term neonates. Material & Methods: One hundred healthy term neonates were enrolled for this study during 2 months. The inclusion criteria were gestational age 37 - 42 weeks, normal vaginal delivery, birth weight 2500 - 4000 gr, age more than 2 hours and Apgar score more than 7 at 1 minute. They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, the neonate was held in KC for 10 minutes before the injection until 3 minutes after injection.  In the control group, the neonate was in the prone position in the <b>isolette.</b> The primary outcome measures were heart rate and blood oxygen saturation rate before, during and 3 minutes after injection. Findings: The heart rate during and 3 minutes after injection for neonates given KC were significantly lower than for neonates in control group (P< 0. 001). The blood oxygen saturation rate during and 3 minutes after injection for neonates given KC were significantly higher than for neonates in control group (P< 0. 001).  Conclusion: KC given before injection seems to effectively decrease pain from injection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE In-hospital {{transmission}} of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) among neonates remains enigmatic. We describe the epidemiology of MSSA colonization and infection in a 30 -bed neonatal ward. DESIGN Multimodal outbreak investigation SETTING A public 800 -bed tertiary care university hospital in Switzerland METHODS Investigations in 2012 - 2013, {{triggered by a}} MSSA infection cluster, included prospective MSSA infection surveillance, microbiologic screening of neonates and environment, onsite observations, and a prospective cohort study. MSSA isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and selected isolates were examined for multilocus sequence type (MLST) and virulence factors. RESULTS Among 726 in 2012, 30 (4. 1 %) patients suffered from MSSA infections including 8 (1. 1 %) with bacteremia. Among 655 admissions in 2013, 13 (2. 0 %) suffered from MSSA infections including 2 (0. 3 %) with bacteremia. Among 177 neonates screened for S. aureus carriage, overall 77 (44 %) tested positive. A predominant PFGE- 1 -ST 30 strain was identified in 6 of 30 infected neonates (20 %) and 30 of 77 colonized neonates (39 %). This persistent clone was pvl-negative, tst-positive and belonged to agr group III. We found no environmental point source. MSSA carriage was associated with central vascular catheter use but not with a particular midwife, nurse, physician, or <b>isolette.</b> Observed healthcare worker behavior may have propagated transmission via hands and fomites. Despite multimodal interventions, clonal transmission and colonization continued and another clone, PFGE- 6 -ST 5, became predominant. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-acquired MSSA clones represent {{a high proportion of}} MSSA colonization but not MSSA infections in neonate inpatients. In contrast to persisting MSSA, transmission infection rates decreased concurrently with interventions. It remains to be established whether eradication of hospital-acquired MSSA strains would reduce infection rates further. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2015; 00 (0) : 1 - 8...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus flavus {{is second}} to A. fumigatus {{as a cause}} of {{invasive}} aspergillosis, but no standard method exists for molecular typing of strains from human sources. A repetitive DNA sequence cloned from A. flavus and subcloned into a pUC 19 vector, pAF 28, was used to type 18 isolates from diverse clinical, environmental, and geographic sources. The restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated with EcoRI- or PstI-digested genomic DNA and probed with digoxigenin-labeled pAF 28 revealed complete concordance between patterns. Eighteen distinct fingerprints were observed. The probe was used to investigate two cases of cutaneous A. flavus infection in low-birth-weight infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Both infants were transported by the same ambulance and crew to the NICU on the same day. A. flavus strains of the same genotype were isolated from both infants, from a roll of tape used to fasten their umbilical catheters, from a canvas bag used to store the tape in the ambulance, and from the tape tray in the ambulance <b>isolette.</b> These cases highlight the need to consider exposures in critically ill neonates that might occur during their transport to the NICU and for stringent infection control practices. The hybridization profiles of strains from a second cluster of invasive A. flavus infections in two pediatric hematology-oncology patients revealed a genotype common to strains from a definite case patient and a health care worker. A probable case patient was infected with a strain with a genotype {{different from that of the}} strain from the definite case patient but highly related to that of an environmental isolate.

40|$|Late preterm newborns (LPNs), {{those with}} gestational ages (GAs) between 34 weeks and 36 weeks 6 days, account for 70 % of preterm births. Because {{they have a}} mature {{appearance}} and are often cared for in a well baby nursery (WBN), parents may anticipate that the nursery course will be {{similar to that of}} a term infant and that their newborn will be discharged with his/her mother. How frequently their hospitalizations are prolonged beyond that of their mothers and the morbidities associated with prolonged hospitalization (PH) have not been well described. The objectives of the study were to (1) determine the proportion of LPNs with a PH and (2) describe the most common morbidities in LPNs and identify those associated with PH. The authors conducted retrospective chart reviews of the neonatal courses of LPNs born between December 2002 and April 2007 at the University of Utah Hospital. They compared maternal and newborn discharge dates to determine the proportion of LPNs with a PH and calculated frequencies of conditions and interventions indicating morbidity and identified associations between each of the conditions/interventions and PH. Of 235 LPNs, 94 (40 %) had a PH; 75 % of 34 -week LPNs had a PH compared with 50 % of those with GAs of 35 weeks and 25 % of those with GAs of 36 weeks. The most common conditions/interventions were an oxygen need, phototherapy for jaundice, and hypothermia requiring an <b>isolette.</b> A need for nasogastric feeding and antibiotic administration for> 3 days was consistently associated with a PH. LPNs whose only intervention was phototherapy for jaundice or IV antibiotics for < 3 days did not have a PH.
