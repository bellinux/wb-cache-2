5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard, one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered recumbent effigies. The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. The churchyard also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. The churchyard contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some people}} do not exhibit a {{preference}} for one type of <b>hand</b> <b>clasping,</b> most do. Once adopted, the method of <b>hand</b> <b>clasping</b> tends to be consistent throughout life. When an individual attempts to <b>clasp</b> the <b>hands</b> in the opposite configuration from the usual one, that person may feel a sense that something {{is out of the}} ordinary.|$|R

25|$|There is a pietà at {{the base}} of the central cross showing the Virgin Mary distraught and in tears with the body of Jesus across her knee, her <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> together. She is {{surrounded}} by St John and Mary Magdalene. The pietà was the work of Bastien Prigent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the scene}} {{depicting}} the courtege accompanying Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary/Golgotha we see three women following {{at the end}} of the procession, the first of whom has her <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer.

25|$|The {{entry into}} Jerusalem. Jesus rides on an ass and is {{accompanied}} by five of his disciples, one of whom holds a book. A small figure emerges from the nearby tower and lays a rug in Jesus' path whilst another, his <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> together, stands {{in the door of}} the fortress of Jerusalem, here represented by a small crenelated tower.|$|E
25|$|Dressed {{in black}} and set against a muted green background, the sisters are seen in a doorway. Bessie stands in front, her arms down and <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in front of her. Clara stands {{directly}} behind, and wraps her left hand around Bessie's waist while resting her upraised right hand on the entryway's frame. The sisters are noble in comportment and remote in expression. The unusual positioning of their figures implies a complex and intimate relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{figures in}} the four panels of the lower {{register}} are all positioned within uniform niches. The outer panels show the donors Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The inner panels contain grisaille paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. The grisaille is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which the donors kneel, gazing into the distance with their <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> together in veneration. As with {{the most of the}} other panels on the inner and outer views, they are lit from the right. Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth, and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches.|$|E

25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
500|$|Monument 29 and Monument 30 {{are heavily}} eroded {{columnar}} sculptures fashioned from schist, each measuring {{a little over}} [...] in length. They were found together in a modern drainage ditch {{to the north and}} northwest of the ceremonial centre of Quiriguá. They apparently were sculptures of anthropomorphs or monkeys standing on pedestals with their <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> on their chests. It is thought on stylistic grounds that these two monuments date to the Late Preclassic.|$|E

500|$|Netherlandish diptychs tend to {{illustrate}} {{only a small}} range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child, reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion. The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child. The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the [...] "place of honour" [...] alongside the divine.|$|E
500|$|The [...] tall Faith, to {{the right}} of Charity, is holding a Eucharistic chalice; the [...] tall Charity is holding a {{cornucopia}} and a brazier (or flaming vase); and the [...] tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer. The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the [...] "immediacy" [...] of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever {{you give}} me, you know I'm thankful!" [...] says Honeyman, in a sweet sad voice, {{to the two}} ladies, who were {{standing}} looking at him, the mother's <b>hand</b> <b>clasped</b> in the daughter's.|$|R

50|$|Based on the {{comparison}} {{of a series of}} monozygotic and dizygotic twins, Freire-Maia (1961) concluded that the preference in the type of <b>hand</b> <b>clasping</b> was affected by certain genetic factors, and (perhaps) to a significant extent.|$|R
500|$|Goya's {{series of}} {{aquatint}} etchings The Disasters of War (...) was not completed until 1820, {{although most of}} the prints were made in the period 18101814. [...] The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as I saw this, which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. [...] (One cannot look at this) is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his <b>hands</b> <b>clasped</b> in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>clasping</b> is the {{superposition}} of each {{finger of}} one hand over the corresponding finger of the opposite <b>hand.</b> When <b>clasping</b> the <b>hands,</b> a person tends to interlace the fingers {{in one of two}} ways.
