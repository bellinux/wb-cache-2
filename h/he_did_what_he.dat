5|$|Costa {{was chosen}} as Down Beat jazz critics' new star on piano and vibes for 1957; {{this was the first}} time that one artist had won two {{categories}} in the same year. In 1962 he was invited to play at the first International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C. by the President's Music Committee of the People to People program. An indication of the esteem in which Costa was held by musicians is the caliber of those who performed at his memorial concert at The Village Gate on October 8, 1962: Cohn, Benny Golson, Zoot Sims, Charlie Byrd, Jim Hall, Mundell Lowe, Farmer, Clark Terry and Hawkins were among those who played. The playing of the bands led by the last two was recorded and released as an LP. Hawkins did not usually play at benefit concerts, but his feelings for Costa meant that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to make the seven-hour event a success.|$|E

He ordered that supplies of maize and wheat be kept in the public granaries to protect against future famines, and he ordered the storing of quantities of other provisions as well. He ordered that the Philippines ship mercury to New Spain, {{for use in the}} silver mines. Many mines had been closed for lack of mercury to extract the silver. He legalized the consumption of the mildly alcoholic drink pulque by the natives.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{likely would}} have {{approached}} or exceeded Babe Ruth's home run record {{if he had not}} served in the military, and might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was his patriotic duty.|$|E

25|$|Plagge, as a German, felt {{responsible}} {{for some of}} the horrors he witnessed and felt compelled to work against the genocidal machine. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to help some of Vilniusâ€™ beleaguered Jews by giving work certificates to Jewish men, certifying them as essential and skilled workers regardless of their actual backgrounds. This kind of work permit protected the worker, his wife and two of his children from the SS sweeps carried out in the Vilna Ghetto in which Jews without work papers were captured and killed at the nearby Paneriai (Ponary) execution grounds. Plagge issued 250 of these life-saving permits to men, many of them without mechanical skills, thus protecting over 1,000 Jewish men, women and children from execution from 1941 to mid-1944.|$|E
25|$|Scholars remain {{divided on}} whether Jefferson truly {{condemned}} slavery {{and how he}} changed. Francis D. Cogliano traces the development of competing emancipationist then revisionist and finally contextualist interpretations from the 1960s to the present. The emancipationist view, held by the various scholars at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Douglas L. Wilson, and others maintains Jefferson was an opponent of slavery all his life, noting that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could within the limited range of options available to him to undermine it, his many attempts at abolition legislation, {{the manner in which}} he provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment. The revisionist view, advanced by Paul Finkelman and others criticizes Jefferson for racism, for holding slaves, and for acting contrary to his words, as Jefferson never freed most of his slaves, and he remained silent on the issue while he was President. Contextualists such as Joseph J. Ellis emphasize a change in Jefferson's thinking from emancipationist before 1783, noting a shift toward public passivity and procrastination on policy issues related to slavery. Jefferson seemed to yield to public opinion by 1794 as he laid the groundwork for his first presidential campaign against Adams in 1796.|$|E

Wigler summated: [...] "Jon Bernthal and Jeffrey DeMunn are very likely the finest actors on The Walking Dead, and their {{increasingly}} tense interactions {{have been a}} highlight in recent episodes.

[...] The novel was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy Hearings that prompted him to write the story.|$|E

500|$|Pound's {{education}} {{began in}} a series of dame schools, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote. His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the Jenkintown Times-Chronicle ("by E. L. Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years"), a limerick about William Jennings Bryan, who had just lost the 1896 presidential election: [...] "There was a young man from the West, / <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers will tell you the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{publicly}} {{taking no}} position, Howe privately supported former External Affairs Minister Pearson for the Liberal leadership, and Pearson won the contest in January 1958. Howe advised Pearson {{not to take}} any action that might provoke an election. Pearson did not heed Howe and challenged Diefenbaker as soon as Parliament met. The election on 31 March returned the Progressive Conservatives in a record landslide, which left the Liberals with 48seats. Howe, who took no part in the campaign, had already left for Europe with his wife, Alice, on an extended holiday. [...] On his return, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to help rebuild the Liberal Party after the disaster, assisting with fundraising and seeking to unite factions within the party.|$|E

It seems like somebody up there doesn't like me." [...] The teamsheets showed Gallas partnering Marcel Desailly in central defence, and Hasselbaink starting up front for Chelsea. Wright was named on the bench for Arsenal and Ray Parlour was positioned alongside Vieira in central midfield. Both teams lined up in a 4â€“4â€“2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards.|$|E

Poppy wants Darren to own up straight away, because {{she feels that}} if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well".

He added that while his character was also interested in Jodie, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was expected of him in asking Poppy out. After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony was heading for trouble, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÃ‰, [...] " [...] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy may have something to say to Jodie when she finds out they have kissed". The Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly and the Daily Star Susan Hill confirmed that Poppy would forgive Jodie, and they made their final appearance on 14 November 2011. According to an EastEnders spokesperson, there was potential for Poppy to return in the future; in an interview with Inside Soap, EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "We may see Poppy pop up as I'm a big fan of Rachel Bright and the character, but Kylie is keen to pursue other roles".|$|E

[...] The pair demand that he open his trunk. [...] Inside are many CDsâ€”the man proclaims his love of musicâ€”and a checker board. [...] To pass the time, the mysterious man engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers. [...] They play several rounds. [...] Reyes eventually realizes that the checkers' colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and herself (a brunette); The pair realize that the last victim, the numerologist (victim number 7) was a blonde, and that the murderer has been following a pattern of killing a blonde, then a redhead, then a brunette. [...] Thus, a redhead and a brunette are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. [...] Scully and Reyes also realize that, although they assumed that the car that exited the garage was the killer, it was possible that the killer might still be inside the garage with them.
