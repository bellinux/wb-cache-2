40|$|There is {{abundant}} educational research indicating that <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> (knowledge maps, concept maps, or mind maps) have a beneficial impact on learning, but hardly any research has examined {{this in the}} context of presentations. This study therefore investigated how <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> – as delivered via presentation software – affect learning outcomes and mediating variables such as self-efficacy, cognitive load and appreciation of the learning material. An experiment was set up during a university course (n = 155). E-lectures were designed that shared recorded audio, but differed {{in the design of the}} learning material (<b>graphic</b> <b>organisers),</b> considering the presentation software being used. In both research conditions presentation design was in line with the principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. The results revealed no statistically relevant difference in cognitive load, self-efficacy and knowledge gain, but participants preferred the e-lecture with the <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> to the control version...|$|E
40|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} set of slides, the visual aids of a presentation can now be <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> (concept maps, knowledge maps, mind maps) on an infinite canvas. Constructing <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> has a beneficial impact on learning, but this topic has not been studied {{in the context of}} giving a presentation. The present study examined this issue by having 199 students prepare a presentation. The control sample created visual aids that are similar to a deck of slides with text and pictures. In the first experimental condition, <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> were inserted in this deck of slides, and in the second experimental condition, visuals aids with interconnected <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> were produced. There {{were no significant differences in}} self-reported self-efficacy related to giving a presentation and in motivational variables. To detect if the presentations met the principles set by the conditions, the participants’ products were coded qualitatively, but this analysis also yielded no differences in variables. Further research should therefore explore the interaction between software and presenter...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world of}} {{constant}} and rapid change there are greater demands placed on learners to not only gain content knowledge, but also to develop learning skills and to adopt new strategies that {{will enable them to}} produce better and faster learning outcomes. Especially in internationally advancing nations like Kuwait this will be a major challenge of the future. This literature review examines theoretical frameworks that enhance Kuwaiti teachers’ knowledge and skill to adopt culturally relevant reform practices across a number of disciplines and provide guidance in an exploration and use of newer pedagogical tools like <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers.</b> It analyses the effects of <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> on higher order learning and evaluates how they can effect professional development and pedagogical change in Kuwait...|$|E

40|$|Though {{the ability}} to think is one of the {{numerous}} roles of the human brain (Parry and Gregory, 1998), many learner readers in Nigeria lack the required skills for creative and critical thinking necessary for interpretation during and after reading sessions.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{limited amount}} of {{research}} has been done to investigate critical thinking abilities of students {{from the point of view}} of inquiry-based learning approach. In view of the objectives of the present educational system to develop the quality of manpower for it to enter the new knowledge era, a better understanding of the resourcefulness of Malaysian students and factors which could affect or enhance it becomes more crucial. The influence of personal variables such as critical thinking skills and styles, gender, academic achievements and the possibility of integrating interactive multimedia technology into the teaching of thinking skills would be of concern to the educator and the policy-makers. For the above reasons, the author decides to conduct a comprehensive research designed to measure the current status level of critical thinking capabilities of Malaysian students and develop a multimedia courseware package, written in the Malay language, incorporating apprenticeship learning design, with content focusing on verbal maps, <b>graphic</b> <b>organiser</b> and CoRT 1 techniques that are capable of enhancing studentsâ€™ capability in critical thinking via inquiry-based learning approach.

He developed the concept as a cognitive instructional strategy to promote the learning of new information—to bridge and link old information with new. In the mid 1990 s, Tony Buzan was a major player in developing the practice of using a particular type of graphic organiser, the mind map, to assist learning. He believes that “a mind map is the easiest way to put information into your brain and to take information out of your brain ” (2002, p. 6).

40|$|In the master's thesis I outline {{some of the}} {{important}} aspects of learning with understanding: understanding a mathematical concept, assessing understanding, the image and the definition of mathematical concepts, graphic organiser {{as a tool for}} facilitating understanding mathematical concepts. In particular I focus on the theory of Tall an Vinner on concept image, its structure, consistency, and the discrepancy between the concept definition and the concept image, i. e. the cognitive processes used to understand them. In the thesis I also consider graphic organiser as a tool for improving understanding concepts, the usage of graphic organiser, including its usage in solving problems, and the reasons for appropriateness of its introduction into mathematics classes in Slovenia. In the empirical part of the master's thesis I present a pilot research establishing whether the use of graphic organiser in teaching improves pupils' understanding of direct proportionality. In particular I consider whether pupils that use graphing organiser exhibit a better concept image of direct proportionality with respect to those that do not use it. Furthermore I analysed five <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> on the topic of direct proportionality from a random sample of pupils. ...|$|E
40|$|For any living {{organism}} to function efficiently and survive, proper coordination {{of the various}} systems is indeed necessary. Thus, {{in the study of}} Biology, the ability to build interrelationships among concepts and related topics, and to relate newly acquired knowledge to prior knowledge, is crucial to the understanding of biological concepts and how the systems work together to bring about a coordinated response. Concept maps, diagrams and other <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> are useful tools to illustrate the links between concepts and topics. In this paper, a classroom lesson which first teaches a particular topic in Biology, sickle-cell anaemia, followed by an activity which links it to the topics of mutation, meiosis, inheritance, circulatory system and evolution by natural selection, {{with the aid of a}} concept map, is discussed. Students work in groups of two or three to construct concept maps on each topic before linking all the concept maps together into one. This encourages cooperative learning. Besides concept maps, annotated diagrams could be used. When students are able to discover the links between concepts themselves, they move away from rote or surface learning, and replace it with deep and meaningful learning, thus increasing the level of understanding and appreciation for the subject. ...|$|E
40|$|Teaching {{thinking}} skills will best {{prepare students for}} the complex problems that await them in the future. Learning tasks now require students to demonstrate deeper understanding {{through the application of}} knowledge to solve problems. The shift towards the development of student {{thinking skills}} is {{based on the premise that}} the collection of knowledge alone is not sufficient for young people to function in a complex world. Despite the emphasis placed on the development of student thinking skills, there has been little discernible change in the way some classrooms operate. One model that provides a practical framework for teachers to infuse instruction in thinking skills into curriculum content is the Dimensions of Learning model. Underpinning this model is the assumption that all learning is thinking and that if learning is to be enhanced teachers must explicitly teach the thinking skills needed. Dimensions of Learning was developed as a model that translated educational research into a comprehensive set of instructional strategies based around five types of thinking. Central to the Dimensions of Learning framework is a five-step process that guides teachers through the explicit teaching of thinking skills: (1) Help students understand the process. (2) Give students a model for the process and create opportunities for students to practise using the process. (3) Focus on the critical steps and difficult aspects of the process. (4) Provide students with <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> of the thinking process. (5) Use teacher-structured and student-structured tasks. [Author abstract, ed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mathematics vocabulary development of Grade 5 students by designing vocabulary instructions, utilising Graphic Organizers (GOs) as an instructional tool. In order to achieve this objective, an exploratory action research was conducted within the qualitative paradigm in a private school in Karachi, Pakistan. The data collection tools {{used in the study}} were: a semi-structured interview with the mathematics teacher, pre and post-teaching task-based interviews with the participating students, classroom observations, analysing students’ work sample, and reflective journal maintained by the researcher. The study was conducted in three action research cycles in which I (researcher) taught eight vocabulary lessons based on the first three basic operations on numbers. Finding one showed that the designed mathematics vocabulary instructions changed learners’ problem solving behaviour. Initially, they would merely carry out an arithmetic operation apparently related to key words in the text. However, they gradually started to first, comprehend technical, sub-technical and generic vocabulary stated in the problems; then decided which arithmetic operation would be appropriate in the given situation. Finding two indicated that the use of <b>Graphic</b> <b>Organisers</b> during the vocabulary lessons facilitated the students to enrich their vocabulary knowledge. Finding three revealed that with the improved mathematics language and literacy skills, the students enhanced their conceptual understanding of basic operations on numbers and their multiple representations. This study can help mathematics teachers and educators to design explicit vocabulary instructions as part of their routine teaching and to facilitate learners in acquiring mathematics literacy skills and internalising the language of mathematical problems. Also, the GOs adopted and constructed during the intervention of the study can be used and experimented by teachers, educators and researchers for further studies...|$|E
40|$|Educational reforms {{currently}} being enacted in Kuwaiti Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) {{in response to}} contemporary demands for increased student-centred teaching and learning are challenging for FCS teachers due to their limited experience with student-centred learning tools such as <b>Graphic</b> <b>Organisers</b> (GOs). To adopt these reforms, Kuwaiti teachers require {{a better understanding of}} and competency in promoting cognitive learning processes that will maximise student-centred learning approaches. This study followed the experiences of four Grade 6 FCS Kuwaiti teachers as they undertook a Professional Development (PD) program specifically designed to advance their understanding of the use of GOs and then as they implemented what they had learned in their Grade 6 FCS classroom. The PD program developed for this study was informed by Nasseh. s competency PD model as well as Piaget and Ausubel. s cognitive theories. This model enabled an assessment and evaluation of the development of the teachers. competencies as an outcome of the PD program in terms of the adoption of GOs, in particular, and their capacity to use GOs to engage students in personalised, in-depth, learning through critical thinking and understanding. The research revealed that the PD program was influential in reforming the teachers. learning, understanding of and competency in, cognitive and visual theories of learning, so that they facilitated student-centred teaching and learning processes that enabled students to adopt and adapt GOs in constructivist learning. The implementation of five GOs - Flow Chart, Concept Maps, K-W-L Chart, Fishbone Diagram and Venn Diagram - as learning tools in classrooms was investigated to find if changes in pedagogical approach for supporting conceptual learning through cognitive information processing would reduce the cognitive work load of students and produce better learning approaches. The study as evidenced by the participant teachers. responses and classroom observations, showed a marked increase in student interest, participation, critical thought, problem solving skills, as a result of using GOs, compared to using traditional teaching and learning methods. A theoretical model was developed from the study {{based on the premise that}} teachers. knowledge of the subject, pedagogy and student learning precede the implementation of student-centred learning reform, that it plays an important role in the implementation of student-centred learning and that it brings about a change in teaching practice. The model affirmed that observed change in teaching-practice included aspects of teachers. beliefs, as well as confidence and effect on workplace and on student learning, including engagement, understanding, critical thinking and problem solving. The model assumed that change in teaching practice is inseparable from teachers. lifelong PD needs related to knowledge, understanding, skills and competency. These findings produced a set of preliminary guidelines for establishing student-centred constructivist strategies in Kuwaiti education while retaining Kuwait. s cultural uniqueness...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a qualitative, ethnographic study, which {{examines}} {{the assumption that}} {{at the heart of}} worthwhile teaching and learning is our shared humanity. Artefacts, stories and photographs are explored as vehicles through which learners critically examine and share their cultural learning and perceptions of what is significant and valuable. In this way artefacts, stories and photographs provide a conduit for learning between and among people of diverse cultures. I believe such learning celebrates our shared humanity, which is deliberately defined in positive terms as "the best that encompasses the collective quality and characteristics of all people including kindness, compassion, empathy, humility, caring and thoughtfulness" Learning that celebrates our humanity may be considered a positive force and humanitarian in nature. In the context of this thesis I speak of and describe humanitarian learning as "the development of understanding of self and others through the sharing of personal, cultural and social experiences that exemplify the attitudes and values needed for responsible citizenship and dignified relationships. Rich sources of ideas, expertise and perceptions about relevant experience have been drawn from various authors and educators. Key documentation from the International Baccalaureate Organisation, (IBO), including "A Continuum of International Education"(2002) and the work of the former Director General of the IBO. Professor George Walker also provided useful resource material. The data was generated through questionnaires and photographs focussing on cultural artefacts with personal meaning, documenting the voices, reflections, interactions, and perceptions of the participants about the significance of cultural diversity in their lives and education. The data is presented in a series of charts and <b>graphic</b> <b>organisers</b> linked with the IBO expected teaching practices. These are analysed in the context of intercultural understanding and humanitarian learning, a notion developed and examined in this thesis with a view to how it may be supported. In analysing the data, the following key points emerged. • Personal multicultural experiences, a sense of global awareness and a thorough appreciation of people from differing backgrounds are considered highly significant in humanitarian learning • Stories, artefacts and photographs create an accessible, versatile and effective human connecting instrument enabling humanitarian learning • Stories, artefacts and photographs can illuminate cultural conflict, tension and misunderstanding. Suggestions and recommendations for ways that humanitarian learning can be fostered in a climate defined by tolerance, respect and responsibility include: • The need to make more explicit the obligations of learners to develop perspectives, intuition and empathy so they know themselves and others and are able to view cultural difference as enriching • The notion of learning as humanitarian is worthy of greater emphasis and implementation in educational organisations • The recognition that areas of tension between people have great potential for meaningful growth of understanding across cultures. This thesis provides a springboard for more serious consideration and action towards initiating learning that purposefully fosters people knowing each other in a spirit of global responsibility...|$|E
