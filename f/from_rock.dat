5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz with European classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations {{on the album}} with rhythms and melodies <b>from</b> <b>rock,</b> R, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977).

This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

5|$|Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User {{created the}} musical score for Phantasmagoria, with Neal Grandstaf {{providing}} additional music. Most {{of the music}} {{is a mixture of}} real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer. Themes for the music ranged <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> and roll to opera. The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating stingers as needed. For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry.|$|E
5|$|The album sold 75,000 {{copies in}} its first week of release and debuted at number 10 on Billboard 200. Four months after its release, the record was {{certificated}} gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping half million copies in the US, of which 383,000 were sold according to Nielsen Soundscan. Two years after its original release, the album sold 850,000 copies in the United States and won widespread praise <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> radio programmers. However, Cryptic Writings did not enjoy particular chart success on international level. It only managed to peak at number two on the Finnish Albums Chart, where it charted for eleven weeks. Elsewhere, it didn't enter into the top 10. It eventually received a gold certification from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 50,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|While {{it may be}} {{uncertain}} when cultivation began it {{is still}} {{considered one of the}} oldest domesticated crops. Remains of charred cowpeas <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> shelters in Central Ghana have been dated to the second millennium BCE. In 2300 BC the cowpea is believed to have made its way into South East Asia where secondary domestication events may have occurred. From there they traveled north to the Mediterranean, where they were used by the Greeks and Romans. The first written references to the cowpea were in 300 BC and they probably reached Central and North America during the slave trade through the 17th to early 19th centuries.|$|E

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those <b>from</b> <b>Rock</b> Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Crass {{have said}} that their musical {{influences}} were seldom drawn <b>from</b> <b>rock,</b> but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor enters Bennett's room, {{and finds}} {{things are not}} as they seem. The {{supposedly}} crippled Bennett is missing, and a tape recorder hides his absence. He finds a trap door in {{the floor of the}} cabin and follows it to a temple carved <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.|$|E
