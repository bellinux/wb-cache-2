5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and <b>grappling</b> attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to different strategies depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and <b>grappling</b> attacks. Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E

40|$|The {{grabbing}} {{forces of}} log <b>grapples</b> were modeled and analyzed mathematically under operating conditions when grabbing logs from compact log piles and from bunch-like log piles. The grabbing forces {{are closely related}} to the structural parameters of the <b>grapple,</b> the weight of the <b>grapple,</b> and the weight of the log grabbed. An opera-tional model <b>grapple</b> was designed and tested to validate grabbing forces of the mathematical models while grab-bing logs from five alternative diameter classes under two different working conditions. The working conditions and log sizes affected the grabbing forces significantly. Vali-dation results suggest that the mathematical models de-veloped can be used to estimate the grabbing forces re-quired in the design process of log <b>grapples.</b> The results can be used by equipment manufacturers and researchers involved in the engineering design of <b>grapples</b> used in harvesting operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{gripping}} arms of today’s <b>grapples</b> {{follow a}} circular motion {{which means that}} the <b>grapple</b> must be lowered or heightened continuously by the operator to avoid that the timber is missed or that damage of the ground surface occurs. Because of this LIAB (Lima Innovation AB) wants to examine the possibilities to construct a new <b>grapple</b> that solves this problem. The goal of this thesis work is to construct a <b>grapple,</b> which fits existing forwarders, that minimizes the digging motion. Throughout the project a product development process, elaborated at Luleå University of Technology, called Sirius Masterplan has been followed. The use of, among other things, motion- and FEM-analysis has resulted in solid models of a <b>grapple</b> that, with the aid of four bar linkages, performs a close to linear motion along the ground.

50|$|To {{ensure that}} cable is laid and {{retrieved}} properly, specially designed equipment must be used. Different equipment {{is used on}} cable-laying ships depending on what their job requires. In order to retrieve damaged or mislaid cable, a <b>grapple</b> system is used to gather cable from the ocean floor. There are several types of <b>grapples,</b> each with certain advantages or disadvantages. These <b>grapples</b> {{are attached to the}} vessel via a <b>grapple</b> rope, originally a mix of steel and manila lines, but now made from synthetic materials. This ensures that the line is strong, yet can flex and strain {{under the weight of the}} <b>grapple.</b> The line is pulled up by reversing the Liner Cable Engine used to lay the cable.|$|R
