Aim: To report the results of laparoscopic <b>esophagomyotomy</b> in patients with achalasia. Patients and methods: Nineteen patients with achalasia, nine women, aged 9 to 66 years old, operated between 1996 and 2001 are reported. Results: There was no surgical mortality. One patient had a subphrenic abscess due to an unnoticed tear of the esophageal mucosa. During surgery, esophageal mucosa was perforated in 4 patients, that was sutured in three. One patient with an extensive tear of the mucosa required conversion to classical surgery. Patients were followed for 2 to 48 months.

40|$|AbstractThe {{role of an}} antireflux {{procedure}} as {{an adjunct}} to <b>esophagomyotomy</b> for achalasia remains a subject of controversy. Little objective documentation exists of this operation's effect on sphincteric competence and the degree of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux. This report of esophageal manometry and 24 -hour pH monitoring on 14 patients with esophageal achalasia whom we had previously treated by a short <b>esophagomyotomy</b> without an antireflux procedure provides such documentation. <b>Esophagomyotomy</b> reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure by 12 % to 71 % (mean 41 %) from a preoperative mean of 26. 7 mm Hg to a postoperative mean of 14. 6 mm Hg. The number of postoperative episodes of acid reflux per patient in 24 hours was fewer than 29 (normal < 49) in 13 patients, with a median of 12 episodes for the entire group. Esophageal acid exposure, measured as percentage of total time with pH less than 4. 0 (normal < 4. 5 %), was below 4. 5 % in 10 patients, six of whom had values less than 1 %. Among the four patients with values greater than 4. 5 %, only one had a temporal correlation of symptoms with an episode of acid reflux. Multivariate analysis showed that esophageal acid exposure time correlated only with the level of residual lower esophageal sphincter pressure during the relaxation phase of deglutition. A pressure less than 8 mm Hg was predictive of normal acid contact time (p < 0. 001). Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure, percent reduction in lower esophageal sphincter amplitude, postoperative vector volume, and length of the lower esophageal sphincter did not significantly correlate with amount of esophageal acid exposure. We conclude that a short <b>esophagomyotomy</b> without an antireflux procedure results in a competent lower esophageal sphincter in most patients. Increased esophageal acid exposure, when it occurs, is due to slow clearance of esophageal acid from relatively few reflux episodes and is more likely to occur when there is a high residual pressure during deglutition after myotomy. These findings suggest that the addition of an antireflux procedure to a short <b>esophagomyotomy</b> would not be expected to improve clinical results.

40|$|Background: {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} is to compare the wound healing of the laparoscopic <b>esophagomyotomy</b> with and without a gastric patch. Methods: Twelve male pigs were distributed into two groups of six animals. <b>Esophagomyotomy</b> was performed in group A. A gastric patch was associated to the myotomy in group B. On the 21 (st) stop postoperative day, lumen molding was accomplished to determine the index of stenosis (IS) at the area of myotomy (AM). Macroscopic and microscopic aspects of wound healing were also studied at AM. Three microscopic morphologic patterns were defined for morphometric evaluation: leukocytes (constituted by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells), new endothelial cells, and collagen fibers. Results: There was a longer operative duration in group B (93. 6 min) than in group A (45 min). At AM, IS was negative (lumen increased) and equivalent in both groups: - 11. 1 % in group A and - 12. 7 % in group B. Mesotelial epithelium covering RM was observed in group A. Inflammatory reaction was greater in group B in comparison with group A (leuCocytes: 22 cells versus 8. 6; fibrosis: 25. 5 fibers versus 15. 6; granulation tissue: 18. 7 vessels versus 9. 7). Conclusions: <b>Esophagomyotomy</b> followed by gastric patch does not heal adequately and is worsened by the presence of foreign body granulomas around stitches. Myotomy without gastric patch is faster and causes lower inflammation. Myotomy alone or with gastric patch does not lead to esophageal stenosis at RM and does not lead to restoration of the esophageal musculature continuity.

40|$|Background: Albeit rare in children, {{achalasia}} is {{a disorder}} with severe symptoms that causes growth impairment. The {{treatment of choice}} in children is the <b>esophagomyotomy,</b> although there are variations in the surgical approaches available and differences of opinion regarding the inclusion of an adjunctive antireflux procedure. The recent advent of the laparoscopic approach has {{had a profound impact}} on the treatment of achalasia in both adults and children. Methods: In this report, we describe eight patients with severe achalasia who were treated by laparoscopic Heller’s operation associated with a fundoplication according to either Dor’s or Toupet’s technique. The patients’ ages ranged between 2 and 13 years. A five-port technique was used: a 10 -mm port placed infraumbilically for the optics and four 5 -mm ports. One was placed in the right abdominal quadrant for retraction of the left hepatic lobe, one in the left abdominal quadrant for the first operative instrument, one below the xyphoid appendix for the second operative instrument, and the last one to introduce a 5 -mm cannula laterally to the umbilicus to retract the stomach below. A 7 – 8 -cm laparoscopic Heller <b>esophagomyotomy</b> was completed, followed by an anterior Dor fundoplication in six cases and a Toupet in two. The longitudinal division of the anterior esophageal musculature was performed with a scalpel or scissors. The myotomy was made along the stomach, extending for 2 – 3 cm. Results: Mean operating time was 120 mins. Three complications were recorded. There were two perforations of the gastroesophageal mucosa; the first was sutured in laparoscopy and the second required a second operation. The third complication was a case of dysphagia resolved by dismounting a fundoplication that was too tight. At follow-up, which lasted from 6 months to 5 years, the children were all free of symptoms. Conclusions: Laparoscopic Heller <b>esophagomyotomy</b> appears to be a complex and difficult operation, but it is as safe and effective as laparotomy in children with achalasia. However, complications can be numerous and severe at the beginning of a surgeon’s experience...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic <b>esophagomyotomy</b> is the {{preferred}} approach to patients with achalasia of the esophagus, However, {{there are very few}} long-term follow-up studies (> 10 years) in these patients. Objective: To perform a very late subjective and objective follow-up in a group of 67 patients submitted to <b>esophagomyotomy</b> plus a partial antireflux surgery (Dor's technique). Material and Methods: In a prospective study that lasted 30 years, 67 patients submitted to surgery were divided into 3 groups: group I followed for 80 to 119 months (15 patients); group 11, with follow-up of 120 to 239 months (35 patients); and group 111, with follow-up more than 240 months (17 patients). They were submitted to clinical questionnaire, endoscopic evaluation, histologic analysis, radiologic studies, manometric determinations, and 24 -hour pH studies late after surgery. Results: Three patients developed a squamous cell esophageal carcinoma 5, 7, and 15 years after surgery. At the late follow-up, Visick III and IV were seen in 7 %, 23 %, and 35 %, according to the length of follow-up of each group. Endoscopic examination revealed a progressive nonsignificant deterioration of esophageal mucosa, histologic analysis distal to squamous-columnar junction showed a significant decrease of fundic mucosa in patients of group 111, with increase of intestinal metaplasia, although not significant time. Lower esophageal sphincter showed a significant decrease of resting pressure I year after surgery, which remained similar at the late control. There was no return to peristaltic activity. Acid reflux measured by 24 -hour pH studies revealed a progressive increase, and the follow-up was longer. Nine patients developed Barrett esophagus: 6 of them a short-segment and 3 a long-segment Barrett esophagus. Final clinical results in all 67 patients demonstrated excellent or good results in 73 % of the cases, development of epidermoid carcinoma in 4. 5 %, and failures in 22. 4 % of the patients, mainly due to reflux esophagitis. Incomplete myotomy was seen in only I case. Conclusion: In patients with achalasia submitted to <b>esophagomyotomy</b> and Dor's antireflux procedure, there is a progressive clinical deterioration of initially good results if a very long follow-up is performed (23 years after surgery), mainly due to an increase in pathologic, acid reflux disease and the development of short- or long-segment Barrett esophagus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBetween 1976 and 1993, 22 {{patients}} with intrathoracic esophageal perforations, none associated with carcinoma, underwent primary repair {{regardless of the}} interval between perforation {{and the time of}} repair. Eighteen perforations were iatrogenic and four were spontaneous. The interval from perforation to operation was less than 12 hours in 10 patients, 12 to 24 hours in 3, and more than 24 hours in 9. Principles of repair included (1) a local <b>esophagomyotomy</b> proximal and distal to the tear to expose the mucosal defect and normal mucosa beyond, (2) debridement of the mucosal defect and closure over a bougie, and (3) reapproximation of the muscle. The repair was buttressed with muscle or pleura in five patients. Associated distal obstruction caused by reflux stricture was treated with dilation and fundoplication in four patients. Of the four {{patients with}} achalasia, two underwent <b>esophagomyotomy</b> with a fundoplication and one underwent myotomy alone. There was one death. The esophageal repair healed primarily in 17 patients (80 %). Four patients, three of whom underwent repair more than 24 hours after the perforation, had leaks at the site of repair. All four fistulas eventually healed with drainage alone, two with simple tube thoracostomy and two with rib resection and empyema tube placement. In the absence of cancer or an irreversible distal obstruction, meticulous repair of an intrathoracic esophageal perforation is the preferred approach, regardless of the duration of the injury, inasmuch as primary healing is likely, and the morbidity associated with prolonged drainage or diversion may be avoided.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{several aspects}} on {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) and associated complications as Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. I. To clarify the natural course of GERD, a pH-metry verified cohort was re-evaluated after 20 years. The course of GERD {{may well be}} progressive. A statement {{based on the evidence}} that reflux induced complications as esophagitis and Barrett’s esophagus increased significantly. II. A myotomised achalasia with an abolished antireflux barrier (upon an aperistaltic esophagus), creates an unrestrained gastroesophageal reflux and can therefore be regarded as an end-stage reflux disease. This clinical trial was to compare the long-term outcome for patients with an end-stage reflux disease (achalasia) who underwent Heller’s <b>esophagomyotomy</b> with or without an additional Nissen fundoplication. Heller’s <b>esophagomyotomy</b> induces advanced reflux. The complications induced by reflux and the need for acid suppressants can successfully be eliminated by an additional antireflux repair. III. Defective mismatch repair (MMR) is the cause of microsatellite instability pathway and specifically associated with the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. MMR expression was evaluated in Barrett’s adenocarcinomas. An association between HNPCC and Barrett’s adenocarcinoma may exist, although probably without clinical significance. IV. Increased understanding of the molecular processes associated with Barrett’s carcinogenesis may be beneficial for early tumor detection, refined diagnosis and for improved prognostication. Immunohistochemical staining was applied for tumor markers in order to evaluate their prognostic importance in Barrett’s adenocarcinomas. Reduced expression of E-cadherin was significantly associated with a more advanced tumor stage and was also shown to independently predict a poor prognosis...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{function of}} the normal and pathologic esophageal body under more physiologic conditions than those utilized for traditional laboratory testing, manometry was performed before and during eating using a catheter assembly containing three peripheral transducers. Studies were evaluated from seven normal volunteers, 18 typical achalasia patients (eight before and 10 after <b>esophagomyotomy),</b> and eight patients with diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) as characterized by frequent simultaneous and repetitive contractions. In the preprandial period, all had similar frequencies of esophageal contractions, {{although there was a}} wide range. During eating, the frequency of contractions increased in all groups; however, the contraction frequency in unoperated achalasia patients, 12. 7 +/- 5. 0 contractions/min, significantly exceeded the frequency in normal volunteers of 4. 9 +/- 1. 3 contractions/min, p less than 0. 01. The frequency was lower in operated achalasia patients, 9. 4 +/- 6. 5 contractions/min, but still exceeded that of normal volunteers, p less than 0. 01. Patients with DES also had more frequent contractions, 10. 5 +/- 9. 7 contractions/min, than did the normal volunteers, p less than 0. 01. The mean pressure of esophageal contractions for both achalasia groups was similar and was significantly lower than for the normal volunteers. Pressure in the DES patients was intermediate. It is concluded that patients with achalasia have lower pressure but more frequent contractions than normal volunteers during eating, and this spasm-like activity may be a more important pathophysiologic factor in their dysphagia than previously recognized. <b>Esophagomyotomy</b> does decrease the frequency of these contractions.

40|$|Objectives: With the {{introduction}} of videoscopic techniques, controversy has arisen whether a thoracoscopic or laproscopic approach is indicated for the surgical management of symptomatic primary motility disorders. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the outcomes of the two techniques performed by one group. Methods: Between 1995 and 1997, 78 patients (42 female, 36 males: ages 21 ± 86; mean 53 years) underwent a videoscopic <b>esophagomyotomy</b> with fundoplication via a thoracic (12) or abdominal (66) approach for dysphagia or chest pain. Pre±operative evaluation with esophagogastroscopy and manometry revealed a primary motility disorder in 64 and primary motility disorder with stricture in 14. Primary motility disorders exhibited were hypertensive LES (25), nutcracker (26), achalasia (14), and diffuse esophageal spasm (13). Associated fundoplications to prevent re¯ux included abdominal Toupet partial fundoplicatio (52), abdominal Nissen (14) and thoracic Belsey (12). Signi®cance of variation in outcomes was determined by Mann±Whitney U-test. Results: There was no mortality. Follow-up ranged from 6 ± 40 months (mean 18). Early morbidity included dyshagia ± chest pain greater than 6 weeks in 16 patients. (5 Belsey 41 %, 10 Toupet 19 %, 1 Nissen 7 %) Late morbidity included three recurrent strictures requiring dilatation (Belsey 2 / 5, Toupet 1 / 7).

Best long term results are obtained if the lower esophageal sphincter pressure can be reduced below 10 mmHg. Major complications are rare after pneumatic dilation; the most serious complication is esophageal perforation, which occurs at a mean rate of about 2. 5 %. Considering {{the pros and cons of}} other effective forms of treatment of achalasia (<b>esophagomyotomy</b> and intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin), pneumatic dilation is still the treatment of choice in the majority of patients with achalasia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Video-assisted {{surgical}} {{approaches to}} esophageal achalasia {{continue to be}} explored by many surgeons involved {{in the management of}} this motor disorder. We report our experience with thoracoscopic and laparoscopic <b>esophagomyotomy</b> to more clearly define the efficacy and safety of these approaches. Patients: Over 73 months, 58 patients with achalasia underwent thoracoscopic myotomy (n = 19) alone or laparoscopic myotomy (n = 39) with partial fundoplication (anterior = 15; posterior = 24). Mean age was 47. 2 years and average length of symptoms was 60 months. Primary symptoms were as follows: dysphagia, 100 %; pulmonary abnormalities, 22 %; weight loss; 47 %, and pain, 45 %. Mean esophageal diameter was 6 cm and tortuosity was present in 16 % (9 / 58) of patients. Prior management consisted of dilation (n = 47), botulinum toxin injection (n = 8), and prior myotomy (n = 1). Methods: In the operating room all patients underwent endoscopic examination and evacuation of retained esophageal contents. The <b>esophagomyotomy</b> was extended 4 cm superiorly and inferiorly to 1 cm beyond the lower esophageal sphincter. Thoracoscopic and laparoscopic procedures were completed in all patients without conversion to an open operation. Mean operative time was 183 minutes (± 58. 1) and hospital stay averaged 2. 3 days (± 0. 8). There was no operative mortality. The 1 operative complication was a perforation that was identified during the operation and repaired thoracoscopically. Results: Symptoms improved in 97 % of patients. Mean dysphagia scores (range 0 - 10) decreased from 9. 8 ± 1. 6 before the operation to 2. 0 ± 1. 5 after the operation (P <. 001) at a mean follow-up of 6 months. Postoperative reflux symptoms developed in 5 % (1 / 19) of the thoracoscopy group and 8 % (4 / 39) of the laparoscopy group. Nine patients have persistent or recurrent dysphagia (16 %). Seven patients have successfully undergone Savary dilation, and 2 required esophagectomy to manage recalcitrant dysphagia. Conclusion: At this intermediate term analysis, video-assisted approaches for management of achalasia are a reasonable alternative to extended medical therapy or open operations.

40|$|During a 15 -year period, 62 {{patients}} were treated for achalasia of the esophagus. Pneumatic dilation (PD) had been performed initially in 46 and {{was successful in}} 23; failures were due to acute perforation of the esophagus, persistent dysphagia, or pathologic gastroesophageal reflux. <b>Esophagomyotomy</b> alone (EM) was performed in 19 individuals resulting in definite improvement in 12; four patients had moderate reflux or dysphagia, and three of these required another surgical procedure. An extended myotomy with an antireflux procedure (M-NF) was performed in 13 patients with symptomatic relief in 12; one patient required reconstruction of a too-tight fundoplication that caused persistent dysphagia. The advantages of pneumatic dilation were the ease of performance, patient acceptability, and an overall efficacy of 50 %. Definitive surgical therapy, while more predictably effective in relieving dysphagia, was considerably more expensive in terms of patient discomfort and time. When pathologic reflux was present following a previous procedure, the M-NF was performed; obstruction of the esophagus did not occur if the fundoplication was "floppy.

40|$|Video−assisted {{thoracic}} surgery (VATS) {{is a major}} revolution in {{thoracic surgery}}. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia with double lumen endotracheal intubation for separate control of each lung. Operative ports should be placed carefully, avoiding damage to the intercostal vessels and nerves. The video technique can be used efficiently for the following indications: pneumothorax, resection of pulmonary nodules, biopsies of lung, pleura and mediastinal structures, resection of mediastinal tumors, management of empyema, and hemostasis and suture of lacerations after trauma. Indications for esophageal procedures include <b>esophagomyotomy,</b> fundoplication, and resection of benign lesions. Repair of esophageal perforation can be done at an early stage. Major resections of pul− monary and esophageal cancer are a matter of controversy. The apparent advantage of diminished pain is offset by spread of malignant cells and potential damage to the resected specimen with loss of important information con− cerning pathology. Complications of VATS are few and include prolonged air leak, dysrhythmia, respiratory fail− ure and bleeding. VATS has become an inseparable part of thoracic surgery and {{should be included in}} the basic training of every thoracic surgeon (Adv Clin Exp Med 2007, 16, 4, 473 – 477).

40|$|Abstract: Several {{theories}} on the etiology and pathophysiology of achalasia {{have been reported}} but, to date, it is widely accepted that loss of peristalsis and absence of swallow-induced relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter are the main functional abnormalities. Treatment of achalasia often aims to alleviate the symptoms of achalasia and not to correct the underlying disorder. Medical therapy has poor efficacy, so patients who are good surgical candidates should be offered either laparoscopic myotomy or pneumatic balloon dilatation.

Laparoscopic surgical <b>esophagomyotomy</b> is a safe and effective modality.

Pneumatic dilatation has proven to be a safe, effective, and durable modality of treatment when performed by experienced individuals, and appears to be the most cost-effective alternative.

40|$|Describe the {{clinical}} and imaging findings of rare symptomatic giant Killian-Jamieson diverticulum (KJD) detected in a 97 year old female patient and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to be implemented. Methods. The clinical history began implementing anamnesis and physical examination, followed by laryngoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, sonographic examination and subsequently a double-contrast pharyngoesophagram evaluations, to our symptomatic old patient with results of typically KJD, with maximal dimension of 5 cm. The KJD was successfully {{treated with a}} surgical approach, <b>esophagomyotomy</b> {{in addition to a}} diverticulopexy; these techniques were used for adequate visualization of the tissue bridge of the diverticulum and protection of the surrounding tissue during dissection of the tissue bridge. Results. Our patient has benefit from the operation immediately, with resolution of the disease. The follow-up (on-going), up to now, showed no recurrence of the pathological and no complications, making sure the authors of the efficacy of the surgical treatment. Conclusion. The Authors note that believe in the surgical treatment as the only procedure to the cure of the patients and, to date, our successful experience suggests that only surgical approach can be a safe and effective method for the treatment of symptomatic giant KJD, due to its close proximity to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the concern of possible nerve injury...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Achalasia of the {{esophagus}} {{is characterized by}} aperistalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in response to swallowing. The objective {{of the present study}} is to present the experience of a modified Heller myotomy via a laparoscopic approach for the treatment of children who had this condition. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of all patients who underwent this procedure from 2000 to 2009 was performed. The procedure consisted of an extended <b>esophagomyotomy</b> beginning on {{the lower part of the}} lower esophageal sphincter and continuing 5 to 6 cm above on the lower third of {{the esophagus}}, and then extended 3 to 4 cm below to the stomach, associated with an anterior 180 -degree hemi-fundoplication according to Dor`s technique. Results: Fifteen patients were included in the study. There were 8 female and 7 male patients. Mean operating time was 190 minutes with no intraoperative complications and 1 conversion to open surgery because of difficulty in dissecting an inflamed distal esophagus. In a mean follow-up period of 32. 3 months, 2 patients had recurrence of mild dysphagia that disappeared spontaneously, and 1 required a single botulinum toxin injection with complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusion: We conclude that the laparoscopic extended Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication is a safe and effective method for the treatment for achalasia in the pediatric population even in advanced cases.

40|$|Background: This report {{describes}} three Italian centers’ {{experience in}} the treatment of children with esophageal achalasia. Patients and Methods: Between June 2000 and June 2012, 31 children (13 girls and 18 boys, with a median age of 8. 4 years) affected by esophageal achalasia were treated in three different institutions with an <b>esophagomyotomy</b> according to Heller’s procedure via laparoscopy associated with a Dor antireflux procedure. Between 2000 and 2005 (for 14 patients) we used mono- or bipolar coagulation to perform myotomy; after 2005 (for 17 patients) we used the new hemostatic devices to perform it. Results: Median length of surgery was 120 minutes. Median hospital stay was 4 days. We recorded eight complications in our series: 3 patients (9. 6 %) had a mucosal perforation, and 5 children (16. 1 %) presented dysphagia after surgery. When comparing the data before and after 2005, it seems that the new hemostatic devices statistically shortened the length of surgery (P <. 01, Student’s t test). Conclusions: On the basis of our experience, laparoscopic Heller’s myotomy associated with an antireflux procedure is a safe and effective method for the treatment of achalasia in the pediatric population. Intraoperative complications were < 10 %, and they occurred mostly at the beginning of our experience. Residual dysphagia occurred in about 16 % of cases. The use of the new hemostatic devices seems to reduce the length of surgery and intraoperative bleeding. Considering the rarity of this pathology, we believe that patients with achalasia have to be treated only at centers with a strong {{experience in the}} treatment of this pathology...|$|E

40|$|From 1976 to 1989, 206 {{patients}} {{referred for}} primary treatment of esophageal achalasia underwent transabdominal Heller's myotomy and anterior fundoplication {{according to the}} Dor technique. In {{the majority of the}} patients, the cardia was not mobilized, and the myotomy was extended in length for about 10 cm (8 cm on the esophagus and 2 cm on the stomach). There was no operative mortality. Two patients (0. 9 %) required reoperation due to bleeding from the myotomy site in one and leakage from the gastrotomy site in the other. One hundred ninety-three patients entered the follow-up study and were followed up from 12 to 144 months (median, 64. 5 months). Five patients died during the follow-up of unrelated diseases, and in one patient, an esophageal cancer infiltrating the trachea was discovered 26 months after the operation. Clinical results were excellent or good in 93. 8 % of the patients, and fair in 2. 6 %. Disabling dysphagia recurred in seven patients (3. 6 %), six of whom required pneumatic dilation for relief and one patient who underwent reoperation because of a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Postoperative roentgenographic studies showed a significant reduction in the mean value of the maximal esophageal diameter. Esophageal manometry showed a significant reduction of lower esophageal sphincter pressure and length over preoperative values. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring showed an abnormal acid exposure in seven (8. 6 %) of 81 patients tested. Of these patients, one had erosive esophagitis on endoscopy. Esophageal transit scintigraphy, performed in 11 patients, showed a significant improvement of transit time in the erect position compared with preoperative values.

In this study, our objective was {{to carry out the}} first North American population-based study of achalasia epidemiology using a governmental administrative database. All residents in the province of Alberta, Canada receive universal healthcare coverage as a benefit. The provincial health ministry, Alberta Health and Wellness, maintains a central stakeholder database of patient demographic information and physician billing claims. We defined an achalasia case as a billing claim submitted for the years 1996 – 2007 with an ICD- 9 -CM code of 530. 0 or 530 and a Canadian Classification of Procedure treatment code of 54. 92 A (endoscopic balloon dilation) or 54. 6 (<b>esophagomyotomy).</b> A preliminary validation study of the case definition demonstrated a sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 99 % for known cases and controls. A total of 463 achalasia cases were identified from 1995 to 2008 (59. 6 % males). Mean age at diagnosis was 53. 1 [*]years. In 2007, the achalasia incidence was 1. 63 / 100 [*] 000 (95 % CI 1. 20, 2. 06) and the prevalence was 10. 82 / 100 [*] 000 (95 % CI 9. 70, 11. 93).
