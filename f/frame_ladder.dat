40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} the reconstruction of farm house to recreational house. The text part {{describes the}} owner's requirements, location of the area and building-technical survey of the existing building. With respect to the possibilities and requirements of the owner was drafted reconstruction on a holiday home. In the text section the concept of the entire proposal is described - the construction structures, design solutions, wood protection and thermal technical assessment. The building will be built as a timber <b>frame</b> <b>ladder</b> construction columnar system, such as thermal insulation material was selected from straw bales, the building envelope is designed as a diffuse open structure. It was also stated in the text of the technological process of selected construction operations. The drawings contain graphic design studies. Furthermore, the drawing part of the object based on the scope of project documentation submitted when applying for a building permit. The drawing part interferes with the implementation and production documentation...|$|E

5000|$|Again, {{the puzzle}} comes from {{considering}} the situation from the <b>frame</b> of the <b>ladder.</b> In the above analysis, {{in its own}} <b>frame,</b> the <b>ladder</b> was always longer than the garage. So how did we ever close the doors and trap it inside? ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 8: A Minkowski {{diagram of}} the case where the ladder is stopped all along its length, {{simultaneously}} in the garage frame. When this occurs, the garage <b>frame</b> sees the <b>ladder</b> as AB, but the <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> sees the <b>ladder</b> as AC. When {{the back of the}} ladder enters the garage at point D, it has not yet felt the effects of the acceleration of its front end. At this time, according to someone at rest with respect {{to the back of the}} ladder, the front of the ladder will be at point E and will see the ladder as DE. It is seen that this length in the <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> is not the same as CA, the rest length of the ladder before the deceleration.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 1: A Minkowski {{diagram of}} the case where the ladder is stopped by impact with {{the back wall of}} the garage. The impact is event A. At impact, the garage <b>frame</b> sees the <b>ladder</b> as AB, but the <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> sees the <b>ladder</b> as AC. The ladder does not move out of the garage, so its front end now goes {{directly}} upward, through point E. The back of the ladder will not change its trajectory in space-time until it feels the effects of the impact. The effect of the impact can propagate outward from A no faster than the speed of light, so the back of the ladder will never feel the effects of the impact until point F or later, at which time the ladder is well within the garage in both frames. Note that when the diagram is drawn in the <b>frame</b> of the <b>ladder,</b> the speed of light is the same, but the ladder is longer, so it takes more time for the force to reach the back end; this gives enough time for the back of the ladder to move inside the garage.|$|R

500|$|Borehole drilling: By {{at least}} the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the Chinese used deep {{borehole}} drilling for mining and other projects; The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600m (2000ft). K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: [...] "The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished {{by a team of}} men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen." [...] This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. [...] "Kicking Her Down"). A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of 100m (328ft) with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber <b>frame,</b> <b>ladders</b> and iron tools. (For further information, see the entry on [...] "natural gas as fuel" [...] below.) ...|$|R
30|$|The GRRP {{illustrates}} a major {{gap between the}} government water management systems and local community needs and desires. According to the stated goals of the GRRP, the central government wants to develop flood control and facilitate drainage {{during the rainy season}} and secure enough water during the summer that freshwater can flow to more southern points in the GDA including Khulna city, Mongla port and the Sundarbans. On the other hand, the focus group participants at Chapra explained to Hossen (2014 : 85 – 86) that they want natural resources back, like siltation, algae, earth-worms and water hyacinth, to promote cropland fertility. They also want to get back water-borne wild vegetables like marsh herb, water lily, ferns and hyacinth bean and natural fisheries like carp, barb and minnow. They {{want to be able to}} make agricultural materials like ploughshares, <b>frames,</b> <b>ladders</b> and sticks from natural resources like bamboo, cane and wood, which are now in short supply.|$|R
50|$|Prados have <b>ladder</b> <b>frames,</b> {{two-speed}} transfer {{boxes and}} rear beam axles. The J70 platform has a front beam axle while the J90, J120, and J150 platforms have front independent suspension.|$|R
50|$|All models had a <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> {{with two}} axles on semi {{elliptical}} leaf springs. A set back front axle allowed a wheelbase of only 9 ft, allowing {{a very short}} turn radius.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{mechanical}} parts {{were used in}} the form of leaf springs and four-wheel drum brakes on a <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> chassis. Body styles include a pickup (two-door, three seater), a double-cab pickup (four-door, six seater) and a two-door panel van.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate wet clutch.The chassis was {{a conventional}} <b>ladder</b> <b>frame,</b> with solid axles sprung on semi-elliptic front and three-quarter-elliptic rear leaf springs. The brakes {{were on the}} transmission and on the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Wira, the Arena is of unibody construction, but {{in order}} to sustain {{additional}} loads from the cargo bed, the Arena includes a load-bearing <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> connected to a [...] "torque box" [...] for improved body durability and strength.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{emerged from}} Mark II (X platform). It debuted in October 1991 with Crown Majesta and Aristo S140, which, {{in contrast with}} contemporary S140 Crown, featured monocoque construction instead of Crown's <b>ladder</b> <b>frame.</b> In October 1992 4WD models were added to lineup.|$|R

50|$|The Iveco Daily {{is a large}} light {{commercial}} vehicle produced by Iveco since 1978; it was also sold as the Fiat Daily by Fiat until 1983. Unlike the more car-like unibody Fiat Ducato, the Daily uses a separate <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> typical of heavier commercial vehicles.|$|R
50|$|So {{named for}} its {{resemblance}} to a <b>ladder,</b> the <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> {{is one of the}} simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.|$|R
50|$|Australian {{specification}} Terracans {{were available}} in two trim levels - base and Highlander. Highlander models came standard with leather seats, climate control airconditioning and an automatic 4wd differential that engaged 4wd on the fly. All models came with low range gearing and a separate <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> chassis.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was 6x6, {{with three}} live beam axles, adapted and {{strengthened}} for {{conditions in the}} USSR. It had a reinforced <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> with three live beam axles, the front on semi elliptical leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} based on the Volvo PV sedan and shares its engine and front {{suspension}} with that model. However, unlike the PV, which had a unibody design and a coil spring rear suspension, the Duett used a <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> with leaf springs supporting the rear.|$|R
