50|$|Quadra-Trac was {{the trade}} {{name for the}} Borg-Warner 1305 and 1339 <b>gear</b> <b>cases.</b> It was a chain-drive system {{introduced}} in 1973 on the full-sized Jeep line behind the AMC version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. CJ7s also received the Quadra-Trac starting in 1976. The BW1305 included 1) a differential with a cone-type slip-limiting clutch to distribute torque between {{the front and rear}} output shafts and 2) a vacuum-switch-operated differential lock. It offered only 4WD Hi modes in full-time (open) or part-time (locked) modes. The BW1339 added a 2.57:1 low range gearset to the BW1305, enabling 5 modes: 4WD Hi Locked, 4WD Hi Open, Neutral, 4WD Low Open, and 4WD Low Locked.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 93 - 102 Test stand {{vibration}} {{measurements on}} a partially loaded 54, 000 hp, parallel shaft, double helical speed increaser revealed synchronous resonant vibrations near normal operating speed. Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the coupling spacer, adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by coupling unbalance on the rotating pinion shaft that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie bar brace was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution. This paper documents measured vibrations at various stages in the investigation, results of rotordynamic and finite element analyses, bearing and <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> modifications, and final successful tests...|$|R

5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and <b>gear</b> <b>case</b> (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver <b>gear</b> <b>case,</b> driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
