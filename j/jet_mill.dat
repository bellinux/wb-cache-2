The effect of milling pressure, feed rate, vibration rate of feeder, and feedback of <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> on whole wheat flour functionality and the potential of those flours for breadmaking with the goal of improving bread quality and digestibility were investigated. Increasing milling pressure (from 4 to 8  bar), decreasing feed rate (from 0. 67 to 5. 18  kg/h), and/or using recirculation augmented the severity of the process and reduced flour particle size from 84. 15 to 17. 02  μm. Breakage of aleurone particle layer and the reduction of particle size in <b>jet</b> <b>milled</b> flours were detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

At Delft University a project has been started to achieve a considerable energy reduction of the milling process. Main feature of the improved grinding system will be an operation control based on in-line particle size measurement using the laser diffraction technique. The pilot plant is equipped with an external classifier for the removal and recirculation of larger particles leaving the <b>jet</b> <b>mill.</b> Phenomena occurring in the mill are not yet well modeled and thus no real optimization of the grinding process can be achieved. Operation conditions of jet mills are still determined by trial and error. This paper is to {{form the basis of}} a model which allows a dynamic modeling of the behavior of the jet mill/classifier system. The closed loop grinding system has been split in 3 subsystems (zones), two internal to the mill and one external through which the particles pass.

Carob flour particle size was controlled by fractionation or <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> application. Quality features of gluten-free breads containing carob flour and commercially available gluten-free breads were compared. Carob flour addition led to breads with improved colour parameters, crumb structure, retarded firming and lower moisture loss compared to rice bread. Further improvement in specific volume, crumb hardness, protein and ash content and estimated glycaemic index (eGI) could be obtained by a careful selection of the particle size distribution of the carob flour. Carob breads prepared either with the coarsest or the finest fraction prepared using <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> led to end products with the highest specific volume (≈ 2. 2 g/cm 3) and the lowest crumb hardness (≈ 5. 5 N), although they had lower specific volume and harder crumbs than breads from commercial blends (≈ 3 – 4 g/cm 3, 0. 6 – 3. 8 N).

Research for utilizing of different waste materials in these applications is environmentally important. In this work, the ultrafine grinding of two waste gypsum materials, namely FGD (Flue Gas Desulphurisation) gypsum and phosphogypsum from a phosphoric acid plant, with the attrition bead mill and with the <b>jet</b> <b>mill</b> has been studied. The ' objective {{of this research was}} to test the suitability of the attrition bead mill and of the <b>jet</b> <b>mill</b> to produce gypsum powders with a particle size of a few microns. The grinding conditions were optimised by studying the influences of different operational grinding parameters on the grinding rate and on the energy consumption of the process in order to achieve a product fineness such as that required in the paper industry with as low energy consumption as possible. Based on experimental results, the most influential parameters in the attrition grinding were found to be the bead size, the stirrer type, and the stirring speed. The best conditions, based on the product fineness and specific energy consumption of grinding, for the attrition grinding process is to grind the material with small grinding beads and a high rotational speed of the stirrer. Also, by using some suitable grinding additive, a finer product is achieved with a lower energy consumption. In <b>jet</b> <b>mill</b> grinding the most influential parameters were the feed rate, the volumetric flow rate of the grinding air, and the height of the internal classification tube. The optimised condition for the jet is to grind with a small feed rate and with a large rate of volumetric flow rate of grinding air when the inside tube is low. The finer product with a larger rate of production was achieved with the attrition bead mill than with the <b>jet</b> <b>mill,</b> thus the attrition grinding is better for the ultrafine grinding of gypsum than the jet grinding.

An increase in silk degumming intensity, through increased alkali concentration, treatment temperature, and time, reduced the fibroin {{molecular weight}} and, therefore, the fiber tenacity, {{but at the}} same time, increased the Beta-sheet fraction. These changes reduced the time required to mill the degummed silk fibers into fine powders.

40|$|Dry milling in {{combination}} with air classification was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional wet extraction of protein from yellow field peas (Pisum sativum). Major advantages of dry fractionation are retention of native functionality of proteins and its lower energy and water use. Peas were ground by impact (ZPS 50) and <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> (AFG 100) at various classifier wheel speeds to provide pea flours with different particle size distributions, protein contents and damaged starch levels. Peas were milled under various conditions to maximally disentangle starch granules from the surrounding protein bodies. The optimal milling conditions were confirmed by particle size analysis and scanning electron microscope imaging. Too extensive milling, e. g. using ultrafine impact or <b>jet</b> <b>milling,</b> resulted in very fine flours (with D 0. 5 < 10 µm) with poor flowability, whereas ultrafine <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> led to an increased percentage of damaged starch. Subsequently, air classification was applied to separate small fragments (primarily protein bodies) from the coarse fraction (starch granules) to obtain enriched protein concentrates. Protein concentrates were obtained with protein contents between 51 % and 55 % (w/dw) and a maximum protein recovery of 77 %. Deviating cut-off size for air classification could be ascribed to build-up of material between the vanes of the classifier wheel. Finally, water holding capacity (WHC) tests were used to evaluate the functional properties of the pea protein concentrates. A liquid pea concentrate comprising 26 % (w/w) of protein could be prepared from dry pea concentrates containing more than 30 % (w/dw) of pea protein. This was explained by the high solubility of pea protein in its native state. After heat treatment of pea protein concentrates, a gel with a high WHC of 4. 8 g water (w/w) was obtained, which decreased with increasing protein content. Functional properties of the pea protein concentrates are interesting for preparation of high-protein foods or for replacement of egg protein functionalit...|$|R

The simplifying model is then successfully applied and enables to derive the fMat. parameters. In our situation, the experimental data do not show a direct relationship between fMat. and the minimum breakage energy and sieve cut size for all the materials...|$|E

With {{the help}} of the {{scanning}} electron microscope, the superfine powders produced from 8 kinds of materials by <b>Jet</b> <b>Mill</b> were experimentally investigated and were qualitatively analyzed based on the stress wave theory and the crystallography theory. It was found that the crystal structure had a decisive influence on the shape of particles, and the shape of non-crystal particles occurred at random. The particle materials produced from intensive impulsive loading maintained their original properties. The unbalanced crack extension, which caused by the defects of materials or other factors, was the main factor of material destruction...|$|E

However, neither the particle size can reach the nanoscale, nor are the shapes uniform. LF-FSP directly produces nanopowders that are not possible via grinding. Uniform particle size distributions are obtained using LF-FSP {{as it is a}} vapor phase process. For instance, Al2O3 nanopowders produced from LF-FSP have an average particle size (APS) of 20-150 nm with a log-normal particle size distribution.|$|R

Kinematic and dynamic characteristics of elastic and inelastic collisions of particles of processed rhombic sulfur with rows of disintegrator fingers are calculated. Based on {{the analysis of the}} obtained dependency of the rotation frequency of the rotors offers, advices on selecting optimal conditions for activation milling of α-sulfur in the disintegrator are given. These results can be partially used in the processing of sulfur and in other types of shock grinding devices, in particular, <b>jet</b> <b>mills...</b>|$|R
50|$|Toner has {{traditionally}} been made by compounding the ingredients and creating a slab which was broken or pelletized, then turned into a fine powder with a controlled particle size range by air <b>jet</b> <b>milling.</b> This process results in toner granules with varying sizes and aspherical shapes. To get a finer print, some companies are using a chemical process to grow toner particles from molecular reagents. This results in more uniform size and shapes of toner particles. The smaller, uniform shapes permit more accurate colour reproduction and more efficient toner use.|$|R
