Our contributions are threefold: First, we identify the components {{of a system that}} realizes the concept of <b>extended</b> e-mail <b>addresses</b> and investigate the functionality of these components in a manner which is backwards compatible to current e-mail tools. Secondly, we specify an adversarial model, and give the necessary properties of <b>extended</b> e-mail <b>addresses</b> and of the procedure to obtain them {{in the presence of the}} adversary.

40|$|LUN value meaning {{unspecified}} LU PROBLEM: In management applications (and possibly elsewhere), {{the need}} sometimes arises to indicate explicitly {{that the value}} for a parameter is not specified. It is not always practical to add a flag for each parameter indicating this situation. In trying to extend the Fibre Channel HBA API to handle some unforeseen configurations, it has become necessary to indicate that a required LUN field within a fixed larger structure does not contain a specific LUN. PROPOSAL: It was originally thought to use an otherwise reserved LUN to indicate that a real LUN is not specified; however, this risks that the reserved LUN may someday be defined for another purpose. It is proposed in the following to define a LUN that references no entity whatsoever. A currently reserved <b>extended</b> <b>address</b> method and a method specific <b>address</b> within that <b>extended</b> <b>address</b> method are recommended for this purpose...|$|R

Such a value may {{also be used as}} a sentinel value to initialize newly allocated memory for debugging purposes.|$|E
50|$|Address resolution: IPv6 nodes are {{assigned}} 128 bit IP addresses in a hierarchical manner, through an arbitrary length network prefix. IEEE 802.15.4 devices may use either of IEEE 64 bit <b>extended</b> <b>addresses</b> or, after an association event, 16 bit addresses that are unique within a PAN.

50|$|Functional {{upgrades}} for the KL-10 processor architecture were limited. The {{most significant}} new feature (called <b>extended</b> <b>addressing)</b> was modified pager microcode {{running on a}} Model B hardware revision to enlarge the user virtual address space. Some effective address calculations by instructions located beyond the original 18-bit address space were performed to 30 significant bits, although only a 23-bit virtual address space was supported. Program code located in the original 18-bit address space had unchanged semantics, for backward compatibility.|$|E

30|$|Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) is a {{promising}} {{technology for the}} next generation of automotive vehicles. Recent advancements in IVC enabled the use of a wide range of traffic safety and efficiency applications. In order to unify and expand services provided by IVC, it is necessary to integrate IVC systems with the Internet. IPv 6 with its features, such as <b>extended</b> <b>address</b> space, embedded security, enhanced mobility support and ease of configuration, is the most appropriate candidate for the task.|$|R
50|$|Although {{fundamentally}} a 16-bit architecture, some versions (such as the Z8001) had 7-bit segment registers that <b>extended</b> the <b>address</b> {{space to}} 8 megabytes.|$|R
5000|$|The 1900 Series, which {{derived from}} the Canadian Ferranti-Packard 6000, competed {{successfully}} in the UK with the IBM System/360 range from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. The basic design {{was based on a}} 24 bit word, divided up into 6 bit characters. Lower case and control characters were provided for by [...] "shift" [...] characters. The early machines (1904/1905 with hardware floating point) were only 15 bit addressing. Later machines (1904E, 1905E, 1906A) had <b>extended</b> <b>addressing</b> modes up to 22 bits.|$|E
5000|$|The NEC V33 is a super {{version of}} the V30 that {{separates}} address bus and data bus, and executes all instructions with wired logic instead of micro-codes, making it {{twice as fast as}} a V30 for the same clock frequency. V33 has the performance equivalent to Intel 80286. NEC V33 offers a method to expanding the memory address space to 16M bytes. It has two additional instructions [...] and [...] to support <b>extended</b> <b>addressing</b> mode. The 8080 emulation mode was not supported.|$|E
5000|$|Later, the [...] "Model B" [...] {{version of}} the 2060 {{processors}} removed the 256 kiloword limitation on the virtual address space, by allowing the use of up to 32 [...] "sections" [...] of up to 256 kilowords each, along with substantial changes to the instruction set. [...] "Model A" [...] and [...] "Model B" [...] KL10 processors {{can be thought of}} as being different CPUs. The first operating system that took advantage of the Model B's capabilities was TOPS-20 release 3, and user mode <b>extended</b> <b>addressing</b> was offered in TOPS-20 release 4. TOPS-20 versions after release 4.1 would only run on a Model B.|$|E
50|$|PICs {{have a set}} of {{registers}} {{that function}} as general-purpose RAM. Special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space. The addressability of memory varies depending on device series, and all PIC devices have some banking mechanism to <b>extend</b> <b>addressing</b> to additional memory. Later series of devices feature move instructions, which can cover the whole addressable space, independent of the selected bank. In earlier devices, any register move had to be achieved through the accumulator.|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} {{projects}} and researches {{based on the}} integration of IVC systems and Internet. This integration is only possible {{with the use of}} IPv 6 with its features, such as <b>extended</b> <b>address</b> space, embedded security, enhanced mobility support and ease of configuration. ETSI TC ITS and ISO TC 204 developed a set of standards for cooperative ITS, which allow ITS stations including vehicles, road infrastructures and other peers to be reachable through the Internet to cooperate and exchange information with each other for road safety, traffic efficiency and infotainment services.|$|R
50|$|Some {{motherboards}} came {{equipped with}} a 32-bit bus called EISA that was backward compatible with the ISA-standard. EISA offered a number of attractive features such as increased bandwidth, <b>extended</b> <b>addressing,</b> IRQ sharing, and card configuration through software (rather than through jumpers, DIP switches, etc.) However, EISA cards were expensive and therefore mostly employed in servers and workstations. Consumer desktops often used the simpler but faster VESA Local Bus (VLB), unfortunately somewhat prone to electrical and timing-based instability; typical consumer desktops had ISA slots combined with a single VLB slot for a video card. VLB was gradually replaced by PCI during {{the final years of}} the 80486 period. Few Pentium class motherboards had VLB support as VLB was based directly on the i486 bus; it was no trivial matter adapting it to the quite different P5 Pentium-bus. ISA persisted through the P5 Pentium generation and was not completely displaced by PCI until the Pentium III era.|$|E
40|$|Major {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the IBM version of COSMIC/NASTRAN by RPK Corporation under contract to IBM Corporation. These improvements will become part of COSMIC's IBM version and will be available {{in the second quarter of}} 1989. The first improvement is the inclusion of code to take advantage of IBM's new Vector Facility (VF) on its 3090 machines. The remaining improvements are modifications that will benefit all users as a result of the <b>extended</b> <b>addressing</b> capability provided by the MVS/XA operating system. These improvements include the availability of an in-memory data base that potentially eliminates the need for I/O to the PRIxx disk files. Another improvement is the elimination of multiple load modules that have to be loaded for every link switch within NASTRAN. The last improvement allows for NASTRAN to execute above the 16 mega-byte line. This improvement allows for NASTRAN to have access to 2 giga-bytes of memory for open core and the in-memory data base...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-high Performance Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) {{has emerged}} around 25 {{years ago as}} a {{fruitful}} result of dedicated research efforts based on the combination of three main ideas : Strength and compactness improvement of cement materials by intense reduction of the water to binder ratio, which was made more and more possible and efficient with R&D advances in superplasticizers and mineral additions; Use of fibers to provide post-cracking tensile capacity and pseudo-ductility, which was made possible thanks to more than two decades of conceptual and exploratory development of conventional fiber-reinforced concrete, and really efficient as compared to it due to the high quality of the matrix and the possiblity to incorporate high amounts of fibers; Reduction of natural imperfections due to aggregate in limiting their size and selecting very high quality materials in an optimized grading, which took benefit of aggregate packing models having being developed in the late 80 s. This combination enabled to produce several industrially controlled patented materials markedly overpassing the highest high-performance concrete available at this time, with 150 MPa-characteristic compressive strength at least, and possibly dispensing with the traditional use of secondary reinforcement due to material non-brittleness and with thick cover in aggressive environment. This allowed dispensing with keeping systematic continuity with traditional reinforced concrete design provisions. Moreover, mixing, placement, thermal treatment and formwork technology could be kept understood in the continuity with emerging self-compacting concrete. Twenty years ago, the first major applications, Sherbrooke footbridge (Canada) and prestressed beams for the renovation of the heat exchange zone in the cooling towers of Cattenom power plant (France), demonstrated outstanding strength and resistance to transfer, so that durability and lightness of prestressed members have appeared as main advantages to be searched in structural applications. The first recommendations for production, characterization of UHPFRC and structural design using these materials, published in France in 2002 [1], made it possible to explore the implementation possibilities of such materials especially for pre-stressed structures and non-reinforced thin elements. Application to bridges and footbridges (Bourg-lès-Valence in 2001, Sakata Mirai and Seoul - Seon Yu Footbridges in 2002, Pinel bridge in 2006, passerelle des Anges in 2008) motivated consistent research efforts to ensure controlled quality of the material produced and placed, and safe design provisions of lighter and thinner structures. Optimized shapes, like ITE® beams, ribbed slabs or shells, were demonstrated as favourable for valuable implementation, while cost-efficiency also relied on indirect material savings or lightness benefits for the method of execution. Besides valuable application in structural components, UHPFRC has been adopted for a decade by architects to develop attractive façade and roofing components, thanks to new aesthetic possibilities associated to durable mineral surface quality, lightness and possible complex shapes and semi-transparency, with typical examples of Villa Navarra roof and 'Les enfants du Paradis' net panels in 2007. For such elements, the use of organic or stainless steel fibres was developed, the range of mixes was <b>extended</b> <b>addressing</b> the fire-resistance demand and the possibly lower strength requirements, and ribbed plates or shells with passive reinforcement in the stiffeners tended to appear as structurally efficient. Growing interest and economic significance of this development in building applications turned out evident from the first international symposium strictly dedicated to UHPFRC applications, organized in Marseille (France) in 2009 [2]. From the same time however, UHPFRC produced volume took off also for less visible, however technically optimized projects of the extension of Haneda Airport in Tokyo, light prestressed bridges in Malaysia, or joint fills between precast beams in North American projects of 'accelerated bridge (re) construction'. The year 2013, associated to the second UHPFRC international symposium organized in Marseille [3] and revised edition of AFGC Recommendations, has constituted a significant milestone for UHPFRC in France. Two major projects associated to urban renovation, the MuCEM in Marseille (Fig. 1) and the Jean Bouin Stadium in Paris, had been completed, having led to widened awareness of technical and architectural capabilities of these 'new concretes' both among professional (architects and engineers) and for the public, including clients of constructions. Technical acceptance of the design, industrial processes and details associated to these projects, as well as previous satisfactory French 15 years-experience of building components and bridges made of UHPFRC, has made it possible to launch the standardization process in France. This has resulted in the elaboration of three complementary standards, related to UHPFRC structural design, material production and control, and execution of structures. The first two documents have been published in French and English in 2016 [4 - 5], the latter one is expected for 2017, as well as updating of the standard 'common rules' for precast concrete products. Although based on the technical consensus expressed in AFGC recommendations revised in 2013, the standards elaboration has promoted clarification and simplification of the ordering / qualification processes for easier UHPFRC contract implementation. Since 2013, international recognition especially within ACI Excellence in Concrete Construction Awards program has been gained not only for the MuCEM and Jean Bouin Stadium in 2015, but also for the 'Ring of Memory' at International Memorial of Notre-Dame de Lorette in 2016. Noticeably enough, due to optimization in conceptual design, UHPFRC has made possible competitive solutions not only for tailor-made projects, but also for typical bridge situations exemplified by the Buthaumont Bridge and the footbridge at Le Cannet des Maures. In Switzerland with the iconic example of Chillon viaducts, in the US with the Pulaski viaduct restoration, and progressively also in France, bridge deck repair or protection using UHPFRC has deserved increasing interest. Repair solutions, for buildings also, are increasingly considering UHPFRC due to specific versatility, structural and durability performance and weight savings, which results in cost-efficiency despite a possibly still high unitary material cost. However, the driving field of UHPFRC application in France has concerned cladding and roofing panels, for buildings (e. g. 'Vente Privée' Headquarters, 'La Mantilla' buildings [...] .) and for large infrastructure projects (e. g. Montpellier high speed railway station). UHPFRC solutions based on ultra-thin, highly transparent and architecturally appealing elements have thus been made possible in a cost-efficient way due to the lightness of these secondary elements. Consolidation of engineering and industrial know-how is a key condition for further development of such applications. This has been the case among several architects, designers, checkers, engineering offices, and precasting plants, although quite few. Education associated to the standards dissemination should strengthen these capabilities. Further research and development efforts should address advanced UHPFRC modelling, seismic design with UHPFRC, development of typical 'UHPFRC solutions', and non-conventional process optimization (sprayed UHPFRC, 3 D printing etc.) which could widen the scope of cost-efficient UHPFRC implementation...|$|E
