40|$|Master's thesis in International {{hotel and}} tourism {{management}}There {{is no doubt}} that management of communication in business is a key. In hospitality industry that is service – based, the key role of communication becomes even more important especially for service providers as hotels. On the other hand, social media is probably the most applied communication platform of today’s world with its’ exclusive role in daily lives of people and this demand continues to increase. The research question is to analyze “How is social media communication competence and importance perceived and to what extent social media communication competence is implemented by business hotel managers within tourism industry in Norway and Turkey?” People communicate through traditional and social media at the present time. However, do those communicators have adequate competencies in order to communicate appropriately and effectively through social media? As {{it is well known that}} communication is the way of people express themselves to others which could be both business and private life related. Is the role of social media communication and its competencies understood adequately by business segment hotel managers at the present time in tourism industry? My own background for undertaking this study is that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>from</b> <b>Izmir,</b> Turkey and I am currently studying in masters degree of ‘International Hotel and Tourism Leadership’ at The University of Stavanger and work part – time in one of the hotel chains in Stavanger, Norway. This fact that I have chance to observe Norway while studying along with hometown motivates me as researcher to make a research by conducting one – to – one interviews with managers of the hotel chains in Izmir, home city, and Stavanger, current city in order to understand hotel managers’ approaches to the specified research area and what sort of differences and similarities exist in Norway and Turkey...|$|E

C. closterium <b>was</b> isolated <b>from</b> <b>Izmir</b> Bay. The present study were performed under optimum light and nutrient saturated conditions except the nutrient, which was investigated. An exponential growth rate was obtained by using each growth curves. The exponential growth rates were plotted against corresponding each nutrient concentrations. The parameters of Monod curve were calculated with the least square method by using transformations to linear form. Half Saturation Constant (Ks) was calculated for only silicate as 9. 58 μM maximum growth rate were found as 4. 32 day - 1...|$|R

50|$|Manisa {{was one of}} {{the first}} cities in the Ottoman Empire to benefit from the arrival of a railway line, with the 93 km Smyrna Cassaba Railway, whose {{construction}} <b>was</b> started <b>from</b> <b>İzmir</b> in 1863 and which reached its first terminus at Manisa's depending Kasaba in 1866. This railway was the third started within the territory of the Ottoman Empire at the time and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey. Instead of being laid along the direct route eastwards <b>from</b> <b>İzmir</b> to Kasaba, about fifty kilometers in length, the line built drew a wide arc advancing first to the north-west <b>from</b> <b>İzmir,</b> through its Karşıyaka suburb to whose foundation it contributed greatly, and curves eastwards only from Menemen on, crossing the former sanjak and the present-day province center of Manisa to join Kasaba (now Turgutlu) from the north. The first concession under the name was granted to a locally based English entrepreneur named Edward Price, who founded the company and built the line. This railway was extended further east by the same company between 1872 - 1875 to reach Alaşehir at a distance of 76 km from Kasaba and a connection northwards starting <b>from</b> Manisa itself <b>was</b> built between 1888 - 1890 to reach the lignite-rich Soma, another dependency of Manisa, through a 92 km line. Price sold the whole network in 1893 to theFranco - Belgian group Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which extended it further east to Afyonkarahisar in 1896 and further north to Bandırma in 1912. The line was nationalized in 1934 by the young Republic of Turkey in the frame of a general move started in the 1920s regarding Turkey's railways.|$|R
