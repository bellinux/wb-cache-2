40|$|Mechanical Behaviour of <b>Adhesive</b> <b>Layers</b> Methods to Extract Peel and Mixed Mode Properties TOBIAS ANDERSSON Department of Applied Mechanics Chalmers University of Technology ABSTRACT This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with methods to extract material properties of thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> loaded in peel and in mixed mode. The {{first part of the}} thesis is devoted to an experimental method to determine the complete stress-elongation relation (or cohesive law) for an <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> loaded in peel using the DCB-specimen. The method is based on the concept of equilibrium of the energetic forces acting on the specimen. Two sources of energetic forces are identified: the start of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> and the positions of the two acting loads. By use of the concept of equilibrium of energetic forces, it is possible to measure the energy release rate of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> instantaneously during an experiment. The complete stress-elongation relation is found to be the derivative of the energy release rate with respect to the elongation of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> at its start. By this procedure, an effective property of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> is measured. The validity of the approach is investigated by experiments where the adherends deform 1) elastically and 2) plastically. It is found that a unique stress-elongation is obtained when the adherends deform elastically. The same relation cannot be used to predict the experiments where the adherends deform plastically indicating that the approach has limited applicability. 	The second part of the thesis {{is concerned with}} the development of a mesomechanical finite element model of a thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> loaded in mixed mode. The model is calibrated to previously performed experiments. In these, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> is loaded in monotonically increasing peel or shear. An in situ SEM-study is also performed and used to guide the modelling and calibration. The purpose of the mesomechanical finite element model is to facilitate the development of constitutive laws for <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> The modelling is based on Xu and Needlemans method where all continuum finite-elements are surrounded by interface elements that allow for the development of micro cracks. Thus, this enables the modelling of the entire process of degradation and fracture of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> A genetic algorithm is developed for the calibration. The simulations are shown to be in reasonably good agreement with the experiments.

40|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} for measuring the linear viscoelastic properties of thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> and for determining the stress intensity factor characterizing the driving force for adhesive failure. Both methods involve bringing a hemispherical indenter in contact with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> while simultaneously monitoring the load, displacement, and radius of contact between the indenter and the adhesive. Dynamic moduli for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> are obtained by oscillating the indenter, and the adhesive properties are obtained by pulling the indenter completely out of contact with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> Existing theories of viscoelastic contact mechanics were extended to account {{for the fact that the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is not substantially larger than the contact radius, as is generally assumed. A variety of correction factors were introduced that depend on the ratio of the contact radius to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. These methods were applied to a model adhesive based on an acrylic triblock copolymer. Determination of the time-dependent creep and relaxation functions for this material was simplified by the power-law frequency response of the dynamic moduli.

In other words, these systems provide examples where the cohesive tractions exerted by an <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> can be calculated simply from considerations of the constrained deformation of the adhesive. Consistent with such calculations, the peak stress in the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> decreases {{as the level of}} the constraint decreases (either with an increase in the thickness of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> or with a decrease in the thickness of the adherends).

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{manufacturing}} of multi-material products, a {{joining method}} that {{is able to}} cost-effectively assemble components made of dissimilar and similar material, with irregular geometries, is optimal. As an alternative, adhesive bonding is in-creasingly adapted by the industry, which is also used in manufacturing of multi-phase materials. In practice, adhesives are constrained to thin <b>layers.</b> An <b>adhesive</b> as a constrained layer behaves differently compared to the adhesive as a bulk material. In general, <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> are loaded in peel (mode I), or in shear (mode II or III), or in a combination of peel and shear (mixed mode). This thesis deals with mixed mode loaded <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> from measurement of ma-terial data to analysis of structural behaviour. For studying of structural behaviour of adhesive joints, an integrated approach is developed. Arbitrarily end-loaded single-layer adhesive joints with arbitrary ad-herends of arbitrary length are analysed with the Beam/Adhesive layer (B/A) model. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> {{as well as for}} the adherends. For joints with a semi-infinite symmetric geometry, i. e. relative long joints with identical adherends loaded at one end, basic loading cases are obtained. Solutions to these basic loading cases are easy to use in designing of joints with this type of geometry. For nonlinear or general <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> a mode-dependent cohesive law is de-veloped. The normalized formulation is easy to implement in numerical simula-tions, yet, it captures the characteristics of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> For experimental studies, this cohesive law is used to obtain the constitutive behaviour of an adhe-sive layer. The results confirm the ability and suitability of this cohesive law in modelling of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> To obtain material data of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> experimental methods are developed based on the J-integral. Two specimens, the Mixed mode double Cantilever Beams (MCB) specimen and the Unbalanced Double Cantilever Beams (UDCB) specimen, are designed to allow <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> to be loaded in mixed mode.

40|$|The Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) test is an {{established}} method {{to determine the}} critical strain energy release rate of adhesives in mode I.
