ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer of <b>the</b> early <b>era</b> (1975 – 1990) with those of <b>the</b> late <b>era</b> (1991 – 1997). Background Preoperative therapy {{has been used in}} locally advanced rectal cancer to preserve sphincter function, decrease local recurrence, and improve survival. At the University of Florida, preoperative radiation has been used since 1975, and it was combined with chemotherapy beginning <b>in</b> 1991. Methods <b>The</b> records of 328 patients who underwent preoperative radiation or chemoradiation followed by complete resection for locally advanced rectal cancer defined as tethered, annular, or fixed tumors were reviewed. The clinicopathologic characteristics, adjuvant treatment administered, surgical procedures performed, and local recurrence-free and overall survival rates were analyzed. Results There were 219 patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>era</b> and 109 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>era.</b> No significant differences were seen in patients (age, gender, race) or tumor characteristics (mean distance from the anal verge, annularity, fixation). Preoperative radiation regimens were radiobiologically comparable. No patient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>era</b> received preoperative chemotherapy, compared with 64 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>era.</b> Of those receiving any pre- or postoperative chemotherapy, three patients received chemotherapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>era,</b> compared with 76 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>era.</b> Sphincter-preserving procedures increased from 13 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>era</b> to 52 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>era.</b> Pathologic downstaging for depth of invasion increased from 42 % to 58 %, but lymph node negativity remained similar. The 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year local recurrence-free survival rates were comparable. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>era,</b> 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year overall survival rates improved significantly compared with those of <b>the</b> early <b>era,</b> and also compared with each of the preceding 5 -year intervals.

The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, which killed 123, the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, and {{was at the time}} the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E
5|$|After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were {{restored}} in the Second Polish Republic, {{although they were}} called sejms rather than sejmiks. They included the short-lived Sejm of Central Lithuania (1921–1922); the three voivodeship sejms (Silesian Parliament, Greater Poland Sejm, and Pomeranian Sejm, 1920–1939), which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the county sejmiks, of which there were 264 in 1939.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>era</b> of Ottoman rule, and {{especially}} from the 17th to the 19th century, the local Greek Orthodox communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of Zagori acquired an autonomous status inside the Ottoman Empire, whereby the locals were exempt from the fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities. During this period large groups of villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions. In such an environment, the art of herbal healing by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.|$|E
