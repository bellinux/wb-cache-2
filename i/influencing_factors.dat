25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all <b>influencing</b> <b>factors,</b> causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{assert that}} culture is {{one factor that}} {{plays a role in}} aggression. Tribal or band societies existing before or outside of modern states have sometimes been depicted as peaceful 'noble savages'. The ǃKung people were described as 'The Harmless People' in a popular work by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas in 1958, while Lawrence Keeley's 1996 War Before Civilization suggested that regular warfare without modern technology was conducted by most groups throughout human history, including most Native American tribes. Studies of hunter-gatherers show a range of different societies. In general, aggression, conflict and violence sometimes occur, but direct confrontation is generally avoided and conflict is socially managed by a variety of verbal and non-verbal methods. Different rates of aggression or violence, currently or in the past, within or between groups, have been linked to the structuring of societies and environmental conditions <b>influencing</b> <b>factors</b> such as resource or property acquisition, land and subsistence techniques, and population change.|$|E

Schmertmann's (1970) method {{is one of the}} most rational methods for computing settlements of footings in granular soils, and is commonly used world-wide. The method relies on a strain <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> that varies with depth. Schmertmann et al. (1978) proposed separate strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> for axi-symmetric and plane strain loading situations, representing circular and strip footings. The objective of this paper is to revisit Schmertmann's <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> using FLAC and FLAC 3 D, explicit finite difference codes used widely in geotechnical modelling, and the theory of elasticity. Linear elastic and non-linear elastic constitutive models were used in the analysis. The <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> derived are compared with those proposed by Schmertmann. For square and rectangular footings, the problem becomes three-dimensional and therefore FLAC 3 D was used in the analysis. The strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> are developed for footings with breadth/length ratios of 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 0. The strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> for the rectangular footings are presented along with those for the circular and strip footings. The effect of Poisson's ratio was also investigated. While verifying the original strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors,</b> the new factors proposed for the rectangular footings will be valuable in the design of shallow foundations on granular soils. The use of non-linear elastic constitutive model is more realistic than the traditional linear elastic model, and the differences are discussed...|$|R
