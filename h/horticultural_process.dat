The garden is in the same position as every other work of man's art; it {{is a result of the}} cosmic process working through and by human energy and intelligence; and, as is the case with every other artificial thing set up in the state of nature, the influences of the latter, are constantly tending to break it down and destroy it. No doubt, the Forth bridge and an ironclad in the offing, are, in ultimate resort, products of the cosmic process; as much so as the river which flows under the one, or the seawater on which the other floats. Nevertheless, every breeze strains the bridge a little, every tide does something to weaken its foundations; every change of temperature alters the adjustment of its parts, produces friction and consequent wear and tear. From time to time, the bridge must be repaired, just as the ironclad must go into dock; simply because nature is always tending to reclaim that which her child, man, has borrowed from her and has arranged in combinations which are not those favoured by the general cosmic process.|$|E

Every crop production in general and cash crops and fruits in particular are weighted and valued on the basis of their market value. Marketing of horticultural product is directly associated with availability of markets besides social and economic status of the cultivators. Marketing of the produce may be carried forward either by directly or indirectly. It is affected by various factors ranging from availability of cold stores and local markets to transportation and commission agent charges besides political environment of that particular region. The reasons which propagate these problems are illiteracy and unawareness of horticulturalists, faulty institutional loan systems and lack of industries and factories for processing of the produce.

40|$|The {{language}} of plants saturated the English print marketplace {{in the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, as printers turned out an extraordinary number of instructional manuals on gardening and husbandry, retailing useful knowledge to a growing class of literate landowners and pleasure gardeners. In those same decades, increasing numbers of miscellanies were issued under titles drawn from the world of plants: poetical gardens, devotional nosegays, forests and bowers of practical wisdom. 2 ̆ 2 Bound Flowers, Loose Leaves 2 ̆ 2 examines these parallel trends as part of a single phenomenon. Against the unknowns of a new and expanding market, the <b>horticultural</b> <b>processes</b> evoked by these diverse texts naturalize the anonymous futures of print publication, situating the new adventure of print within that most ancient discipline of risk management: agriculture. This dissertation argues that these vegetable discourses fundamentally shaped how English readers understood the printed book. With remarkable frequency, printed books turned to a botanical idiom to describe their prodigious capacity to scatter, gather, and multiply, especially in the small literary forms of couplets, posies, and sentences. Showing how plant life became fundamental to how the world was imagined and known in print, I argue that the portability of these 2 ̆ 2 handles of knowledge, 2 ̆ 2 in Philip Sidney 2 ̆ 7 s phrase, drove the production of both figurative language and natural knowledge in early modern England. In readings of popular instruction manuals and miscellanies as well as works by Isabella Whitney, George Gascoigne, Francis Bacon, and William Shakespeare, I show how these practical instructions and poetic figures organize a fictive reading public, imagined as dispersed consumers of scattered textual copies. ...|$|R

Domestic Support and Border Measures for <b>Processed</b> <b>Horticultural</b> Products In horticultural markets, trade barriers often apply to the processed products whereas domestic support applies to farm-produced raw commodities. Here we assess the effects of such trade barriers and domestic support by simulating the effects of policy reform on global processing tomato markets, which are faced with modest processed product tariffs and high domestic support in the European Union (EU). Both protection and EU subsidy drive down world welfare, but we find that reducing import tariffs for tomato products would yield greater effects on markets and larger welfare impacts outside Europe than would reductions in EU domestic support. Key words: agricultural trade policy, equilibrium displacement model, EU subsidies, horticulture, processing tomatoes, tariffs, welfare analysis, WTO negotiations.

40|$|Horticulture may {{be defined}} as the {{intensive}} cultivation and harvesting of plants for financial, environmental and social profit. Evidence for the occurrence of climate change more generally and reasons why this process is happening with such rapidity are discussed. These changes are then considered in terms of the effects which might alter the options for worldwide intensive horticultural cultivation of plants and its interactions with other organisms. Potentially changing climates will have considerable impact upon <b>horticultural</b> <b>processes</b> and productivity across the globe. Climate change will alter the growth patterns and capabilities for flowering and fruiting of many perennial and annual horticultural plants. In some regions perennial fruit crops are likely to experience substantial difficulties because of altered seasonal conditions affecting dormancy, acclimation and subsequent flowering and fruiting. Elsewhere these crops may benefit from the effects of climate change as a result of reduced cold damage and increased length of the growing season. There will be considerable effects for aerial and edaphic microbes invertebrate and vertebrate animals which have benign and pathogenic interactions with horticultural plants. Microbial activity and as a consequence soil fertility may alter. New pests and pathogens may become prevalent and damaging in areas where the climate previously excluded their activity. Vital resources such as water and nutrients may become scarce in some regions reducing opportunities for growing horticultural crops. Wind and windiness are significant factors governing the success of horticultural plants and the scale of their impacts may change as climate alters. Damaging winds could limit crop growing in areas where previously it flourished. Forms of macro- and micro-landscaping will change as the spectrum of plants which can be cultivated alters and the availability of resources and their cost changes driven by scarcities brought about by climate change.

L-PEACH uses L-systems both to {{simulate the}} development of tree structure and to solve differential equations for carbohydrate flow and allocation. New L-system-based algorithms are devised for simulating the behavior of dynamically changing structures made of hundreds of interacting, time-varying, nonlinear components. L-PEACH incorporates a carbon-allocation model driven by source-sink interactions between tree components. Storage and mobilization of carbohydrates during the annual life cycle of a tree are taken into account. Carbohydrate production in the leaves is simulated based on the availability of water and light. Apices, internodes, leaves and fruit grow according to the resulting local carbohydrate supply. L-PEACH outputs an animated three-dimensional visual representation of the growing tree and user-specified statistics that characterize selected stages of plant development. The model is applied to simulate a tree's response to fruit thinning and changes in water stress.

Consumers are very heterogeneous {{and it is}} challenging to determine specific product attributes that impact their purchasing choices. To investigate consumer behavior regarding horticultural products, I conducted two experiments: 1) Consumers preferences for longevity information and guarantees on cut flower arrangements, and 2) Does visual attention to product attributes on minimally <b>processed</b> <b>horticultural</b> products impact consumers' preferences? 	For the cut flower arrangement study an internet choice experiment was conducted in 2011. Significant variation was found in consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for differing longevity lengths and guarantees. Specifically, participants were more likely to select and pay premiums for cut flower arrangements with longer vase life longevity and a guarantee. Using Ward's linkage cluster analysis, three distinct consumer clusters were developed: guarantee seekers, value conscious consumers, and spenders. Forty-nine percent of participants were guarantee seekers, 31 % were value conscious consumers, and 20 % were spenders. Guarantee seekers preferred guarantees on the cut flower arrangements. Value conscious consumers were interested in both guarantees and longevity indicators. Spenders were the least interested in longevity indicators and guarantees. We conclude floral retailers could use longevity indicators and guarantees to attract consumers, improve consumer confidence, and generate profits. Floral retailers could also develop target marketing strategies to attract different consumer clusters. 	In the minimally <b>processed</b> <b>horticultural</b> products study, an experimental auction and eye-tracking analysis were combined to examine consumer preferences and WTP. Differences were found between production methods, origin, and nutrient content claim content. Consumers' preferences and WTP were product specific. Additionally, there was a correlation between visual attention and consumers' WTP. More fixations on attributes participants' valued resulted in greater WTP. Conversely, more fixations on attributes participants' did not value resulted in a discounted WTP. We conclude producers and industry associations could benefit from exploring the potential of producing products with the attributes commanding greater premiums. Additionally, retailers could benefit from using in-store promotions to improve the visibility of the premium generating attributes...|$|R

Computers, electronics and control engineering {{have become more}} and more powerful tools not only for agricultural engineering research activities but also for a better efficiency in agricultural and <b>horticultural</b> production <b>processes.</b> The symposium was needed for making researchers, university teachers and research students in agricultural engineering in the Scandinavian countries aware of the research frontier within the subject. With the subject is meant not only applications within agriculture but also connected areas such as biotechnology, microbiology, meteorology, ergonomics and so on. The purpose of the symposium was: - to state the present research frontier {{in different parts of the}} research field - to identify needs for further research and development - to find a suitable way for future Scandinavian research and development within the subject. Area The symposium consisted of six sections. Sections I—III dealt with the agricultural production processes. Each of these sections was discussed by speakers from two different viewpoints, namely: - to throw light on the biological demands for, needs for and cinditions of applications of electronics, computers and control engineering - to throw light on the present possibilities to solve the existing problems of applications of computers, electronics and control engineering, state the research frontier and discuss the most probable directions of further research and product development. The fourth section discussed different ergonomical viewpoints connected to the use of electronic equipment in agriculture, while the fifth section concerned about the impact on the management on the farm firm. Both these sections also discussed the need for further research. The sixth section of the symposium was a general discussion. This report has been edited by Bruno Nilsson who also was responsible for the organisation of the symposium.

40|$|Abstract: Strategies {{to reduce}} {{potential}} food safety risks in {{fresh fruit and}} vegetables need to start in the paddock or orchard with the horticulturalist. Although Commonwealth and State food safety legislation is not directed at regulating inside farm gate activities, the market itself is demanding that growers, packers and distributors apply the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) methodology within their quality management systems to prevent, eliminate or reduce the food safety risk to an acceptable level. The identified food safety risks in horticulture include chemical (agricultural chemical residues in produce and soil, cleaning agents etc.), physical contamination (sticks, stones, glass, plant matter etc.) and microbiological (bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites). These three food safety risks have the potential to harm humans. HACCP has made a significant impact in the reduction of foodborne illness relating to the consumption of fresh (and <b>processed)</b> <b>horticultural</b> produce. It has also led to improvements in the consistency and quality of produce. However there is emerging concern that HACCP, particularly when applied at the grower level, is not truly addressing potential excess chemical residue contamination. This paper explores the Codex Alimentarius Commission Guidelines for HACCP and its application in the horticultural industry, focusing on small horticultural enterprises (SHE), in ensuring maximum chemical residue limits are not exceeded...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the CODEX Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) methodology has been actively encouraged if not demanded in Australian horticulture to prevent or eliminate the food safety risk in fresh produce or reduce it to an acceptable level. HACCP has {{had a significant impact}} in the reduction of foodborne illness relating to the consumption of fresh (and <b>processed)</b> <b>horticultural</b> produce and in the management of farm chemical residues. It has also assisted in the management of physical contamination. Although HACCP was designed for food safety purposes, there has been strong support in its application to manage produce quality risk resulting in an improvement in the consistency of quality of fresh fruit and vegetables. There is also strong evidence to suggest that the {{application of}} the method can lead to increasing awareness of new ways to deal with existing problems and improve or widen the scope of operational processes. This paper reviews the principles underpinning the HACCP methodology in the light of data collected during an action research project. It then looks at the way three case study organisations have applied the principles as a problem-solving / risk management technique and extended the process to identify potential improvement opportunities and implement solutions that have had substantial benefit for their businesses. The paper then draws the conclusion that successful implementation of the HACCP method could be a major stimulus for product and process improvement in the horticultural sector...|$|R

30|$|Vermicomposting is a non-thermophilic {{biological}} oxidation {{process in which}} organic material are converted into vermicompost which is a peat like material, exhibiting high porosity, aeration, drainage, water holding capacity and rich microbial activities (Edwards 1998; Atiyeh et al. 2000 b; Arancon et al. 2004 a), through the interactions between earthworms and associated microbes. Vermiculture is a cost-effective tool for environmentally sound waste management (Banu et al. 2001; Asha et al. 2008). Earthworms are the crucial drivers of the process, as they aerate, condition and fragment the substrate and thereby drastically alter the microbial activity and their biodegradation potential (Fracchia et al. 2006; Lazcano et al. 2008). Several enzymes, intestinal mucus and antibiotics in earthworm’s intestinal tract {{play an important role}} in the breakdown of organic macromolecules. Biodegradable organic wastes such as crop residues, municipal, hospital and industrial wastes pose major problems in disposal and treatment. Release of unprocessed animal manures into agricultural fields contaminates ground water causing public health risk. Vermicomposting is the best alternative to conventional composting and differs from it in several ways (Gandhi et al. 1997). Vermicomposting hastens the decomposition process by 2 – 5 times, thereby quickens the conversion of wastes into valuable biofertilizer and produces much more homogenous materials compared to thermophilic composting (Bhatnagar and Palta 1996; Atiyeh et al. 2000 a). Distinct differences exist between the microbial communities found in vermicomposts and composts and hence the nature of the microbial processes is quite different in vermicomposting and composting (Subler et al. 1998). The active phase of composting is the thermophilic stage characterized by thermophilic bacterial community where intensive decomposition takes place followed by a mesophilic maturation phase (Lazcano et al. 2008; Vivas et al. 2009). Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process characterized by mesophilic bacteria and fungi (Benitez et al. 1999). Vermicomposting comprises of an active stage during which earthworms and associated microbes jointly process the substrate and the maturation phase that involves the action of associated microbes and occurs once the worm’s moves to the fresher layers of undigested waste or when the product is removed from the vermireacter. The duration of the active phase depends on the species and density of the earthworms involved (Ndegwa et al. 2000; Lazcano et al. 2008; Aira et al. 2011).
