5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> his time had come.|$|E
5|$|The convention, held on October 1, 1930, {{proved to}} be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald. In a {{departure}} from tradition, the party's new leader would be chosen by convention delegates instead of Liberal caucus members at the legislature. Two veterans of Liberal politics, both wealthy businessmen, were contesting the leadership. There was little enthusiasm, however, for either. Just as nominations were about to close, a delegate from Truro rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald. Surprised, Macdonald at first declined the nomination, then agreed to accept it when <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> strong support on the convention floor. A few hours later, the 40-year-old Macdonald had won a resounding first-ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E
5|$|Soma ascends to the castle's {{keep and}} confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole desire {{is to leave}} the castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.|$|E
25|$|He {{thought it}} was me at first and chatted away quite happily to Dave, whose French was near enough non-existent. Well, {{it was not long}} before <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> {{something}} was wrong and whipped the scarf off the poor lad's face. He stormed over to my cabin and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E

50|$|Farley {{promises}} {{to convince his}} followers that the church needs liberal thinkers who don't always do things by the book. As soon as <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> <b>he</b> is losing support, however, the priest backs down. Dolson angrily confronts him {{with a feeling of}} betrayal, forcing Farley to rethink his position and do the right thing, even if it means the loss of his parish.|$|R
50|$|While roughhousing, {{two boys}} enter {{the parking garage}} where Frost is located with his latest creation, a monster called the White Worm. Frost sics the White Worm on the children, then flees when <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> the {{approach}} of Blade.|$|R
25|$|One {{of the men}} who did {{not turn}} up to the fateful meeting at Greco's estate was Salvatore Contorno. <b>He</b> <b>sensed</b> trouble and soon went into hiding when the Mafia War broke out. He {{narrowly}} escaped death during an ambush by a Corleonesi hitman, Michele's nephew Pino Greco. While in hiding from both the authorities and the Corleonesi, Contorno sent anonymous letters to the police, revealing to the authorities information on the Mafia, its members, the various factions and the violent turmoil it was undergoing. Contorno was eventually arrested in 1983 and became an informant the following year, following Tommaso Buscetta's example.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{worked with}} states outside the European Economic Community (EEC) {{to form the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which from 3 May 1960 {{established}} a free-trade area. Macmillan also saw the value of rapprochement with the EEC, to which his government sought belated entry, but Britain's application was vetoed by French president Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963. De Gaulle was always strongly opposed to British entry for many reasons. <b>He</b> <b>sensed</b> the British were inevitably {{closely linked to the}} Americans. He saw the EEC as a continental arrangement primarily between France and Germany, and if Britain joined, France's role would diminish.|$|E
25|$|On November 28/29, Maj. Gen. D.I. Stankevskii took {{command of}} the division. He would remain in command, apart from one week as acting {{commander}} of 58th Rifle Corps, until nearly the end of 1944. The division took over the bridgehead at Varlamov from 122nd Cavalry, while four to five companies of one regiment seized another bridgehead at Siniapkin, 11km to the south, but this was soon contained. Romanian 1st Armored, at 30 percent strength, moved to block the Varlamov bridgehead, joining the 2nd Battalion of the German 403rd Security Division's 354th Grenadier Regiment. This led the commander of 5th Tank Army, Lt. Gen. P.L. Romanenko, to reinforce the position with the remaining tanks of 8th Guards and 216th Tank Brigades, along with two regiments of 47th Guards Division, as <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> this sector offered the best prospects for a breakout across the Chir. In fighting from November 29 through to December 1, the several Soviet bridgeheads were consolidated, but no breakthrough occurred. At this time, the division likely numbered fewer than 6,000 men.|$|E

25|$|Four {{months after}} Poirot's death, Hastings {{receives}} a manuscript in which Poirot explains all. X was Norton, {{a man who}} had perfected the technique of which Iago in Othello (and a character in Ervine's play) is master: applying just such psychological pressure as is needed to provoke someone to commit murder, without his victim realising what is happening. Norton had demonstrated this ability, with Colonel Luttrell, with Hastings, and Mrs Franklin. Poirot intervened with sleeping pills in Hastings' hot chocolate that night, to avert a disastrous rash action. Ironically, Hastings had unwittingly intervened in Mrs. Franklin's plan to poison her husband, by turning a revolving bookcase table while seeking a book to solve a crossword clue (Othello again), thus swapping the cups of coffee, so Mrs Franklin poisoned herself. Poirot could not prove this. <b>He</b> <b>sensed</b> that Norton, who had been deliberately vague about whom he had seen through the binoculars, would hint that he had seen Franklin and Judith, to implicate them in the murder of Mrs Franklin, not inadvertent suicide as it was. This explains Poirot's testimony at her inquest, to ensure the police would stop their investigation.|$|E
500|$|Fontaine later stated at a {{news conference}} that, at the meeting, <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> the Pope's [...] "pain and anguish" [...] and that the {{acknowledgement}} was [...] "important to [...] and that was what [...] was looking for".|$|E
500|$|Canavan {{later wrote}} that Southard had {{experienced}} [...] "singular difficulties producing considerable mental discomfort" [...] {{during the last}} year of his life.

Canavan quoted him as saying, [...] "I shall not live long, I must hurry; I must get lots of others busy." ...|$|E

500|$|When <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> that [...] piece {{needed an}} {{introduction}} or an ending, {{a new direction}} or fresh material, he would call for a space chord, a collectively improvised tone cluster at high volume which [...] "would suggest a new melody, maybe a rhythm."

500|$|When Luan Da returned, he {{told the}} emperor of his falsified meeting with the immortals; however, <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> that the emperor did not believe him. Before long, the emperor broke out in a rage, {{ordering}} Luan Da to tell what he had actually done. Dumbfounded, Luan Da attempted to continue his lies; however, the emperor called for the spy to come forth and expose the lies. [...] Lost for words, Luan Da was arrested on Emperor Wu's order, and executed by having his body chopped into two at the waist. [...] The emperor extended his fury to the Marquess of Lecheng for introducing Luan Da, having him beheaded and his body then defiled.|$|E
500|$|Cavallo {{was chosen}} as the main {{producer}} of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> that [...] " [...] had stumbled on something big." [...] The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, [...] "similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." [...] The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, [...] "Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it." ...|$|E
50|$|It is his curse {{that he has}} {{a strong}} desire to make dreams come true, but does not have any dreams himself. He seeks out other beings that <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> have wishes <b>he</b> can fulfill. Only in this way can he find a release for his strong desire to shape reality.|$|R

500|$|Henry [...] "Hack" [...] Scudder is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams wearing a tuxedo. Scudder is {{mentioned}} {{several times in}} the first season, revealing he once worked at the carnival's geek show and was Ruthie's lover. Scudder also had a relationship with Ben's mother once; Samson later confirms Scudder as Ben's father. Season 2 forces both Ben and Brother Justin to find Scudder for their own purposes. It is confirmed that he is the previous generation's Creature of Darkness, and just as Management, the previous Avatar of Light, knew Ben's identity, he knows Brother Justin's, the current Avatar of Darkness. [...] He had repeatedly tried to flee from his destiny, and when <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> Management approaching he fled to protect Ben and his mother. After a long journey, Ben finds Scudder in Damascus, Nebraska and brings him to the carnival's Management and reveals that Management's son is the Avatar of Darkness. Management attacks Scudder, leading to Ben killing Management to protect him. Scudder flees and moments later, escaped convict Stroud kidnaps him and brings him to Brother Justin. Brother Justin anticipates Scudder's renewed escape and decapitates him.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's {{friends were}} {{generally}} {{enthusiastic about the}} book. Anthony Powell {{thought that it was}} one of Waugh's most interesting works, and Graham Greene placed it among the writer's best fiction. The Donaldsons thought that he had [...] "succeeded wonderfully" [...] in providing so vivid an account of his experiences. John Betjeman, reviewing the book for The Daily Telegraph, wrote: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold is self-examination written as a novel, but unlike other such works, which are generally dreary and self-pitying, this, because it is by Mr Waugh, is readable, thrilling and detached". Other reviewers were generally more circumspect. Philip Toynbee in The Observer found it [...] "very hard to say whether it is a good book or not; it is certainly an interesting and a moving one". <b>He</b> <b>sensed</b> in Waugh's writing a [...] "change of gear", a point picked up by John Raymond in the New Statesman. Raymond thought Waugh was the only current English novelist whose work showed signs of development, and that in Pinfold had produced [...] "one of his wittiest, most humane entertainments", a work of self-revelation only marred, in Raymond's view, by an unsatisfactory conclusion. The Times Literary Supplements reviewer R.G.G. Price deemed it a [...] "thin little tale", while acknowledging that Waugh as a comic writer could reasonably be compared with P.G. Wodehouse in terms of originality and humour.|$|E
