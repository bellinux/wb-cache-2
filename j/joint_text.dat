40|$|In {{their joint}} {{statement}} on the Europe 2020 strategy, the European social partners insist {{on the need to}} include social partners at all levels (European, national, regional and local levels) in the design and monitoring of the reforms in order to guarantee the success of the post Lisbon strategy. At the time of the Lisbon strategy, the social partners were involved in the achievement of the objectives through variable ways. However, it seems that the weight of the social partners on the process was rather limited (Baradel & Welz 2005, de la Porte & Pochet 2003, 2004, Léonard 2005, Gold 2007). In this communication, we will study the specific case of the European sectoral social dialogue (ESSD). Despite many critics (Branch 2005, de Boer et al. 2005, Keller 2003), it seems ESSD has potential to respond to the challenges raised by European integration to the social market economy. Until now, more than 500 <b>joint</b> <b>texts</b> have been adopted by the sectoral committees and 40 sectors have formed an ESSD committee (European Commission 2010). However, this dynamic is undermined by the lack of knowledge the European social partners have about the effective implementation of their <b>joint</b> <b>texts</b> within the national contexts. Those texts are non binding and the European social partners have no means to constrain their affiliates to follow their recommendations. This weakness raises the issue of the legitimacy and the ability of the social partners to handle European issues and {{to be involved in the}} creation of a European social model. Our objective is here to highlight the mechanisms that could favour the implementation of the <b>joint</b> <b>texts</b> within the EU member states and then enable the European social partners to be involved and to weight on the post-Lisbon strategy...|$|R

40|$|European social {{dialogue}} refers, at the strict {{sense of the}} term, to bilateral negotiations between European trade unions and employers’ federations. Social dialogue committees are organized at the cross-sectoral level {{as well as at}} the sectoral level. Currently, 40 professional sectors such as agriculture, chemical industry or telecommunications, have created a {{social dialogue}} committee. If social dialogue committees were at first mainly consultative bodies, in the 1990 ’s European social partners were encouraged to develop bilateral relations and to sign <b>joint</b> <b>texts.</b> In terms of outcomes, 70 <b>joint</b> <b>texts</b> were issued by the cross-sectoral organisations and more than 500 texts at the sectoral level (European Commission 2010). If social partners have the possibility to transform their text in Council decisions such as Directives, most part of the texts consist in process-oriented texts such as frameworks of actions, guidelines or joint opinions (Degryse & Pochet 2011, European Commission 2004). National transposition rely thus on voluntary processes that are largely dependent on the national social partners goodwill and capabilities (Pochet et al. 2009). Because of the non-binding character of the texts, questions about the legitimacy and the efficiency of the European social dialogue were raised (Keller 2008). For now, there is no systematic evaluation of the implementation and the European social partners themselves meet difficulties to receive information about it. Yet, to understand the implementation process better is crucial because it raises the possibility of a European coordination and eventually the construction of a social Europe. In this communication, from an empirical research comparing two sectors and ten countries, we will highlight the mechanisms and the conditions that could favor an effective transposition of the <b>joint</b> <b>texts</b> within the EU member States. Through Europeanisation and multi-level governance approaches, we show that by exploring the actors’ games and their actions and interactions on the national level and on the European level, we can seize the Europeanisation process at stake. Consequently, implementation seems to be linked to the mobilisation of the national social partners in the European social dialogue committees as well as the constraints and the opportunities of their national context...|$|R

40|$|In {{multimedia}} applications, {{the text}} and image components in a web document form a pairwise constraint that potentially indicates the same semantic concept. This paper studies cross-modal learning via the pairwise constraint, and aims to find the common structure hidden in different modalities. We first propose a compound regularization framework {{to deal with the}} pairwise constraint, which {{can be used as a}} general platform for developing cross-modal algorithms. For unsupervised learning, we propose a cross-modal subspace clustering method to learn a common structure for different modalities. For supervised learning, to reduce the semantic gap and the outliers in pairwise constraints, we propose a cross-modal matching method based on compound ? 21 regularization along with an iteratively reweighted algorithm to find the global optimum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of <b>joint</b> <b>text</b> and image modeling with semantically induced pairwise constraints, and show that the proposed cross-modal methods can further reduce the semantic gap between different modalities and improve the clustering/retrieval accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of script {{identification}} in unconstrained scenarios. Script identification is an important prerequisite to recognition, and an indispensable condition for automatic text understanding systems designed for multi-language environments. Although widely studied for document images and handwritten documents, it remains an almost unexplored territory for scene text images. We detail a novel method for script identification in natural images that combines convolutional features and the Naive-Bayes Nearest Neighbor classifier. The proposed framework efficiently exploits the discriminative power of small stroke-parts, in a fine-grained classification framework. In addition, we propose a new public benchmark dataset for the evaluation of <b>joint</b> <b>text</b> detection and script identification in natural scenes. Experiments done in this new dataset demonstrate that the proposed method yields state of the art results, while it generalizes well to different datasets and variable number of scripts. The evidence provided shows that multi-lingual scene text recognition in the wild is a viable proposition. Source code of the proposed method is made available online...|$|E

The research instruments were students observation guide, field note guide, and writing assessment guide. The data were qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative data were obtained from the results of classroom observation and field notes, and the quantitative data were the students’ pretest scores, scores in the independent construction of text in each cycle, and posttest scores. The reliability of the data was obtained by using the triangulation technique which combined the result of the observation, field note, and the result of the students’ writing. The result of the research shows that the improvement was achieved in every cycle. At the building knowledge of the field phase, the students competence in expressing vocabulary improved, at modeling of text phase, the students were able to understand the teachers’ explanation about genre, at the <b>joint</b> construction of <b>text</b> phase, the students were able to interact with their peers, and at the independent construction of text phase, the students were able to compose a text without the teacher’s guide and friends’ help.
