25|$|In one {{instance}} of DRM {{that caused a}} rift with consumers, Amazon.com in July 2009, remotely deleted purchased copies of George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) from customers' Amazon Kindles after providing them a refund for the purchased products. Commentors have described these actions as Orwellian and have compared Amazon to Big Brother from Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. After Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos issued a public apology, the Free Software Foundation wrote {{that this was just}} one more example of the excessive power Amazon has to remotely censor what people read through its software, and called upon Amazon to free its <b>e-book</b> <b>reader</b> and drop DRM. Amazon then revealed the reason behind its deletion: the e-books in question were unauthorized reproductions of Orwell's works, which were not within the public domain and to which the company that published and sold them on Amazon's service had no rights.|$|E

40|$|As {{electronic}} book (<b>e-book)</b> <b>readers</b> are increasingly applied in educational contexts, {{it is becoming}} imperative to explore issues of how to integrate these new reading devices with pedagogical principles. To achieve this goal, this study proposes a participatory learning framework to design reading activities with <b>e-book</b> <b>readers.</b> Such a framework addresses the integration of individual reading, collaborative learning and a learner community, and highlights the role of parents in assisting children to engage in reading communities. An evaluation found that <b>e-book</b> <b>readers</b> are helpful in this framework in facilitating parent-child interaction. The findings also show that the collaborative storytelling activity on the <b>e-book</b> <b>readers</b> may afford {{a variety of forms}} of interaction. Three major parent-child interaction patterns were also found. Each pattern facilitated the parents to apply certain types of dialogic reading strategies. Further discussion of the findings with regard to parent-child reading and its educational implications is included...|$|R

40|$|The {{predictors}} of innovative consumer electronics product acceptance range from technology to economic factors. Prior studies assume direct effects from these predictors on acceptance behavior. We study <b>e-book</b> <b>readers</b> as an illustrative technology. We contend that consumers’ perceived innovative attributes (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) directly affect their acceptance behavior, and also influence their behavior via {{their perception of}} the costs (procedural, financial, and relational switching costs). Our findings reveal that complexity is a key antecedent to switching costs. The empirical results also suggest the full or partial mediating role of procedural and relational switching costs between the innovative attributes and the use of <b>e-book</b> <b>readers.</b> Financial switching costs, however, are not influential for the use of <b>e-book</b> <b>readers...</b>|$|R
