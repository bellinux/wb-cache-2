40|$|The {{communities}} of bark-dwelling spiders and <b>false</b> <b>scorpions</b> on standing trunks {{of living and}} dead oaks (Quercus robur) of various stages were studied in an ancient woodland in the lowland of NW-Germany. The investigations were carried out from march to october 1996 by use of 28 emergencs traps. For comparative purpose one stem-eclector was used. All traps were installed at a height of 2 meters. The appropriateness of these methods for collecting spiders is discussed. A total of 1828 spiders (41 species) and 57 <b>false</b> <b>scorpions</b> (1 species) were encountered. Abundance gradients are analysed with regard to bark-structure, insolation and age of dead wood. Three species are first recorded in the NW-German Plan: Dipoena torva, Haplodrassus cognatus and Synema globosum. Hitherto the predominant spieders Thyreosthenius parasiticus and Haplodrassus cognatus have not been found on bark abundantly. Thus, {{the structure of the}} bark-dwelling fauna varies considerably with region, biotope structure and historical aspects. The occurence of Dendrochernes cymeus, which in Britain is associtated with ancient woodlands, indicates that this species could be restricted to such woodlands in Northern Germany, too...|$|R

40|$|A new eyeless troglobitic pseudoscorpion, Ayyalonia dimentmani n. g., n. sp., is {{described}} from inside karstic voids in Israel that form a completely isolated, old underground ecosystem with living populations of blind pseudoscorpions, crustaceans, collembolans, thysanurans and mites. The scorpions, of which only empty carcasses {{have been found}} may represent extinct derives or recently dead specimens belonging to an unknown population existing somewhere in the Ayyalon underground spaces. The pseudoscorpions analyzed prove to differ from all other pseudoscorpions and are placed in a new tribe, new genus, and a new species. The possibility is suggested that the subterranean <b>false</b> <b>scorpions</b> are relicts of an old circum-tropical pattern of distribution (either of early Miocene or late Mesozoic age and origin) that differs from the present Mediterranean location of Israel...|$|R

This endemic form is illustrated, diagnosed, and thoroughly compared to its phenetically closest congener [C. (C.) porevidi Ćurčić, Makarov & Lučić, 1998] from the area of Krivošije in Montenegro.

40|$|I. The {{histology}} of the mid-gut of Dactylochelifer latreilli (Leach) is described. The mid-gut {{is divided}} into two regions: an anterior diverticular region consisting of digestive cells, excretory cells, and small basal cells of unknown function, and a narrow, posterior post-diverticular region possessing a syncytial epithelium. The whole mid-gut is invested in a layer of peritoneal cells. 2. The changes in the staining reaction of protein globules undergoing intra-cellular digestion are followed. 3. The development of excretory cells is described. The function of the post-diverticular mid-gut in the excretory process is outlined. 4. Storage of fatty material and glycogen occurs in the digestive cells and in the peritoneal epithelium. 5. The structure and functions of the <b>false</b> <b>scorpion</b> mid-gut are compared with those of other Arachnids...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a long term survey on the effects of grazing on the {{diversity}} of alpine grasslands, the <b>false</b> <b>scorpion</b> Chthonius (Ephippiochthonius) poeninus Mahnert, 1979 was recorded for the first time outside of Switzerland. The preferred habitat at the locality Alpe Einödsberg (Germany, Bavaria) differs strongly from previous findings. Our data suggest an association with Nardus grasslands (Geo montani-Nardetum), whereas earlier records originated from leaf litter, moss and mouldy trunks. Furthermore, the new records between 1540 m and 1973 m above sea level are the first from the subalpine region of the Alps (hitherto C. poeninus was known from 550 m to 1450 m). In the study region, extensive grazing seems to {{have a positive effect on}} the abundance of the species, while it is missing from intensively grazed pastures...|$|E
40|$|Roncus (Parablothrus) pljakici, a {{new species}} of cave living pseudoscorpions, is {{described}} from the cave ‘Pecina u selu Vrelo’ on Mt. Stara Planina, East Serbia. The problem of its taxonomic position in the subgenus is discussed. The new species is the first representative of Parablothrus {{to be found in}} Serbia. It seems possible that R. (P.) pljakici represents an endemic species, specialized for a cavernicolous way of living. The analogies of this and other species of the subgenus point to some similar phenomena which occur in other genera of Balkan <b>false</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Ćurčić 1972). In all these cases, a close relationship among the species inhabiting East Serbia, Macedonia and Herzegovina was noticed. It is probable, therefore, that the three regions represent the autochthonous areas of the original populations of the analysed groups of species, out of which new species came into existence...|$|R
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of May 2005 to September 2007 the pseudoscorpion fauna in a hardwood floodplain forest of the Rhine valley near Ingelheim was investigated. Altogether 587 individuals representing two species from two families were captured using pitfall traps, trunk eclectors and by litter sieving. The warm, dry winter 2006 / 2007 exhibited a strong influence upon the activity of Neobisium carcinoides (Hermann, 1804). This winter event was followed by an extreme drought in April 2007, which affected the activity maximum of the corticolous species Chernes hahnii (C. L. Koch, 1839). In 2005 and 2006 the activity maximum of C. hahnii was observed in July, whereas in 2007 maturity was achieved earlier in May. Furthermore 31 individuals of N. carcinoides were captured in trunk eclectors. This climbing behaviour correlates {{with the presence of}} Lepidocyrtus lignorum (Collembola: Entomobryidae) on the trunks.

40|$|The {{determinants}} of sexual dimorphism {{in a family}} of <b>false</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Pseudoscorpionida, Chernetidae) were investigated experimentally and with a literature analysis of comparative morphometric and habitat data. Species vary in the extent to which males and females differ in size of the conspicuous, prehensile pedipalps. Patterns within the Chernetidae suggest that dimorphism is a highly variable condition, relatively unconstrained by phylogenetic influences. The evolution of species with enlarged male pedipalps appears to be associated with a change from nonpairing to pairing sperm transfer behavior, and aggressive mate acquisition by males. Experiments with Dinocheirus arizonensis demonstrate a high correlation between male combat ability and chela size. Comparison of male and female life histories show prolonged development in males, and morphological comparisons implicate pedipalp dimorphism as a causative factor in this developmental rate difference. Prolonged development may be particularly costly to males, given the pattern of female sexual receptivity in this species. Females were found to become unreceptive soon after mating and remain so throughout a protected period of brood development. Experimental manipulations suggest that the male developmental rate cost is only outweighed under high density conditions when superior combat ability results in increased mating success. Repeated measures experiments failed to show any correlation between male pedipalp size and number of spermatophores accepted by a female. Parent-offspring regressions suggest the existence of additive genetic variance for male chela size and indicate a strong genetic correlation between this trait and cephalothorax length. Full-sib phenotypic correlations suggest that in D. arizonensis sexual divergence through sexual selection may be constrained by a high genetic correlation between males and females. Finally, the role of phoresy in the colonization of ephemeral, patchy habitats is investigated. Results support the hypothesis that attachment of pseudoscorpions to larger, more mobile arthropods represents a behavior functioning specifically for dispersal...|$|R
