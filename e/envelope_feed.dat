40|$|The Wasp-Waist Nebula was {{discovered}} in the IRAC c 2 d survey of the Ophiuchus starforming clouds. It {{is powered by a}} well-isolated, low-luminosity, low-mass Class 0 object. Its weak outflow has been mapped in the CO (3 - 2) transition with the JCMT, in 2. 12 micron H 2 emission with WIRC (the Wide-Field Infrared Camera) on the Hale 5 -meter, and, most recently, in six H 2 mid-infrared lines with the IRS (InfraRed Spectrograph) on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope; possible jet twisting structure may be evidence of unique core dynamics. Here, we report results of recent VLA ammonia mapping observations of the dense gas <b>envelope</b> <b>feeding</b> the central core protostellar system.

40|$|The Phase 1 {{privatization}} contract (DOE-RL 1996) {{requires that}} the Project Hanford Management Contractors, {{on behalf of the}} U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, deliver waste feed in appropriate quantities and composition on schedule. The Feed Process Management Team (FPMT) was created with responsibility for establishing requirements, identifying and recommending baseline change control, assuring configuration management of tank contents (e. g., feed pedigrees), and requiring understanding among the various TWRS elements so the right feed is produced on schedule (Boston 1996). The FPMT has charged the Double Shell Tank (DST) Waste Inventory Control (WIC) (LMHC 1997) group to develop and implement the waste configuration control needed to insure that our ability to deliver feed on schedule is not adversely impacted. The WIC group, which has representatives from engineering, environmental, operations, and waste feed delivery, reviews proposed waste transfers and technical issues affecting the TWRS waste inventory. The WIC group either approves proposed transfers or, if a unanimous decision is not obtained, elevates approval to the FPMT. A representative from the FPMT is present at the WIC group meetings where waste transfer approvals are decided, and WIC relays information to the FPMT as needed. The TWRS operations include waste inventory control, waste consolidation, waste transfers, compatibility evaluations, feed staging for privatization, and technical issues affecting waste transfers. Pumping restrictions are outlined in Boston (1998). The mobilization, retrieval, transfer, pretreatment, staging, and delivery of feed to the privatization contractor take place in the DST system. These tanks support multiple programs; therefore, the tank space must be allocated and controlled so as not to interfere with the delivery of feed by creating space bottlenecks or by significantly changing the composition or quantity of feed. Each feed tank selected for Phase 1 processing has been identified as a source of waste for a particular <b>feed</b> <b>envelope.</b> These <b>feed</b> <b>envelope</b> descriptions are identified in the Phase 1 privatization contract...|$|R
25|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Miragaia is its long neck, which was {{composed}} of at least seventeen vertebrae. According to the authors, this represents {{the culmination of a}} trend towards longer necks seen in stegosaurians. The Thyreophora, the larger group they belong to, originally seem to have had nine neck vertebrae and this is also the number shown by the basal stegosaurian Huayangosaurus. Later forms like Stegosaurus or Hesperosaurus had twelve or thirteen. This is the more remarkable that Miragaia had more neck vertebrae than most sauropods, a different group of dinosaurs and one that is famous for its long necks, which contrasts with the traditional view of stegosaurians as low browsers with short necks. Only the Chinese sauropods Euhelopus, Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus had as many neck vertebrae as Miragaia, with most sauropods of the Late Jurassic possessing only twelve to fifteen. Mateus and colleagues suggested that the long neck either allowed Miragaia to browse at a level that other herbivores were not exploiting, or that the neck arose due to sexual selection. The possible food gathering function of the neck makes sexual selection a less plausible explanation, but is not in itself entirely convincing: though the contemporary Iberian sauropods Lusotitan, Dinheirosaurus and Turiasaurus were all very large and might not have competed with a medium-height browser, the niche partitioning is still problematic because in Iberia stegosaurian remains have been referred to Dacentrurus and Stegosaurus, which would have possessed a <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope</b> or <b>feeding</b> height stratification overlapping that of Miragaia.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{grinding}} {{the revolving}} curved surface with Arc Envelope Grinding Method, the different curvatures in the convex and concave surfaces {{make a great}} difference in the surface roughness. In order {{to solve this problem}}, the relationship among <b>envelope</b> height, <b>feeding</b> rate, rotational speed and curvature of workpiece was analyzed based on equal-envelope-height grinding method. The results presented that, low feeding rate of grinding wheel and high rotational speed of workpiece were helpful to obtain smaller envelope height. And the smaller the radius of workpiece curvature, the more different the surface roughness. Besides, it was an effective method to solve this problem by changing feeding rate. The feeding rate should be changed directly proportionally to radius of workpiece curvature. Then, the experimental results indicate that, the fluctuation ratio of surface roughness with variable feeding rate is reduced to 4. 896 % from 26. 17 % with constant feeding rate. It proves the validity of hypothesis...|$|R
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope</b> and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|R
40|$|The Sauropoda {{were the}} largest {{terrestrial}} animals {{ever to have}} lived on this planet. As their nutritional requirements were so huge, their diet holds sway over the ecology of many Mesozoic herbivores. The diet of the sauropods is limited by their <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope,</b> {{which in turn is}} governed by the posture and flexibility of their elongate necks. Yet the exact nature of the flexibility and posture of the neck has been a contentious issue. Previous studies have utilised computer models of dry bone, mechanical principles or the flexibility of the necks of extant animals. However, the effect of the musculature of the neck has yet to be investigated. Through measurements of the flexibility of the ostrich neck after cumulative tissue removal, analyses of the muscle attachment sites of the ostrich and sauropods, and testing of the Osteological Neutral Pose model, this study attempts to rectify this situation. The ostrich neck was shown to have three sections of flexibility; a slightly flexible anterior section, a very flexible middle section and a stiff posterior section. The Osteological Neutral Pose did not show these sections, and was shown to potentially overestimate and underestimate flexibility. It was also found that the inter-vertebral space could account for varying estimates of flexibility, and that sauropods would have proportionally more muscle mass {{at the base of the}} neck in relation to the ostrich. Ultimately, it was shown that the tissues of the neck place the limits of flexibility, and that zygapophyseal overlap does not indicate the flexibility of the neck. Should the Osteological Neutral Pose affect sauropod flexibility estimates in the same manner as that of the ostrich (a general overestimate), then the sauropods would have a more limited <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope</b> than previously thought, allowing for greater niche partitioning between groups.

40|$|We apply joint-probability {{analysis}} {{to evaluate the}} probabilities of interactions between pelagic longline gear (PLL) and pilot whales. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) Investigate how pilot whales and Risso’s dolphins are interacting with pelagic longline gear during fishing and haulback; and (2) Characterize pilot whales’ and/or Risso’s dolphins’ social structure/behavior and/or habitat utilization in the Mid-Atlantic Bight region and how it may influence interactions with pelagic longline gear. Interaction probabilities were created using varying temporal and spatial parameters along with detailed gear information. From 2010 to 2012, temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on commercial PLL gear (n= 23, average soak duration 6 hours) and digital acoustic tags (DTags) were deployed on pilot whales (n= 8, average tag duration 8 hours). TDR records were used to generate probabilities of gear depths at varying times and DTag records were used to create both habitat utilization <b>envelopes</b> and <b>feeding</b> probabilities varying across depths and times. The combination of these fine-scale pilot whale data (DTag and echolocation) and PLL gear depth distribution were used to evaluate the probabilities of interactions between PLL gear and pilot whales at varying temporal and horizontal-vertical spatial scales, as well as different feeding motivations. By creating a standard exportable methodology for assessing interaction probability bycatch reduction methodologies can be applied to specifically identified and thus targeted areas of high interaction probabilities...|$|R
40|$|The `Preliminary Low-Level Waste Feed Staging Plan` was updated {{to reflect}} the latest {{requirement}} in the Tank Waste Remediation Privatization Request for Proposals (RFP) and amendments. The updated plan develops the sequence and transfer schedule for retrieval of DST supernate by the management and integration contractor and delivery of the staged supernate to the private low-activity waste contractors for treatment. Two DSTs are allocated as intermediate staging tanks. A transfer system conflict analysis provides part of the basis for determining transfer system upgrade requirements to support both low-activity and high-level waste feed delivery. The intermediate staging tank architecture and retrieval system equipment are provided as a planning basis until design requirements documents are prepared. The actions needed to successfully implement the plan are identified.

In sauropods, great neck length was achieved by a combination of three processes: incorporation of back vertebrae into the neck; addition of new vertebrae; and lengthening of the individual neck vertebrae. The authors considered whether these mechanisms might have been paralleled in stegosaurians. The long neck of Miragaia appears to have resulted mostly from back vertebrae becoming incorporated into the neck, based on vertebral counts of other stegosaurians. In this group the total number of prescral vertebrae, of the back and neck combined, hardly increased, but there is a clear transformation, dorsal vertebrae of the back becoming [...] "cervicalised" [...] into cervical vertebrae of the neck. Whereas Huayangosaurus still possessed sixteen back vertebrae, this number was reduced to thirteen in Hesperosaurus. There is currently — no count of the number of dorsal vertebrae being possible — no evidence that with Miragaia new vertebrae contributed to the neck; instead, the distribution of existing vertebrae in the back and neck probably changed, about four extra vertebrae becoming cervicals. There is some evidence for increasing vertebral length in Miragaia and Stegosaurus, compared to more basal species, but this is equivocal and could be due to post-mortem distortion; this mechanism was seen as a minor factor in neck elongation.|$|R
40|$|The {{brightest}} ultraluminous X-ray source currently known, HLX- 1, {{has been}} observed to undergo five outburst cycles. The periodicity of these outbursts, and their high inferred maximum accretion rates of ∼ few× 10 ^- 4 M_ yr^- 1, naturally suggest Roche lobe overflow at the pericenter of an eccentric orbit. It is, however, difficult for the Roche lobe overflow model to explain the apparent trend of decreasing decay times over the different outbursts while the integrated luminosity also drops. Thus if the trend is real rather than simply being {{a reflection of the}} complex physics of accretion disks, a different scenario may be necessary. We present a speculative model in which, within the last decade, a high-mass giant star had most of its envelope tidally stripped by the ∼ 10 ^ 4 - 5 M_ black hole in HLX- 1, and the remaining core plus low-mass hydrogen <b>envelope</b> now <b>feeds</b> the hole with a strong wind. This model can explain the short decay time of the disk, and could explain the fast decrease in decay time if the wind speed increases with time. A key prediction of this model {{is that there will be}} excess line absorption due to the wind; our analysis does in fact find a flux deficit in the ∼ 0. 9 - 1. 1 keV range that is consistent with predictions, albeit at low significance. If this idea is correct, we also expect that within tens of years the bound material from the original disruption will return and will make HLX- 1 a persistently bright source.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the DM 100 and DM 10 tests were to determine the impact of four different organics and one inorganic feed additive on sulfate volatilization and to determine the sulfur partitioning between the glass and the off-gas system. The tests provided information on melter processing characteristics and off-gas data including sulfur incorporation and partitioning. A series of DM 10 and DM 100 melter tests were conducted using a LAW <b>Envelope</b> A <b>feed.</b> The testing was divided into three parts. The first part involved a series of DM 10 melter tests with four different organic feed additives: sugar, polyethylene glycol (PEG), starch, and urea. The second part involved two confirmatory 50 -hour melter tests on the DM 100 using the best combination of reductants and conditions based on the DM 10 results. The third part {{was performed on the}} DM 100 with feeds containing vanadium oxide (V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }) as an inorganic additive to increase sulfur partitioning to the off-gas. Although vanadium oxide is not a reductant, previous testing has shown that vanadium shows promise for partitioning sulfur to the melter exhaust, presumably through its known catalytic effect on the SO{sub 2 }/SO{sub 3 } reaction. Crucible-scale tests were conducted prior to the melter tests to confirm that the glasses and feeds would be processable in the melter and that the glasses would meet the waste form (ILAW) performance requirements.

40|$|The recent arms {{reduction}} treaties between the U. S. and Russia {{have resulted in}} inventories of plutonium in excess of current defense needs. Storage of this material poses significant, and unnecessary, risks of diversion, especially for Russia whose infrastructure for protecting these materials has been weakened {{since the collapse of}} the Soviet Union. Moreover, maintaining and protecting these materials in their current form is costly. The United States has about sixty metric tons of excess plutonium, half of which is high-purity weapon material. This high purity material will be converted into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for use in nuclear reactors. The less pure excess plutonium does not meet the specifications for MOX fuel and will not be purified to meet the fuel specifications. Instead, it will be immobilized directly in a ceramic. The ceramic will be encased in a high level waste (HLW) glass monolith (i. e., the can-in-canister option) thus making a form that simulates the intrinsic security of spent nuclear fuel. The immobilized product will be placed in a HLW repository. To meet the repository requirements, the product must be shown to be durable for the intended storage time, the host matrix must be stable in the radiation environment, the solubility and leaching characteristics of the plutonium in the host material must be established, and optimum processing parameters must be determined for the entire compositional <b>envelope</b> of <b>feed</b> materials. In order to provide technically sound solutions to these issues, thermodynamic data are essential in developing an understanding of the chemistry and phase equilibria of the actinide-bearing mineral waste forms proposed as immobilization matrices. However, the relevant thermodynamic data (e. g., enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity) for the ceramic forms are severely lacking and this information gap directly affects the Energy Department's ability to license the disposal matrices and methods. High-temperature solution calorimetry {{is one of the most}} powerful techniques, sometimes the only technique, for providing the fundamental thermodynamic data needed to establish optimum material fabrication parameters, and more importantly, understand and predict the behavior of the mineral materials in the environment.

40|$|The colossal {{size and}} body plan of sauropod dinosaurs are unparalleled in {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. However, to-date {{there have been}} only limited attempts to examine temporal and phylogenetic patterns in the sauropod bauplan. Here we combine three-dimensional computational models with phylogenetic reconstructions to quantify the evolution of whole-body shape and body segment properties across the sauropod radiation. Limitations associated with the absence of soft tissue preservation in fossils result in large error bars about mean absolute body shape predictions. However, applying any consistent skeleton:body volume ratio to all taxa does yield changes in body shape that appear concurrent with major macroevolutionary events in sauropod history. A caudad shift in centre-of-mass in Middle Triassic Saurischia, associated with the evolution of bipedalism in various dinosaur lineages, was reversed in Late Triassic sauropodomorphs. A craniad centre-of-mass shift coincided with the evolution of quadrupedalism in the Late Triassic, followed by a more striking craniad shift in Late Jurassic–Cretaceous titanosauriforms, which included the largest sauropods. These craniad CoM shifts are strongly correlated with neck enlargement, a key innovation in sauropod evolution and pivotal to their gigantism. By creating a much larger <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope,</b> neck elongation is thought to have increased feeding efficiency and opened up trophic niches that were inaccessible to other herbivores. However, we find that relative neck size and center-of-mass position are not strongly correlated with inferred feeding habits.

For planning purposes, waste feed tanks are being divided into five classes in accordance with the type of waste in each tank and the activities required to retrieve, qualify, and transfer waste feed. This report reflects the baseline design and operating concept, as of the beginning of Fiscal Year 2000, for the delivery of feed from three of these classes, represented by source tanks 241 -AN- 102, 241 -AZ- 101 and 241 -AN- 105. The preliminary RAM analysis quantifies the potential schedule delay associated with operations and maintenance (OBM) field activities needed to accomplish these operations. The RAM analysis is preliminary because the system design, process definition, and activity planning {{are in a state of}} evolution. The results are being used to support the continuing development of an O&M Concept tailored to the unique requirements of the WFD Program, which is being documented in various volumes of the Waste Feed Delivery Technical Basis (Carlson. 1999, Rasmussen 1999, and Orme 2000).

40|$|The herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods {{were the}} largest {{terrestrial}} animals ever, surpassing the largest herbivorous mammals by {{an order of}} magnitude in body mass. Several evolutionary lineages among Sauropoda produced giants with body masses in excess of 50 metric tonnes by conservative estimates. With body mass increase driven by the selective advantages of large body size, animal lineages will increase in body size until they reach the limit determined by the interplay of bauplan, biology, and resource availability. There is no evidence, however, that resource availability and global physicochemical parameters were different enough in the Mesozoic to have led to sauropod gigantism. We review the biology of sauropod dinosaurs in detail and posit that sauropod gigantism was made possible by a specific combination of plesiomorphic characters (phylogenetic heritage) and evolutionary innovations at different levels which triggered a remarkable evolutionary cascade. Of these key innovations, the most important probably was the very long neck, the most conspicuous feature of the sauropod bauplan. Compared to other herbivores, the long neck allowed more efficient food uptake than in other large herbivores by covering a much larger <b>feeding</b> <b>envelope</b> and making food accessible that was {{out of the reach of}} other herbivores. Sauropods thus must have been able to take up more energy from their environment than other herbivores. The long neck, in turn, could only evolve because of the small head and the extensive pneumatization of the sauropod axial skeleton, lightening the neck. The small head was possible because food was ingested without mastication. Both mastication and a gastric mill would have limited food uptake rate. Scaling relationships between gastrointestinal tract size and basal metabolic rate (BMR) suggest that sauropods compensated for the lack of particle reduction with long retention times, even at high uptake rates. The extensive pneumatization of the axial skeleton resulted from the evolution of an avian-style respiratory system, presumably at the base of Saurischia. An avian-style respiratory system would also have lowered the cost of breathing, reduced specific gravity, and may have been important in removing excess body heat. Another crucial innovation inherited from basal dinosaurs was a high BMR. This is required for fueling the high growth rate necessary for a multi-tonne animal to survive to reproductive maturity. The retention of the plesiomorphic oviparous mode of reproduction appears to have been critical as well, allowing much faster population recovery than in megaherbivore mammals. Sauropods produced numerous but small offspring each season while land mammals show a negative correlation of reproductive output to body size. This permitted lower population densities in sauropods than in megaherbivore mammals but larger individuals. Our work on sauropod dinosaurs thus informs us about evolutionary limits to body size in other groups of herbivorous terrestrial tetrapods. Ectothermic reptiles are strongly limited by their low BMR, remaining small. Mammals are limited by their extensive mastication and their vivipary, while ornithsichian dinosaurs were only limited by their extensive mastication, having greater average body sizes than mammals...|$|R
