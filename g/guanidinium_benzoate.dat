The title compound, CH 6 N 3 +C 7 H 4 NO 4, an {{anhydrous}} guanidinium salt, shows a N—H O hydrogen-bond {{network in}} which the guanidinium cation is involved in three cyclic R 2 1 (6) hydrogen-bonding associations with separate carboxyl-ate O-atom acceptors. Further peripheral associations include a cyclic R 1 2 (4) cation–anion interaction, forming interlinked undulating sheets in the three-dimensional structure.

40|$|In {{the title}} compound, CH 6 N 3 +·C 7 H 6 NO 2 −, the cation and anion lie on crystallographic mirror planes. The 4 -amino­benzoate anion is {{almost in a}} planar {{conformation}} with a maximum deviation of 0. 024  (2)  Å for the N atom. The bond length in the deprotonated carboxyl group is inter­mediate between those of normal single and double Csp 2 =O bonds, indicating delocalization of the charge over both O atoms of the COO− group. In the crystal, N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds assemble the ions in layers propagating in the bc plane. This structure {{is very similar to}} that of <b>guanidinium</b> <b>benzoate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Starting from (S) -β-phenylalanine, easily {{accessible}} by lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution, a chiral triamine was assembled by a reductive amination and finally cyclized {{to form the}} title compound 10. In the crystals of the <b>guanidinium</b> <b>benzoate</b> salt the six membered rings of 10 adopt conformations close to an envelope with the phenyl substituents in pseudo-axial positions. The unprotonated guanidine 10 catalyzes Diels–Alder reactions of anthrones and maleimides (25 – 30 % ee). It also promotes as a strong Brønsted base the retro-aldol reaction of some cycloadducts with kinetic resolution of the enantiomers. In three cases, the retro-aldol products (48 – 83 % ee) could be recrystallized to high enantiopurity (≥ 95 % ee). The absolute configuration of several compounds is supported by anomalous X-ray diffraction and by chemical correlation...|$|E
