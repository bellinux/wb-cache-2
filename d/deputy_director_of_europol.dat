5000|$|On 10 March 2009 it was {{reported}} that Libertas intended to field candidates in the UK. Kevin O’Connell, a former <b>deputy</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europol,</b> former commander in the London Metropolitan Police, and former employee of Libertas stated in The Sunday Times that [...] "if Libertas would have me as a candidate, I would run.” O’Connell {{was the first person to}} indicate a willingness to run for Libertas in Britain. Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), criticised Libertas's intention to run in the UK, stating: [...] "I'm a little surprised that Libertas want to stand in the UK as their policy seems almost the same as David Cameron's Conservatives'." [...] Ganley dismissed UKIP's position as [...] "reactionary". Former newspaper editor Bridget Rowe, Nigel Farage's press secretary, then registered Libertas UK with the United Kingdom Electoral Commission, making it unclear whether Ganley's Libertas could field candidates in the UK under that name. On 11 February 2009, Libertas announced the opening of its United Kingdom office at Suite 6.8, 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London, United Kingdom, SW1. Ganley gave a press conference on 10 March 2009 at which the party was launched and he introduced Robin Matthews as its leader.|$|E
