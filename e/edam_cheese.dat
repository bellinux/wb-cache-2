In total 42 volatile compounds were identified, 6 aldehydes, 7 ketones, 15 alcohols, 6 esters and 8 acids. Differences in number of compounds identified, {{as well as in}} the contents of them, were found between samples. Effect of pasteurization on the contents and composition of the identified compounds was the most obvious in the samples of matured cheeses.

40|$|In {{this study}} were {{evaluated}} the <b>Edam</b> <b>cheeses</b> with fat content in dry matter 30 % and 45 % (w/w) produced using two different starter cultures YY and LL during 6 months of ripening. Sampling times were 26, 54, 89, 117, 146 and 180 days after production. The surface and central parts of cheeses have been evaluated separately. Cheese texture was analysed by using a Tira test 27025. The force needed to compress the sample was recorded (N). Ripening time had significant effect on rheological characteristics of the cheeses. The improvement of texture {{was related to the}} ripening time. At the beginning of ripening (1 st month), there is a significantly higher hardness on surface layer of the cheese in samples of cheeses with 30 % fat in dry matter. This is the case in both cultures. This difference has evened out after 2 months of ripening. The force needed to compression of the centrepiece of cheese with lower fat content in dry matter was 30. 96 N and of cheese with higher fat content in dry matter 36. 51 N, while after 60 days of ripening of cheese with lower fat content in dry matter it was 50. 56 N and of cheese with higher fat content in dry matter 63. 23 N. The influence of two different types of starter culture on the texture was evaluated. It was found out that after 60 days of ripening of cheese with 45 % (w/w) fat in dry matter there was significant difference (P ≤ 0. 01) in the firmness between cheese with starter culture YY (force 63. 23 N) and LL (force 48 N). In every Edam sample after 3 months of aging (optimal ripe Edam) there was no dependence on the type of starter culture. After 120 days of ripening {{there was a significant difference}} in firmness of cheese with culture YY (44. 58 N) and LL (33. 61 N). Satistically significant difference (P ≤ 0. 05) between the firmness of the surface and the central parts of the cheese was not found after one month of ripening...|$|R

50|$|Harder cheeses {{have a lower}} {{moisture}} content than softer cheeses. They are generally packed into moulds under more pressure and aged for a longer time than the soft cheeses. Cheeses that are classified as semi-hard to hard include the familiar Cheddar, originating {{in the village of}} Cheddar in England but now used as a generic term for this style of cheese, of which varieties are imitated worldwide and are marketed by strength or the length of time they have been aged.Cheddar is one of a family of semi-hard or hard cheeses (including Cheshire and Gloucester), whose curd is cut, gently heated, piled, and stirred before being pressed into forms. Colby and Monterey Jack are similar but milder cheeses; their curd is rinsed before it is pressed, washing away some acidity and calcium. A similar curd-washing takes place when making the Dutch <b>cheeses</b> <b>Edam</b> and Gouda.|$|R
40|$|Cheese is {{probably}} one of the most ancestral conservation form of major milk components (protein and lipid). It is also a universal food consumed in various parts of the world. Thanks to the knowledge acquired on the composition of milks and development of different dairy technologies performed at artisanal or industrial scale, the Human created a large variety of cheeses. This variety is extraordinary especially in France, with more than 400 different types of cheeses. This diversity is obtained thanks to different practices (milk preparation, curd fabrication, salting and ripening conditions) used during the cheese making. Cheeses can be classified in different ways (origin of milk, heat treatment of milk before its transformation, type of microorganisms used, types of coagulation, level of salt added, conditions of ripening, etc). However, the most common criterion used to classify them is the texture (in relation with the dry matter). Thus we find, on the market, - acid fresh cheeses (Cream cheese, faisselle,…) - soft cheeses (Camembert, Brie, Munster, Epoisses, [...] .) - semi-hard <b>cheeses</b> (<b>Edam,</b> St Paulin, …) - hard cheeses (Emmental, Comté, Beaufort, [...] .) - whey cheeses (Brocciu, …) - processed cheeses (Vache qui rit,…). All these cheeses differ also by their biochemical and microbiological compositions, nutritional properties, tastes, odours, forms, weights, time of conservation...|$|R

50|$|Alkmaar {{has many}} medieval {{buildings}} {{that are still}} intact, most notably the tall tower of the Grote of Sint-Laurenskerk, where many people from Alkmaar hold their wedding ceremony. The other main attraction, especially in the summer months, is Alkmaar's cheese market at the Waagplein, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. The cheese market traditionally takes place on the first Friday in April and the last market of the season is the first Friday in September. Every Friday morning (10:00-12:30) the Waagplein is the backdrop for this traditional cheese market. After the old-fashioned way of the hand clap, traders and carriers will weigh the cheeses. It {{is one of only}} four traditional Dutch cheese markets still in existence. The traditional fare of this cheese market is those cheeses made in the local area, as opposed to the well-known brands of Dutch cheeses, i.e. <b>Edam</b> <b>cheese</b> and Gouda cheese. It is not actually possible to buy cheese at the market itself, which is really only a demonstration of how this merchants' market operated in times gone by. However, the demonstration, which takes place in front of the medieval weighing house, is surrounded by many specialized stalls where it is possible to buy all kinds of cheese (and non-cheese) related products. The Waag is also home to the local tourist office and a cheese museum. Alkmaar has 399 registered rijksmonuments, of which most are situated along the city's old canals.|$|E
