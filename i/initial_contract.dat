5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline would reach a 50% market share.

For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the costs and}} benefits associated with the three courses of action the Marine Corps has used to provide <b>initial</b> <b>contracting</b> training and education to unrestricted Marine officers. The Marine Corps' contracting officer inventory is limited because it does not require Marines to execute multiple contracting tours. I analyzed which course of action would yield the biggest return to the Marine Corps while strengthening the Marine Corps' contracting officer workforce. All three courses of action analyzed allow the Marine to obtain an advanced degree, complete professional military education for his or her grade, and complete the Defense Acquisitions Workforce Improvement Act Level III contracting education required for career field certification. The research shows that the best model to provide <b>initial</b> <b>contracting</b> training and education to Marine unrestricted officers is to use the Contingency Contracting Officer Course or the Defense Acquisition University. After the officer's <b>initial</b> <b>contracting</b> tour, the Marine Corps should use the Naval Postgraduate School as a retention tool to ensure the Marine will execute at least a second contracting tour. After the second contracting tour, the Marine should have the opportunity to make a lateral move into the contracting career field to become the Marine's primary military occupational specialty.

5|$|As <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> {{negotiations}} {{failed in}} the off-season, Cloutier filed for arbitration on July 16, 2004. Arbitration was avoided by both sides when Cloutier agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract 11 days later. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20, 2005. Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner, he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt-based team, going undefeated with a 1.94 GAA. EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second-best record in the league. Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games, recording a 2.75 GAA.

5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, hoping they could leave operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million for the service. From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik.

An operating and security license was granted from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate to Ofotbanen on 11 June.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The <b>initial</b> <b>contract</b> for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E
