5|$|For two years, Hand {{tried to}} succeed {{as a lawyer}} by force of will, giving all his time to the practice. By 1900, he was deeply {{dissatisfied}} with his progress. For intellectual stimulation, he increasingly looked outside his <b>daily</b> <b>work.</b> He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at Albany Law School, and joined a lawyers' discussion group in New York City. He also developed an interest in politics.|$|E
5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their <b>daily</b> <b>work.</b> At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people need}} to wear special clothes such as {{business}} suits or uniforms in their <b>daily</b> <b>work.</b> In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E
25|$|The HACCP {{regulation}} {{requires that}} all plants maintain certain documents, including its hazard analysis and written HACCP plan, and records documenting the monitoring of critical control points, critical limits, verification activities, and {{the handling of}} processing deviations.

The differences among those three types of work are given by Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food.|$|E

25|$|Several {{agencies}} in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA, have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' <b>daily</b> <b>work</b> habits.

These include blogs, RSS, and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Moscati {{remained}} true to {{his faith}} his entire life, taking a vow of chastity and practicing charity in his <b>daily</b> <b>work.</b> He viewed his practice of medical {{science as a}} way of alleviating suffering, not {{as a way of}} making profits, and would retire regularly for prayer. He also attended Mass daily, and would sometimes use a patient's faith, as well as the sacraments, in his treatments. Moscati also refused to charge the poor for their treatment, and was known to sometimes send a patient home with a prescription and a 50-lira note in an envelope.|$|E

Upon {{the death of her}} husband on September 12, 1896, Crittenton added general superintendent to Barrett's roles, which she pursued as a single mother of six. Barrett successfully secured for the NFCM the first-ever federal charter for a charitable organization, through a special act of Congress signed by President William McKinley on April 9, 1898.|$|E

25|$|While prisoners’ labour was {{voluntary}} at the beginning, it very quickly became mandatory, organised into kommandos. The Ministry of War even set <b>daily</b> <b>work</b> quotas. Work in mines and swamps was dreaded as particularly painful; {{most of the}} time, agricultural work allowed for slightly better detention conditions. Certain prisoners, when they were employed by individuals, {{as was the case}} for Robert d’Harcourt and his comrade-in-arms, might be kept in castles, the city taking care to find them shelter. Food was also better than in the camps. Work was fixed at ten hours daily and guard surveillance was reduced (which allowed some prisoners to escape more easily).|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{experiences}} to write about, Alvin and Heidi Toffler {{spent the next}} five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their <b>daily</b> <b>work.</b> He compared his own desire for experience to other writers, such as Jack London, who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas, and John Steinbeck, who went to pick grapes with migrant workers. In their first factory jobs, Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder. In the evenings Alvin would write poetry and fiction, but discovered he was proficient at neither.|$|E
25|$|As secretary, Ivanov was {{responsible}} for coordinating the <b>daily</b> <b>work</b> of the council, led by the president. But Ivanov's role as secretary was initially unclear to media observers. At {{the time of his}} appointment, the Security Council was a relatively new institution. (The council was set up by Yeltsin's tutelage in 1991–1992). Between 1992 and Ivanov's appointment in 1999, Yeltsin used the council as political expediency had dictated, but had not allowed it to emerge as a relatively strong and autonomous institution. Ivanov's predecessors in that post, including Putin, according to Western analysts, were either the second most powerful political figure in Russia or the just another functionary lacking close access to the center of state power, depending on their relationship with Yeltsin.|$|E

25|$|For Francis, {{work is a}} {{gift and}} to work is a grace. <b>Daily</b> <b>work</b> {{is not only the}} means of livelihood, but the {{opportunity}} to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E
25|$|In the burghs {{there were}} {{probably}} high proportions of poor households headed by widows, who survived on casual earnings and the profits from selling foodstuffs or ale. Spinning was an expected part of the <b>daily</b> <b>work</b> of Medieval townswomen of all social classes. In crafts, women could sometimes be apprentices, {{but they could not}} join guilds in their own right. Scotland was relatively poorly supplied with nunneries, but prioresses were figures with considerable authority. There may have been small numbers of anchorites. The Virgin Mary, as the epitome of a wife and mother, was probably an important model for women. Some, usually wives, acting through relatives and husbands as benefactors or property owners connected with local altars and cults of devotion. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century.|$|E
25|$|In Lowland rural society, as in England, {{many young}} people, {{both male and}} female, {{probably}} left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, {{as they can be}} seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century.

Spinning was an expected part of the <b>daily</b> <b>work</b> of Medieval townswomen of all social classes.
