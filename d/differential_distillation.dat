40|$|Reported {{here is the}} {{development}} of a novel evolved gas analysis technique; Sub-Ambient Thermal Volatilization Analysis (SATVA) and its application in characterizing key analyte species from conservation artifacts. In this work SATVA has been applied to the study of volatiles evolution processes occurring in number of model conservation artifacts. The evolution of volatile species from cured formaldehyde resin, leather and metallic artifacts has been studied by SATVA. The specific analytes making up the total quantity of evolved material in each case have been separated and identified using sub-ambient <b>differential</b> <b>distillation</b> and a combination of online mass spectrometry, gas phase IR spectroscopy and GC-MS. The data gathered has been used to provide information on both the degradation processes occurring within the artifacts and the environmental history of the artifacts themselves...|$|E

Model compounds {{were obtained from}} lab reagents purified by Separar espacio. sS se repite, solamente en amarillo mas adelante. ASTM-D 86, DD <b>differential</b> <b>distillation.</b> The emulated primary oil naphtha cut was introduced to a null metallic oxides gasoil residual, obtained by distillation from more than 250 °C, and induced to thermal cracking over 180 ºC and recycled distillate, RD to reboiler. Comparison between both DD and RD distillations were carried by means of normal ASTM-D 86 method which show pertinence of emulating multicomponent primary oil naphtha by four model compounds. RD gas and liquid products show good presence of hydrogen and olefins providing one by side method of both for in situ hydrogen recombination and olefin production. This work suggests performing studies with metallic oxides as catalysts as well as sulfured compounds in a model compoundsmixture with the objective to study new systems that allow to widely understanding the pyrolytic thermal effect during crude primary distillation {{and in this way}} to optimize heavy Maya crude oil distillation gasoline yields...|$|E
40|$|While {{at present}} most energy crops are depriving human feedstock, {{fermentation}} of agricultural residues and fast growing water plants possesses a good prospect {{to become a}} significant source for bio-fuel; as both substrates are widely available and do not require agricultural areas. Water hyacinth for instance can be cultivated in fresh, brackish or wastewater and owing to its rapid growth and availability. Since owing to its natural abundance it {{is considered to be}} an invasive plant in most continents, its utilization and use as a renewable energy source may also contribute for its dilution and control. Agricultural lignocellulosic surplus by-products are also a promising fermentable substrate for bioethanol production, as it decreases both disposal expenses and greenhouse gases emissions. This paper describes a scheme and methodology for transformation of any lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel by simple cost effective operation scheme, integrating an innovative process of mechanochemical activation pre-treatment followed by fermentation of the herbal digest and ethanol production through <b>differential</b> <b>distillation.</b> Under this approach several complex and costly staged of conventional ethanol production scheme may be replaced and by genetic engineering of custom fermenting microorganisms the fermentation process becomes a fully continuous industrial process...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the production of}} methyl laurate from coconut cream through fractionation of methyl esters. Coconut oil was produced by wet processing of coconut cream. The esters were prepared by reacting coconut oil and methanol using homogeneous catalyst KOH in a batch reactor, followed by fractionation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) at various reduced pressures applying <b>differential</b> batch vacuum <b>distillation.</b> Experimental data were compared with simulation of a batch distillation employing the simple Raoult 2 ̆ 7 s model and modified Raoult 2 ̆ 7 s model of phase equilibria. Activity coefficients (γi) were determined by optimization to refine the models. The modified Rault 2 ̆ 7 s model with activity coefficients gave better agreement with the experimental data, giving the value of γi between 0, 56 - 0, 73. For a given boiling temperature, lower operating pressure produced higher purity of C 10 and C 12 FAME for respective distillates...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oils are {{important}} compounds {{of the human}} diet {{and they should be}} refined before consumption. Consumers demand for healthier products as well as stiff environmental legislation are forcing refining industries towards changes and improvement of processes. In this context, this thesis has as main objective to investigate/improve the physical refining of vegetable oils, emphasizing the bleaching step. As first step, a HPLC methodology for simultaneous quantification of carotenes and tocols was developed and validated, and lately, it was used by our research groups. Then, bleaching step of palm oil, nowadays the most consumed oil in the world, was studied under different aspects: (1) determining kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamic parameters of adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth; (2) influence of different procedures on final color of palm oil; (3) influence of bleaching earth kind on final color of palm oil. These studies were important for a better understanding of bleaching process of palm oil, and some conclusions were obtained: adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth occurs by chemisorption and it is endothermic; new procedures in the bleaching step can improve final color of palm oil when using the same amount of bleaching earth and deodorization time; a hypothesis was proposed to explain how the kind of bleaching earth can interfere in the final color of palm oil. Further studies are still necessary to optimize bleaching step and the new procedures suggested. Later, physical deacidification was studied by computer simulation and experimental data from literature. It was compared two mathematical approaches: <b>differential</b> and flash <b>distillations.</b> This last one presented better results regarding acidity and neutral oil loss profiles. In this approach, it was considered the heat transfer equations. In this way, this thesis presents an advance in refining process towards high quality products and the use of less chemicals...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a {{comprehensive}} study on a TDI-based foam containing 13 % ammonium polyphosphate (APP) {{in order to}} examine the effect that this conventional fire retardant has on the thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation behaviour of the polyurethane foam. The results from TVA and TGA analyses show that the APP foam undergoes a significantly different degradation mechanism to the standard foam that we have reported on previously. The TGA results revealed the presence of a two-stage degradation process under a non-oxidative environment. The TVA results, on the other hand, revealed that degradation of the APP foam in fact occurs in four overlapping steps compared to the two-step process which occurs for the standard foam. The additional degradation steps observed for the APP foam are proposed to correspond to degradation of the fire retardant. Evolution of volatile material was also observed to occur at a lower temperature for the APP foam and it is proposed that the primary degradation of the urethane linkages via a depolycondensation reaction is acid-catalysed by the acidic hydroxyl groups which arise from degradation of APP. The sub-ambient <b>differential</b> <b>distillation</b> trace revealed that the nature and distribution of the volatiles evolved from the APP foam were profoundly different to the standard foam, which confirms that the secondary degradation is also altered in the presence of APP...|$|E
