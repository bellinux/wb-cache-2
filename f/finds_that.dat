40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} retail investor attention, measured by Google Search Volume Index (SVI), on price revision, underpricing and post-IPO performance. We also investigate how these three IPO phenomena affect each other. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> SVI between filing and initial pricing predicts price revision. Furthermore, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> IPOs with either a very high increase or decrease in Google searches during the filing period experience {{the highest level of}} underpricing. Moreover, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> positive price revisions results in higher underpricing. Lastly, we do not find any relationship between SVI during the filing period and post-IPO performance. Instead, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> SCOOP rating, representing expected first-day premium, predicts underperformance. Hence, our results are more in line with the anticipation theory than the attention theory. In addition, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> IPOs with very high or very low first-day return underperform other IPOs...|$|R

However, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> such a transition in real GaAs is not possible and CF state cannot become a boson. Simon et al suggest that {{the total number of}} CF and CB is conserved. However, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the number of quasiparticles need not be conserved. Similarly, Simon et al suggest that CFs are formed but we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> this formation does not conserve energy so that CFs will not be formed. Simon et al compute using products of fermion and boson wave functions. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the mass of the CF is much too larger than experimental mass.

The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{composition}} of creative teams of academic scientists engaged in inventive activity. Our data provides {{a unique opportunity to}} explore the links between team composition and commercialization outcomes. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> there are coordination costs associated with reaching across academic departments and organizational boundaries to build teams. However, we also find evidence of benefits due to knowledge diversity, particularly in the cases of truly novel combinations. In support of internal cohesion arguments, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> performance improves with the experience of the team. In line with arguments regarding the value of diverse external networks, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> teams that are composed of members from multiple institutions - focal university, other research institution, and/or industry - are more successful in generating patents, licenses, and royalties. Finally, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the presence of prior social ties supporting links with external team members positively influences commercial outcomes. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> there is no benefit to proximity in team configuration. Invention teams Academic scientists Team performance...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E

We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the quality of medical care (negligence) is an extremely important determinant of defendants' medical malpractice liability. More generally, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the data are consistent with a model in which plaintiffs are poorly informed ex ante about whether there has been negligence, file suit to gather information, and either drop the case if they <b>find</b> <b>that</b> negligence was unlikely or settle for a positive payoff if they <b>find</b> <b>that</b> negligence was likely.
