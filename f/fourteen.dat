40|$|The Mesozoic Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin is a northwest-southeast {{trending}} structural element, {{situated in}} the southern North Sea, Netherlands offshore. Biodegraded and water-washed oils in the southern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin indicate topography-driven meteoric water flow during Late Cretaceous inversion. Density-driven groundwater flow models support {{the development of a}} freshwater lens in the northern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin during Late Cretaceous inversion. Three model scenarios with basin-scale permeabilities and water table heads within the range of most likely values show the possible development of a freshwater lens in the northern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin. The freshwater-saltwater interface is located at a depth of 200 - 1200 m below mean sea level. Near steady-state flow conditions are reached within 1. 5 - 4 Myr. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A basin-scale hydrogeological {{study of}} the {{inverted}} northern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin, Netherlands offshore, {{has resulted in a}} reconstruction of geological evolution, an estimate of Late Cretaceous topography and model scenarios of syn-inversion meteoric water infiltration. This study was performed in the scope of a basin-scale analysis of the hydrogeological setting and hydrodynamic evolution of the Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin. This analysis is aimed at obtaining quantitative knowledge of depositional history and hydrogeological parameters, and qualitative knowledge of hydrodynamic evolution of the Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin from Carboniferous to present-day. We present an overview of the tectonic and depositional history, the most likely hydrogeological setting and model scenarios of Late Cretaceous meteoric water infiltration in the northern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> area. We constructed a detailed south-west north-east geological cross-section of the present-day northern Broad <b>Fourteens</b> Basin, and reconstructed Late Cretaceous basin geometry and topography. Using this geometry in a numerical model of density-dependent topography-driven fluid flow, we modelled several scenarios of meteoric water infiltration with estimated ranges of basin-scale permeabilities and water table head. Results indicate that a deep freshwater lens was developed during Late Cretaceous inversion, if the basin-scale hydraulic conductivity of the Rijnland and Altena Groups was at least 1 · 10 – 9 to 1 · 10 – 10 m/s, which is in general the highest value for claystones.
