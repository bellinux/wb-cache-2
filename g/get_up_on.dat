Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, but if we <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Day ten {{brought the}} lightest winds {{seen in the}} 34th America's Cup.

2500|$|Unlike most game shows, {{there is}} no minimum age {{necessary}} to participate in [...] "Family Feud." [...] Each round begins with a [...] "face-off" [...] question {{that serves as a}} toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people (e.g., [...] "Name the hour that you <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Sunday mornings."). A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers that receive two or more responses can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the Combs version, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).|$|E
