50|$|The D-DIA {{is based}} on the similar DIA, which is a cubic-anvil apparatus. The D-DIA is a type of multi-anvil {{deformation}} apparatus that uses 6 cubically arranged anvils to provide independent pressurization and deformation of the sample. Four anvils of the cubic arrangement are oriented in the horizontal opposing at 90°, and the remaining two anvils are oriented in the vertical within two <b>guide</b> <b>blocks.</b> The back side of each horizontal anvil comprises two faces of a virtual octahedron. By the symmetry imposed from the advancing <b>guide</b> <b>blocks</b> and anvils, all axes of the virtual octahedron are then strained equally and thus provide hydrostatic pressure to the sample.In order to create a deviatoric stress, oil is pumped using two differential rams behind the top and bottom anvils located within the <b>guide</b> <b>blocks</b> allowing them to advance independent of the other four. By advancing just one anvil pair, a deviatoric stress is created thus altering the previously cubic stress field to one that is tetragonal. The induced flow is approximately axially-symmetric with respect to the cylindrical sample). By advancing an anvil pair pressure would begin to increase on the sample as deformation progresses, but the D-DIA has the capability of bleeding off oil from the main ram (which engages the <b>guide</b> <b>blocks)</b> while advancing the differential pumps, in order to maintain a constant sample pressure during deformation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Pain {{control is}} the most {{important}} issue in emergency department management of patients with femoral bone fractures. The present study aimed to compare the procedural features of ultrasonography and nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral nerve <b>block</b> in this regard. Method: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with proximal femoral fractures presenting to emergency department were randomly divided into two groups of ultrasonography or nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> and compared regarding success rate, procedural time, block time, and need for rescue doses of morphine sulfate, using SPSS 20. Results: 50 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 25 (60 % male). The mean age of studied patients was 35. 14 ± 12. 95 years (19 – 69). The two groups were similar regarding age (p= 0. 788), sex (p = 0. 564), and initial pain severity (p = 0. 513). In 2 cases of nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> <b>block,</b> loss of pinprick sensation did not happen within 30 minutes of injection (success rate: 92 %; p = 0. 490). Ultrasonography <b>guided</b> nerve <b>block</b> cases had significantly lower procedural time (8. 06 ± 1. 92 vs 13. 60 ± 4. 56 minutes; p < 0. 001) and lower need for rescue doses of opioid (2. 68 ± 0. 74 vs 5. 28 ± 1. 88 minutes; p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Ultrasonography and nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> had the same success rate and block duration. However, the ultrasonography guided group had lower procedure time and lower need for rescue doses of morphine sulfate. Therefore, ultrasonography <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> could be considered as an available, safe, rapid, and efficient method for pain management of femoral fracture in emergency department.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} effect and usefulness of ultrasound <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> for the outpatients who complained of chronic lower back pain. Summary of Literature Review: Facet joint syndrome was introduced in 1976, by Mooney V. It {{was considered to be}} one of the major causes of low back pain. Materials and Methods: Between October 2009 to March 2011, 98 cases were selected from the outpatients who complained of chronic lower back pain for more than 3 months. The patients had no surgery history and did not complain of neuromuscular symptoms, and they had more than three times outpatient care at least and could be followed up for 1 year. The patients were divided into three groups; first was the ultrasound <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group (27 cases), second was the Fluoroscopy <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group (39 cases) and third was the conservative group (32 cases). The clinical results were analyzed using Kim’s criteria and the Visual Analog Scale score, ODI score, Physician’s global assessment (subjective), Patient’s global assessment (Objective). Results: The VAS score was improved from an average of 7. 75 ± 1. 5 to 4. 47 ± 2. 4 in the ultrasound <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group, and from 7. 81 ± 1. 4 to 4. 39 ± 2. 6 in the Fluoroscopy <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group, and from 7. 87 ± 1. 3 to 6. 24 ± 2. 1 in the conservative group.

40|$|Total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) {{has been}} performed {{for patients with}} end-stage knee joint arthritis to relieve pain and gain functions.

40|$|Past {{claims of}} the {{suitability}} of the MA- 8 multianvil press as a deformation apparatus may have been overstated. On the basis of measurements of final octahedron size and of guide block displacement {{as a function of}} time, using the 10 / 5, 14 / 8, and 18 / 11 assemblies (octahedron edge length in mm/truncation edge length in mm) with MgO octahedra and pyrophyllite gasketing, it appears that at run conditions of interest to most researchers there is no appreciable time-dependent creep of gaskets and octahedra. All inelastic deformation occurs at rather low pressures: below about 10 GPa for the 10 / 5, 7 GPa for the 14 / 8, and 6 GPa for the 18 / 11 assemblies, with substantial uncertainties in these pressures. Above these limits all deformation of the pressure medium is elastic. Pressure stepping as a means of increasing the inelastic deformation rate of a sample is probably ineffective. Displacement measured at the <b>guide</b> <b>blocks,</b> previously believed to indicate deformation of the gaskets and octahedron, appears now to be unrelated to creep of these components. The calibrations have not been exhaustive and there is considerable scatter in some of the size measurements, so the above conclusions are not unequivocal. The calibrations do not exclude the possibility of deformation of a few tens of microns after the attainment of high pressure. Efforts to impose permanent shape change to samples at high pressure and temperature simply by relying on long run durations must be viewed with skepticism. There may be possibilities for deformation in the multianvil apparatus if materials of contrasting elastic modulus are used to differentially load a sample during pressure stepping...|$|E
40|$|The Tactile Ground Surface Indicator (TGSI) is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} made in Japan for people who are blind or visually impaired. When it came to installing this device, many countries tried to follow the Japanese way of doing this procedure. A survey was conducted in 16 countries and 1 region; 5 countries in Europe, 2 in Pan-America, 2 in Oceania, 7 in Asia and 1 region, by using a field work for detecting barrier-free to check how properly or improperly the TGSI were installed. The results of the survey from these countries from around the world, found the TGSI were installed all over urban areas of the leading cities in Asia, and mainly around rail stations and underground railway stations in Europe, Pan-America and Oceania. However, we found some of the TGSI all over the world were installed improperly which included the same mistakes as found in Japan such as; That no warning blocks were installed at the point where <b>guide</b> <b>blocks</b> crossed each other, or that the TGSI were installed improperly so that people in wheelchairs felt them barriers. Also, many of these countries {{had to come up with}} their on variation of ways of installing the TGSI even though they were following the standard Japanese way of installation. This has prevented us from unifying and creating a global standard for the TGSI. In addition, we found that the intermixed way of installing the TGSI by the Japanese rule and its peculiar rule in a certain country had prevented people who are blind or visually impaired from using them easily. The consensus was proposed that there should be a global standardized manual created to unify the way in which the TGSI is installed for everyone. Creating a guideline for installing the TGSI has been demanded by many groups of people who are blind or visually impaired from all over the world and the detailed results of this study surveyed in many countries can be very important data for creating a guideline.

40|$|Abstract: The {{practice}} of regional anaesthesia will be probably forever {{changed by the}} introduction of ultra-sonography into everyday clinical practice. The ability to now visualise directly the spread of local anaesthetic solution and its relationship with the nerve allows for immediate adjustments to needle position and/or local anaesthetic volume and spread resulting theoratically in improved block performance through faster onset, reduced local anaesthetic volumes and higher success rates. However, whether US <b>guided</b> <b>blocks</b> will ever replace neurostimulation techniques is debatable espe-cially when regional anaesthesia is performed by special-ists in the field. Key words: Ultrasound guidance; peripheral nerve blocks; epidural blocks. In recent years, the {{practice of}} regional anaes-thesia has been forever changed {{by the introduction of}} ultrasonography into everyday practice. The abi-lity of ultrasound (US) to visualise nerves as well as structures (vessels, pleura) to be avoided, has resul-ted in increased confidence for anaesthesiologists performing regional anaesthetic techniques. US <b>guided</b> nerve <b>blocks</b> provide real-time imaging of needle position and facilitate nerve location even when anatomical variations from traditional land-marks are present. The techniques traditionally used for regional anesthesia procedure guidance inclu-ded either subjective perceptions of arterial pulses or fascial “pops ” or more objectives aims as trans arterial approaches or nerve stimulation. The ability to now visualise directly the spread of local anaes-thetic solution and its relationship with the nerve allows for immediate adjustments to needle posi-tion and/or local anaesthetic volume and spread resulting theoratically in improved block perfor-mance through faster onset, reduced local anaesthe-tic volumes and higher success rates (1, 2, 3). The recent literature reflects the exponential evolution of ultrasound <b>guided</b> regional <b>blocks</b> from descrip-tive studies demonstrating its feasability to prospec-tive RCT comparing ultrasounds to other classical techniques of guidance. Regional anaesthetic tech-niques such as the supra-clavicular block, or sub-gluteal sciatic nerve approach that were considered high risk or challenging, may now be undertaken with the knowledge that needle position relative to other structures is known...|$|R
