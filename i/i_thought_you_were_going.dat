60|$|HARRY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to {{play tennis}} this afternoon.|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Splendid! Oh, what a relief! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be broken-hearted. Never mind me. Damn him again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When are {{you going}} to settle {{yourself}} in some Christian sort of place, Liz? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do it before now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, you're {{a little}} bit more of a real man than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> willing to do {{anything}} against me and my brothers." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{beg your}} pardon. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> asking for information.|$|R
60|$|MANGAN. Well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> rather {{particular}} about people's characters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who! I?' exclaimed the Marquis. 'I {{never was}} wider awake. What {{are you waiting}} for, Reginald? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to take wasps' nests.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} turning back," [...] she said. [...] "Why did you turn back? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> over the divide to Little Grizzly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Mr. Cuthbert, [...] "I'll {{manage that}} all right. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to see the}} {{representative}} of a syndicate at eleven." ...|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: (Fascinated) <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> of good stock by your accent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never coming. <b>I</b> begged {{you to come}} at once.|$|R
60|$|JESSIE (after a pause). Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{so fond of}} Miss Edgeworth.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Somers: [...] "I didn't mean that. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to--go." [...] She puts up {{her hand}} and hides a triumphant little smile with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] said Forster; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to ring Grimes {{about that}} theatre party for Thursday night. Had you {{forgotten}} about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Men {{are very}} clumsy,' said she. 'I {{knew you were}} on every train. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to speak to me, and I'm glad you didn't.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{never going}} to leave the lady in black velvet.|$|R
30|$|Youâ€™re not the {{friendly}} guy <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> (Kurt shifts {{in his chair}} and sighs).|$|R
60|$|CUSINS. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{determined}} {{to turn your}} back on the wicked side of life.|$|R
60|$|Just now, this afternoon, I {{would never}} have said what I did only <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> I wasn't myself then, Ronny. I ought never to have....|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} how you see things. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to say you would marry me!" [...] Benyon rejoined, standing there still, though the dray had passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My head {{is going}} round," [...] she declared. [...] "This is Wednesday. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to stay away}} until I wrote you--not that I wanted you to." ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie (Defending herself). Why should I {{make the}} poor old friendless man miserable? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> far away. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> dead. <b>I</b> didn't know but <b>you</b> had never <b>been</b> born. I... I... (Harry turns to her. She desperately.) It {{was easier to}} believe it myself. (Carried away.) And after all it's true. It's come to pass. This is the to-morrow we've been waiting for.|$|R
60|$|Cecily. Oh, I merely {{came back}} to water the roses. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> with Uncle Jack.|$|R
60|$|MRS. JUNO. You {{never told}} me you couldn't fight, Tops. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> an {{accomplished}} boxer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to tell me something}} I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{not likely}} to have a chance. But I say, Ken, how did you happen to turn up? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to hop on the first train for home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear friend, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to leave}} me!" [...] she cried. [...] "How {{agitated}} I am--feel how my heart beats. Never mind, I can now pay that wretch out. Is not revenge sweet, sweet, sweet?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... (I saw you {{in passing}} at the temple. In that {{beautiful}} lace, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the Virgin.) ...|$|R
60|$|HECTOR. Some day I shall kill you, {{if you go}} too far. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a fool.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sailor!' exclaimed {{the acute}} utilitarian, his curiosity {{stifling}} his hauteur. 'Why! just now, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a soldier.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he entreated; [...] "tell me {{a little}} more about the old people first. This {{digression}} about the ladies has been very interesting, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to speak of the men here. Who are they, or, rather, what are they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of all things!" [...] {{burst out}} Laura. [...] "Say, Dave, will you ever settle down? Here <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to take a}} nice little personally-conducted tour with us, and you talk of going land knows {{where to look for}} a lost gold mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it is the}} old minister's fault. Why shouldn't {{you take}} the chance as well as another? It isn't many days ago since you were quite anxious to remain in. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to break your heart because people even talked of your going." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a brave man. They wouldn't {{have given}} you that medal if you'd been a coward.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bell gave a {{prolonged}} whistle. [...] "Excuse me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> Mrs. Something-or-other for sure. Aren't you mistress here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a leetle mite {{smarter than}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was.</b> So long. Got a leetle {{business}} now--you understand a leetle business." ...|$|R
