50|$|Generalized anxiety {{disorder}} {{is based on}} psychological components that include cognitive avoidance, positive worry beliefs, ineffective problem-solving and emotional processing, interpersonal issues, previous trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping,</b> emotional hyperarousal, poor understanding of emotions, negative cognitive reactions to emotions, maladaptive emotion management and regulation, experiential avoidance, and behavioral restriction. To combat the previous cognitive and emotional aspects of GAD, psychologists often include some of the following key treatment components in their intervention plan; self-monitoring, relaxation techniques, self-control desensitization, gradual stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, worry outcome monitoring, present-moment focus, expectancy-free living, problem-solving techniques, processing of core fears, socialization, discussion and reframing of worry beliefs, emotional skills training, experiential exposure, psychoeducation, mindfulness and acceptance exercises. There exist behavioral, cognitive, and {{a combination of both}} treatments for GAD that focus on some of those key components.|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} a {{longitudinal}} design {{to examine whether}} maladaptive perfectionism and <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> served as 2 mediators {{of the relation between}} adult attachment and future depression.

40|$|The {{revolution}} of 1989 in Eastern Europe and their aftermath {{have led to}} a growing concern about whether modern states are losing their capacities for governance, and whether national-level processes are ceding their primacy to global ones. Believing capital is becoming more mobile and has no national attachments, national politics and political choices are considered to have been sidelined by the global market forces while transnational corporations are perceived as the key players in defining not only economic, but also social and political agendas. Hence, national-level governance is regarded as <b>ineffective</b> in <b>coping</b> with challenges generated from globalizing economic and social processes.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to clarify the {{developmental}} risk for interpersonal relationship problems and <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> strategies associated with hyperactive behaviour in girls in a longitudinal epidemiological design. This was investigated in a follow-up study of girls who were identified by parent and teacher ratings in a large community survey of 6 - and 7 -year-olds as showing pervasive hyperactivity or conduct problems or the comorbid mixture of both problems or neither problem. They were later investigated, at the age of 14 – 16 years, in a detailed interview. Childhood hyperactivity was a risk for disrupted relationships in adolescence with peers and the opposite sex, but not parents. Findings were independent of the existence of conduct problems. Hyperactivity was a risk for the use of a wide variety of <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> strategies. On the other hand, conduct problem girls reported applying specific coping strategies, but rated these to be ineffective.

Fusion was implied in many <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> strategies such as worrying, rumination and getting angry.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Stress {{coping skills}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors in prediction of addictive behavior. The purpose of this study was to determine this pattern and to compare them with those of non-addicts. &# 13; Methods. One hundred subjects with substance dependency and 100 non-addict subjects were selected. Both groups were matched on the basis of their socioeconomic state. Stress coping skills of study participants were examined using CS-R scale. &# 13; Results. Stress coping skills in addicts were different from those of non-addicts in most of the coping procedures. Nonaddicts reported that they used problem-focused coping and some of the emotional-focused coping strategies. In contrast, addicts shown that they used unuseful and noneffective stress coping strategies. &# 13; Discussion. These data indicate that using <b>ineffective</b> stress <b>coping</b> skills is one of-the predisposing and precipitating factors in addictive behavior.

40|$|Objective: Cancer is {{a disease}} that not only affects the individual′s mental and {{physical}} integrity but also affects the functionality of the family system. Caregivers experience stress when patients cannot cope with the symptoms they are experiencing. The stress experienced by caregivers gives rise to psychological and physical symptoms. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the attitude of coping with stress of family caregivers of cancer patients. Methods: This study was conducted as a descriptive research at the Medical Oncology Clinic. The study sample group comprised of 127 family caregivers. In the collection of the data, the Personel Information Form and Attitude of Coping with Stress Inventory were used. Results: The coping attitude used most frequently by family caregivers was active planning, and the least used coping attitude was avoidance isolation (biochemical). There was no significant statistical difference between the coping attitude depending on the descriptive characteristics of the family caregivers (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Results show that family caregivers of cancer patients tend to choose effective coping methods. However, there were still caregivers that displayed <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> attitudes. Therefore, it is important to support the effective coping attitudes of caregivers and intervene in order to change the <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> attitudes...|$|E
30|$|A third {{psychological}} flexibility {{process is}} ‘acceptance’ of difficult internal experiences (thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations). Several respondents identified this strategy, stating they accepted events {{outside of their}} control and focussed on what they could influence.

40|$|Abstract — Multihop {{wireless}} mesh {{networks are}} becoming a new attractive communication paradigm. Many cities and public places have deployed or are planning to deploy mesh networks to provide Internet access to residents and local businesses. Routing protocol design {{is critical to the}} performance and reliability of wireless mesh networks. Traditional routing protocols send traffic along pre-determined paths and have been shown <b>ineffective</b> in <b>coping</b> with unreliable and unpredictable wireless medium. In this paper, we develop a Simple Opportunistic Adaptive Routing protocol (SOAR) for wireless mesh networks. SOAR maximizes the progress each packet makes by using priority-based timers to ensure that the most preferred node forwards the packet with little coordination overhead. Moreover, SOAR minimizes resource consumption and duplicate transmissions by judiciously selecting forwarding nodes to prevent routes from diverging. To further protect against packet losses, SOAR uses local recovery to retransmit a packet when an ACK is not received within a specified time. SOAR uses a combination of selective ACKs, piggyback ACKs, and ACK compression to protect against ACK loss while minimizing ACK overhead. We evaluate SOAR using NS- 2 simulations. Our preliminary results show that SOAR is promising to achieve high efficiency and effectively support multiple simultaneous flows. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nodes {{in mobile}} ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) usually cooperate and forward each other’s packets {{in order to}} enable out of range communication. However, in hostile environments some nodes may refuse {{to do so for}} either saving their resources or intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered {{as one of the most}} destructive attacks that leads to the deterioration of network performance. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility of nodes, make prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives <b>ineffective</b> to <b>cope</b> with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this survey, we make a comprehensive investigation on state-of-the-art countermeasures to packet dropping attack. Fur-thermore, we examine the challenges that must be tackled for constructing an in-depth defense against such sophisticated attack...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol is a {{socially}} recognized, legal luxury food in Germany. Alcohol dependence is simultaneously the largest dependency problem {{of our society}} and can result from moderate alcohol consumption. An early arising complication of harmful alcohol consumption are injuries which are connected with {{a high rate of}} Retrauma. Harmful alcohol consumption may be partly the result of <b>ineffective</b> <b>coping</b> strategies. The sense of coherence (SOC) measures the extent to which people are able to cope with stress factors. The survey was carried out in the surgical emergency department of the Charité university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Overall, 2000 patients were screened for sense of coherence and hazardous alcohol consumption, smoking and illicit drug abuse as well as socioeconomic status. Of our participants 62 % were male and the mean age was 32 years (range 18  89 years). Overall, 23 % of our participants consumed alcohol in a harmful extent. There {{was no significant difference between}} genders in terms of harmful alcohol consumption. The mean SOC score was 49 (+ 8, 56) points, with no difference between men and women. Lower SOC-Scores were significantly associated with harmful alcohol consumption as well as smoking and the abuse of illicit drugs. The association between SOC and alcohol consumption was independent of age, gender, ISS, smoking and illicit drug abuse.

It is also criticized as <b>ineffective</b> to <b>cope</b> with the trends in land tenure delivery at peri-urban areas where individualization of land and demand for land is high. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate how customary land tenure systems of Ghana meet the dynamic need of the modern life in peri-urban areas. The study used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods including general and in-depth interviews, oral narrations, focus group discussions and questionnaires to collect and analyze data from stakeholders in three peri-urban areas of the three land owning groups in Ghana. The study shows that the institutional framework is resilient with the customary land tenure institutions maintaining their traditional power to allocate land and resolve land conflicts. The findings from the study have implications for land administration in peri-urban areas. Cadastres in these areas do not reflect the situation on the ground.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} employee burnout within a post-disaster context by exploring teachers’ burnout perceptions and workplace attitudes {{in the aftermath of}} the 2010 - 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. The study hypothesised that burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion and cynicism) would be related with the extent to which individuals and schools were impacted by the earthquakes, and with the quality of school support for staff and students (i. e., personal disaster impact, school disaster impact and school responsiveness to the disaster), with perceptions of role conflict and role overload, and with turnover intentions. Additionally, a Teacher Burnout Model was proposed whereby emotional exhaustion and cynicism were hypothesised to mediate the relationships between the independent variables (i. e., the disaster-related and role-related variables) and turnover intentions. 125 primary, intermediate and secondary school teachers from the city of Christchurch completed an online survey. Results revealed that high role overload, high role conflict, high school disaster impact, and schools’ <b>ineffective</b> disaster <b>coping</b> responses, were associated with increased levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Although greater impact of earthquakes on teachers’ personal lives was related to higher levels of emotional exhaustion, results revealed a non-significant relationship between personal disaster impact and cynicism. In the Teacher Burnout Model, the relationships between both role stress variables and turnover intentions were mediated by perceptions of emotional exhaustion. This study contributes novel findings to the burnout literature, and provides implications for schools and organisations operating within a disaster context...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This article {{critically}} reviewed {{empirical studies}} identifying {{factors that may}} influence parental stress when caring for a child with an intellectual disability. Understanding the factors influencing parental stress is important for several reasons, which include improving parental/child quality of life, supporting parental needs, and thus reducing potential economic burden in the long term. This review is also imperative for ensuring high quality research within this field. Method: AMED, CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost), EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO were accessed to conduct a critical literature review. A total of 17 articles were reviewed. A bespoke quality assessment tool was developed to examine the susceptibility to bias {{for each of the}} included studies. Results: The review outlined a range of child, parent and socio-environmental factors that may influence parental stress. More specifically, factors associated with greater parental stress included child behavioural difficulties (e. g. challenging behaviour), <b>ineffective</b> parental <b>coping</b> strategies (including avoidance and self-blame), and poor family environment (e. g. lack of cohesion amongst family members). These factors are critically discussed alongside contrasting evidence that was illuminated within this review. Conclusions: Parents of a child with an intellectual disability are not a homogenous group and are likely to show variability in the factors that affect their stress levels. Future clinical and research implications are proposed in light of the methodological limitations identified within the studies reviewed. For example, future research could investigate the bi-directional effects that occur between variables; how specific factors influence parental stress; and potential mediating/moderating factors of parenting stress...|$|R
