40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of <b>ebselen</b> {{has been linked}} to its peroxidase activity. In the present study, the peroxidase activity of <b>ebselen</b> toward H 2 O 2 with the endogenous thiols GSH and dihydrolipoate [L(SH) 2] as cofactors was determined. When GSH was used, peroxide removal was described by a ter uni ping pong mechanism with Dalziel coefficients for GSH and H 2 O 2 of 0. 165 +/- 0. 011 and 0. 081 +/- 0. 005 mM min, respectively. When L(SH) 2 was used, peroxidase activity was independent of the concentration of L(SH) 2 in the concentration range studied (5 microM to 2 mM) and peroxide removal was only dependent on the concentration of H 2 O 2 and <b>ebselen,</b> with the second-order rate constant being 12. 3 +/- 0. 8 mM- 1 min- 1. To elucidate the difference between GSH and L(SH) 2, the molecular mechanism of the peroxidase activity of <b>ebselen</b> was investigated, using UV spectrophotometry, high pressure liquid chromatography, 77 Se NMR, and mass spectrometry. GSH was found to react quickly with <b>ebselen</b> to give a selenenyl sulfide, an adduct of GSH to <b>ebselen.</b> Subsequently, the GSH-selenenyl sulfide is converted into the diselenide of <b>ebselen.</b> Finally the diselenide reacts with a peroxide and <b>ebselen</b> is regenerated. The formation by GSH of the diselenide from the GSH-selenenyl sulfide of <b>ebselen</b> is slow and linearly dependent on the concentration of free thiol; however, no net consumption of GSH was observed. Furthermore, it is likely that a selenol is an intermediate in diselenide formation. After reaction between <b>ebselen</b> and L(SH) 2 the diselenide of <b>ebselen</b> was immediately detected. The fast formation of the diselenide with L(SH) 2 versus the slow formation of the diselenide with GSH accounts for our observation that L(SH) 2 is a better cofactor than GSH in the peroxidase activity of <b>ebselen.</b> Our results suggest that the interaction between <b>ebselen</b> and L(SH) 2 might be of major importance in the mechanism by which <b>ebselen</b> exerts its {{therapeutic effect}}...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS 3) {{is both a}} protease, which cleaves viral {{and host}} proteins, and a helicase that separates nucleic acid strands, using ATP hydrolysis to fuel the reaction. Many antiviral drugs, and compounds in clinical trials, target the NS 3 protease, but few helicase inhibitors that function as antivirals have been reported. This study focuses on {{the analysis of the}} mechanism by which <b>ebselen</b> (2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzisoselenazol- 3 -one), a compound previously shown to be a HCV antiviral agent, inhibits the NS 3 helicase. <b>Ebselen</b> inhibited the abilities of NS 3 to unwind nucleic acids, to bind nucleic acids, and to hydrolyze ATP, and about 1 μM <b>ebselen</b> was sufficient to inhibit each of these activities by 50 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{antioxidant}} {{mechanism of}} <b>ebselen</b> in rats brain is largely linked with its glutathione peroxidase (GPx) {{rather than its}} peroxiredoxin mimicry ability. However, the precise molecular dynamics between the GPx-mimicry of <b>ebselen</b> and thiol utilization {{is yet to be}} fully clarified and thus still open. Herein, we investigated the influence of dithiothreitol (DTT) on the antioxidant action of <b>ebselen</b> against oxidant-induced cerebral lipid peroxidation and deoxyribose degradation. Furthermore, the critical inhibitory concentrations of <b>ebselen</b> on the activities of sulphydryl enzymes such as cerebral sodium pump, δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALAD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also investigated. We observe that <b>ebselen</b> (at ⩾ 42 μM) markedly inhibited lipid peroxidation in the presence and absence of DTT, whereas it inhibited deoxyribose degradation only in the presence of DTT. Furthermore, under in vitro conditions, <b>ebselen</b> inhibited the thiol containing enzymes; cerebral sodium pump (at ⩾ 40 μM), δ-ALAD (⩾ 10 μM) and LDH (⩾ 1 μM) which were either prevented or reversed by DTT. However, the inhibition of the activities of these sulphydryl proteins in diabetic animals was prevented by <b>ebselen.</b> Summarily, it is apparent that the effective in vitro inhibitory doses of <b>ebselen</b> on the activity of the sulphydryl proteins are far less than its antioxidant doses. In addition, the presence of DTT is evidently a critical requirement for <b>ebselen</b> to effect its antioxidant action against deoxyribose degeradation and not lipid peroxidation. Consequently, we conclude that <b>ebselen</b> possibly utilizes available thiols on sulphydryl proteins to effect its GPx mimicry antioxidant action against lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ebselen</b> (2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzisoselenazol- 3 [2 H]-one) is a selenoorganic {{compound}} exhibiting both {{glutathione peroxidase}} activity and antioxidant activity. Although {{it has been}} reported that <b>ebselen</b> is effective for oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage both in vivo and clinically, the precise mechanisms of the efficacy have not yet been elucidated. Thus, we hypothesized that <b>ebselen</b> may affect reactive oxygen species-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in cultured PC 12 cells. Our findings showed that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) stimulated rapid and significant activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38 in PC 12 cells, which is a model of catecholamine-containing neurons. H 2 O 2 -induced JNK activation was inhibited by <b>ebselen,</b> whereas ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 activation by H 2 O 2 were not affected by <b>ebselen.</b> Inhibition by <b>ebselen</b> of H 2 O 2 -induced hydroxyl radical generation in PC 12 cells was observed using electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. <b>Ebselen</b> also inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced increases in DNA binding activity of activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), a downstream transcription factor of JNK, composed of the c-Jun homo/heterodimer. Finally, pretreatment of cells with <b>ebselen</b> resulted in a significant recovery from cell death including apoptosis by H 2 O 2 in PC 12 cells.

40|$|<b>Ebselen</b> [2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzisoselenazol- 3 (2 H) -one], a seleno-organic {{compound}} with glutathione peroxidase-like {{activity is}} used in clinical trials against stroke. Human and bovine TrxR catalyzed the reduction of <b>ebselen</b> to <b>ebselen</b> selenol by NADPH with an apparent KM-value of 2. 5 μM and a kcat of 588 min− 1. The addition of thioredoxin (Trx) stimulated the TrxR-catalyzed reduction of <b>ebselen</b> several-fold. This result {{was caused by a}} very fast oxidation of reduced Trx by <b>ebselen</b> with a rate constant in excess of 2 × 107 M− 1 s− 1. This rate is orders of magnitude faster than the reaction of dithiol Trx with insulin disulfides. <b>Ebselen</b> competed with disulfide substrates for reduction by Trx and, therefore, acted as an inhibitor of protein disulfide reduction by the Trx system. The inherent H 2 O 2 reductase activity of mammalian TrxR dependent on its active-site selenocysteine residue was stimulated 10 -fold by 2 μM <b>ebselen</b> and 25 -fold in the additional presence of 5 μM Trx.

40|$|<b>Ebselen</b> is a seleno-organic {{compound}} {{currently in}} clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Its putative mode of action as a neuroprotectant is via cyclical reduction and oxidation reactions, in a manner akin to glutathione peroxidase. For this reason, we have investigated the effects of <b>ebselen</b> on the redox-sensitive NMDA receptor. We have found that <b>ebselen</b> readily reversed dithiothreitol (DTT) potentiation of NMDA-mediated currents in cultured neurons and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing wild-type NMDA NR 1 /NR 2 B receptors. In contrast, <b>ebselen</b> was unable to modulate NMDA-induced currents in neurons previously exposed to the thiol oxidant 5, 5 0 -dithio-bis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), or in CHO cells expressing a mutant receptor lacking the NR 1 redox modulatory site, suggesting that <b>ebselen</b> oxidizes the NMDA receptor via this site. In addition, <b>ebselen</b> was substantially less effective in modifying NMDA responses in neurons exposed to alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) following DTT treatment. <b>Ebselen</b> also reversed DTT block of carbachol-mediated currents in Cos- 7 cells expressing the a 2 bd 1 subunits of the acetylcholine receptor, an additional redox-sensitive ion channel. <b>Ebselen</b> was observed to signi®cantly increase cell viability following a 30 -min NMDA exposure in cultured neurons.

40|$|Lithium {{remains the}} gold {{standard}} in treating bipolar disorder but has unwanted toxicity and side effects. We previously reported that <b>ebselen</b> inhibits inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and exhibits lithium-like effects in animal models through lowering of inositol. <b>Ebselen</b> has been tested in clinical trials for other disorders, enabling us to determine {{for the first time}} the effect of a blood–brain barrier-penetrant IMPase inhibitor on human central nervous system (CNS) function. We now report that in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with healthy participants, acute oral <b>ebselen</b> reduced brain myo-inositol in the anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with CNS target engagement. <b>Ebselen</b> decreased slow-wave sleep and affected emotional processing by increasing recognition of some emotions, decreasing latency time in the acoustic startle paradigm, and decreasing the reinforcement of rewarding stimuli. In summary, <b>ebselen</b> affects the phosphoinositide cycle and has CNS effects on surrogate markers that may be relevant to the treatment of bipolar disorder that can be tested in future clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ebselen</b> is an organoselenium {{compound}} {{which has}} strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the neuroprotective role of <b>ebselen</b> pretreatment in rats with experimental sciatic nerve ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats {{were divided into}} four groups (N = 7 in each group). Before sciatic nerve I/R was induced, <b>ebselen</b> was injected intraperitoneally at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg. After a 2 h ischemia and a 3 h reperfusion period, sciatic nerve tissues were excised. Tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) were measured. Sciatic nerve tissues were also examined histopathologically. The 15 mg/kg dose of <b>ebselen</b> reduced sciatic nerve damage and apoptosis (P < 0. 01), levels of MDA, NO, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) positive cells (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, respectively), and increased SOD, GPx, and CAT activities (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, respectively) compared with the I/R group that did not receive <b>ebselen.</b> Conversely, the 30 mg/kg dose of <b>ebselen</b> increased sciatic nerve damage, apoptosis, iNOS positive cells (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 001) and MDA and NO levels (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01) and decreased SOD, GPx, and CAT activities (P < 0. 05) compared with the sham group. The {{results of this study}} suggest that <b>ebselen</b> may cause different effects depending on the dose employed. <b>Ebselen</b> may be protective against sciatic nerve I/R injury via antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities at a 15 mg/kg dose, conversely higher doses may cause detrimental effects. </p...|$|E
40|$|A revised {{mechanism}} {{that accounts for}} the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) -like catalytic activity of the organoselenium compound <b>ebselen</b> is described. It is shown that the reaction of <b>ebselen</b> with H 2 O 2 yields seleninic acid its the only oxidized product. The X-ray crystal structure of the seleninic acid shows that the selenium atom {{is involved in a}} noncovalent interaction with the carbonyl oxygen atom. In the presence of excess thiol, the Se-N bond in <b>ebselen</b> is readily cleaved by the thiol to produce the corresponding selenenyl sulfide. The selenenyl sulfide thus produced undergoes a disproportionation in the presence of H 2 O 2 to produce the diselenide, which upon reaction with H 2 O 2, produces it mixture of selenenic and seleninic acids. The addition of thiol to the Mixture containing selenenic and seleninic acids leads to the formation of the selenenyl sulfide. When the concentration of the thiol is relatively low in the reaction mixture, the selenenic acid undergoes a rapid cyclization to produce <b>ebselen.</b> The seleninic acid, on the other hand. reacts with the diselenide to produce <b>ebselen</b> as the final product. DFT calculations show that the cyclization of selenenic acids to the corresponding selenenyl amides is more favored than that of sulfenic acids to the corresponding sulfenyl amides. This indicates that the regeneration of <b>ebselen</b> under it variety of conditions protects the selenium moiety from irreversible inactivation, which may be responsible for the biological activities of <b>ebselen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Lithium {{remains the}} most {{effective}} treatment for bipolar disorder and also has important effects to lower suicidal behaviour, a property that {{may be linked to}} its ability to diminish impulsive, aggressive behaviour. The antioxidant drug, <b>ebselen,</b> has been proposed as a possible lithium-mimetic based on its ability in animals to inhibit inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), an action which it shares with lithium. Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether treatment with <b>ebselen</b> altered emotional processing and diminished measures of risk-taking behaviour. Methods: We studied 20 healthy participants who were tested on two occasions receiving either <b>ebselen</b> (3600  mg over 24  h) or identical placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Three hours after the final dose of ebselen/placebo, participants completed the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) and a task that required the detection of emotional facial expressions (facial emotion recognition task (FERT)). Results: On the CGT, relative to placebo, <b>ebselen</b> reduced delay aversion while on the FERT, it increased the recognition of positive vs negative facial expressions. Conclusions: The study suggests that at the dosage used, <b>ebselen</b> can decrease impulsivity and produce a positive bias in emotional processing. These findings have implications for the possible use of <b>ebselen</b> in the disorders characterized by impulsive behaviour and dysphoric mood...|$|E
40|$|Without a doubt, {{our current}} {{antimicrobials}} are losing {{the battle in}} the fight against newly-emerged multidrug-resistant pathogens. There is a pressing, unmet need for novel antimicrobials and novel approaches to develop them; however, it is becoming increasingly difficult and costly to develop new antimicrobials. One strategy to reduce the time and cost associated with antimicrobial innovation is drug repurposing, which is to find new applications outside the scope of the original medical indication of the drug. <b>Ebselen,</b> an organoselenium clinical molecule, possesses potent antimicrobial activity against clinical multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, but not against Gram-negative pathogens. Moreover, the activity of <b>ebselen</b> against Gram-positive pathogens exceeded those activities determined for vancomycin and linezolid, drugs of choice for treatment of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of <b>ebselen</b> at which 90 % of clinical isolates of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus were inhibited (MIC 90) were found to be 0. 5 and 0. 25 mg/L, respectively. <b>Ebselen</b> showed significant clearance of intracellular methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) in comparison to vancomycin and linezolid. We demonstrated that <b>ebselen</b> inhibits the bacterial translation process without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, <b>ebselen</b> was found to exhibit excellent activity in vivo in a Caenorhabditis elegans MRSA-infected whole animal model. Finally, <b>ebselen</b> showed synergistic activities with conventional antimicrobials against MRSA. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <b>ebselen,</b> with its potent antimicrobial activity and safety profiles, can be potentially used to treat multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections alone or in combination with other antibiotics and should be further clinically evaluated. © 2015 Thangamani et al.

40|$|It {{has been}} six decades since the {{discovery}} of lithium {{for the treatment of}} bipolar disorder. There is, as yet, no conclusive evidence as to how lithium produces this therapeutic effect, since it is known to interact with multiple cellular targets. One of the most credible targets is the enzyme, inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which plays a crucial role in cell signalling. My aim was to find a novel IMPase inhibitor and evaluate it as a possible lithium-like mood stabiliser by using enzyme, cell and whole animal experiments. To achieve this, I created recombinant human and mouse IMPase enzymes and then used these for screening and crystallisation. I used two different approaches for the small-molecule screening: substrate-based virtual screening and drug repositioning using a library of compounds with clinically proven safety. I identified <b>ebselen</b> as a novel IMPase inhibitor suitable for drug repositioning. I determined that <b>ebselen</b> inhibited IMPase noncompetitively, likely through a covalent modification on a cysteine. In cell cultures, <b>ebselen</b> was found to inhibit not just IMPase but other steps that resulted in accumulation of higher inositol phosphates. When injected intraperitoneally into mice, <b>ebselen</b> crossed the blood- brain barrier and exhibited inhibition of IMPase ex vivo. Moreover, in mice, <b>ebselen</b> simulates some, but not all, of the behavioural effects of lithium. I have determined that <b>ebselen</b> inhibits IMPase and acts as a partial lithium mimetic. Given that <b>ebselen</b> is safe in man, it warrants clinical testing for the treatment of bipolar disorder. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E
40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} induced X-ray emission (SRIXE) spectroscopy {{was used}} to map the cellular uptake of the organoselenium-based antioxidant drug <b>ebselen</b> using differentiated ND 15 cells as a neuronal model. The cellular SRIXE spectra, acquired using a hard X-ray microprobe beam (12. 8 -keV), showed a large enhancement of fluorescence at the K(α) line for Se (11. 2 -keV) following treatment with <b>ebselen</b> (10 μM) at time periods from 60 to 240 min. Drug uptake was quantified and <b>ebselen</b> was shown to induce time-dependent changes in cellular elemental content that were characteristic of oxidative stress with the efflux of K, Cl, and Ca species. The SRIXE cellular Se distribution map revealed that <b>ebselen</b> was predominantly localized to a discreet region of the cell which, by comparison with the K and P elemental maps, is postulated to correspond to the endoplasmic reticulum. On {{the basis of these}} findings, it is hypothesized that a major outcome of <b>ebselen</b> redox catalysis is the induction of cellular stress. A mechanism of action of <b>ebselen</b> is proposed that involves the cell responding to drug-induced stress by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that <b>ebselen</b> also regulated the homeostasis of the transition metals Mn, Cu, Fe, and Zn, with increases in transition metal uptake paralleling known induction times for the expression of antioxidant metalloenzymes.
