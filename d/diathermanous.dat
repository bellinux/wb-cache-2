60|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between {{the kitchen and}} the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous <b>diathermanous</b> ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

5000|$|Diathermancy (from [...] "dia" [...] {{through and}} [...] "thermÄ“" [...] heat) is the {{property}} of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A <b>diathermanous</b> fluid is thus [...] "permeable" [...] by heat.). Diathermancy was first described by German physicist and chemist Heinrich Magnus in the 1800s. Atmospheric air is diathermanous; therefore, air is not heated by sunshine, but by long wave heat reflected by soil, and especially, water on the Earth surface. Water, on the contrary, is not <b>diathermanous,</b> and it is heated by sunshine directly.|$|E
50|$|Sunshine {{heats up}} both water in rivers and land surface. However, water needs {{much more time}} to heating up than land does and {{atmosphere}} air is not heated by solar rays because it is <b>diathermanous.</b> It is heat coming up from soil and river waters, which in turn heat up the atmosphere. Therefore, difference of temperature between land and rivers is at its maximum at 10 a.m. (more or less). At that time, the land surface reflects heat to the atmosphere, making air ascend and condense, forming clouds, while water is still heating up and, thus, there is not outcoming heat to the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|A solar {{collector}} employing a porous matrix as a solar absorber and heat exchanger is presented and its application in solar air heaters is discussed. The collector {{is composed of}} a metallic matrix with a porous surface which acts as a large set of cavity radiators; cold air flows through the matrix plate and exchanges heat with the thermally stratified layers of the matrix. A steady-state thermal analysis of the collector is used to determine collector temperature distributions for the cases of an opaque surface matrix with total absorption of solar energy at the surface, and a <b>diathermanous</b> matrix with successive solar energy absorption at each depth. The theoretical performance of the porous flat plate collector is shown to exceed greatly that of a solid flat plate collector using air as the working medium for any given set of operational conditions. An experimental collector constructed using commercially available, low cost steel wool as the matrix {{has been found to}} have thermal efficiencies from 73 to 86 %...|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to accurately calculate the system entropy generation of mon-equilibrium state of open system by classic thermodynamics. A new definiton of entropy production pollution(EPP) is needed to be rebuilt about non-equilibrium state. By studing entropy production pollution definiton of whole system, It {{is very important to}} know the sources and parts of the system entropy pollution, which we can estimate the clean production position and optimize the system reaction design with environmental protection opinions. Based on the second law of thermodynamics about non-equilibrium state of open system, we open out that any open system contaminated by system entropy production and entropy flow items. Entropy flow is external to system entropy, and entropy production is system internal entropyeffect, which could indicate the system entropy of pollution intensity. It can derive the universal relevance of the entropy of the pollution load calculation model dS=deS+diS. According to analyze system entropy pollution production form and produce mechanism about single pipe <b>diathermanous</b> force heat transformation process a common development about entropy production can be put forward by these. All these researches is the basic researches for optimizing system design, reducing energy consuming and estimating system pollution state. This method is also useful to evaluate integrative characters with resource opinions...|$|E
