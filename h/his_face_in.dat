5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath {{as long as he}} possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> the episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house {{with one of the}} freed doves on her hand.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match involving wrestlers from the Raw brand, Rob Van Dam wrestled Kane under No disqualification regulations. The {{events leading up}} to this match began on the June 23, 2003 edition of Raw, when Kane took his mask off and exposed <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> front of RVD and the crowd after he lost to Triple H during a World Heavyweight Championship match. Then, on July 7, 2003, when Kane attacked Van Dam backstage during an episode of Raw. The following week on an episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff granted Van Dam a standard match against Kane, which took place the following week on Raw and ended in neither wrestler winning the match. On August 4, 2003, Shane McMahon, the son of Mr. McMahon, scheduled a No Disqualification match between the two wrestlers for SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where {{he was known as}} a practical joker who liked to hold a map in front of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Rathnavelu {{used the}} 435 Xtreme camera and also wrote a 1,600-page manual, {{in which he}} listed all of the {{possible}} angles from which the characters played by Rajinikanth could be filmed. Legacy Effects and the Hong Kong-based visual effects companies Kinomotive Studios and Menfond Electronics took responsibility for the film's CGI work. To create the robots with Rajinikanth's appearance, a complete scan of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> 3Ddigital format in all possible lighting conditions was conducted using the Doom Light Stage, so that his face could be replicated on the mannequins. The technique, according to Shankar, was previously used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). The robot Chitti featured in the film was a mannequin made by a Legacy Effects team of 100technicians in Los Angeles. For every robotic mannequin used, six puppeteers were employed to control the mannequin's movements.|$|E

5|$|Shawn Michaels {{returned}} on the June 12 {{episode of}} Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to re-form D-Generation X, turning Triple H into a fan favorite {{once again for}} the first time since 2002. DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match. They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks. They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match as directed by Mr. McMahon. At Unforgiven, D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match. During the match, DX embarrassed Vince by shoving <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> between Big Show's buttocks, and DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him.|$|E
5|$|Santos boxed for {{the vacant}} WBO light-middleweight title against Yori Boy Campas {{in a fight}} that took place at Bally's Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Santos won the fight when referee Joe Cortez intervened in the {{eleventh}} round. During {{the course of the}} fight numerous combinations hurt Campas and cut <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>in</b> the eleventh round following one of Santos' punches Campas informed Cortez that his vision was not functioning properly. At the moment of the fight's conclusion the scores of the judges were 99–91, 97–93 and 99–90 in favor of Santos. On August 17, 2002, Santos defended this championship for a first time against Mehrdud Takaloo, in a fight that also involved the World Boxing Union Light middleweight championship. The event took place in the Cardiff Castle located in Cardiff, Wales. Takaloo began the fight by using his right hand often and on the fourth round he scored a knockdown. As the fight progressed Takaloo began to show signs of exhaustion and Santos managed to have a strong performance {{in the second half of}} the fight. Takaloo received cuts around both of his eyes which made the referee consider stopping the fight twice in the tenth round. When the fight ended Santos won the contest by unanimous decision and the judges' scores were 116–111, 116–112, 117–110.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{was badly}} burned {{in a plane}} crash, trying to climb back into the plane to rescue a Frenchman.

25|$|Only {{a single}} Russian is shown with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the film, {{with the rest}} of the antagonists being faceless Soviets, {{particularly}} the helicopter. The original ending was created as a compromise resulting in a closing deadline and lack of funding, yet keeping the ending open. After the premiere, a new ending was filmed, which weaved the storyline better together. The second version also trimmed 10 minutes from the film's beginning.|$|E
25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Disguised as nobles, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce {{take the}} bodies of Kröd and Aneka to Dongalor, seeking the reward money. Dongalor tests whether Aneka is alive by rubbing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> her breasts and licking her face, which he declines to do for Kröd's body. However, Kröd starts to wake up and, having missed {{sleeping}} with Aneka, starts to spoon her still unconscious body. Dongalor orders his guards to kill Kröd but, seeing how weak and disoriented he is from the potion, opts to do so himself and begins taunting Kröd, planning to torture him by killing the still-unconscious Aneka, and then Krӧd. However, a mysterious man (James Murray) swings through a nearby window, knocks Dongalor and Barnabus away, saving Kröd and Aneka, who are dragged {{out of the room}} by their friends to safety.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into a hat, and put <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, {{and when it was}} written down and repeated to Brother Joseph {{to see if it was}} correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{based in part}} on what was said to be information obtained miraculously from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones, including his favorite, a brown stone he found during excavation of a neighbor's well. He initially used these stones in various treasure-digging quests in the early 1820s, placing the stone in the bottom of his hat and putting <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the hat to read what he believed were the miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said that he had access to a separate set of spectacles composed of seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim. He said that, through these stones, he could translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

Lilly was indifferent to his own appearance, and his collar was a rag.|$|R
25|$|Registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) {{begins a}} rivalry with Dan after he {{undermines}} {{him over the}} treatment of a patient. Tensions build when he learns that Malick is gay. He secretly treats his injured rugby team mate Sean Foster (Sam Callis) with steroids. Malick and Chrissie criticise his actions and Malick threatens to report him. Sean develops necrotizing fasciitis as a result and Dan is forced to operate, ruining Sean's career. A fight ensues between the two and Dan kisses Malick. He then runs to Chrissie and confesses his love for her. Dan asks Malick to forget the kiss and attempts to avoid him. They are forced to operate together. Dan undermines him in theatre, the pair fight once more. After more competitiveness, Dan ignores Malick's medical advice dangering a patient. Malick is angered by his attitude and punches Dan, injuring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E
25|$|From one rivalry to the other, it {{had been}} {{simmering}} for some time between Mick Foley and Randy Orton. In June 2003, following an on-air ceremony honoring Foley for his achievements, Orton and Ric Flair attacked him backstage and threw him {{down a flight of}} stairs. In December 2003, Foley returned as the replacement for Steve Austin as Raw co-general manager and gave himself a shot at Orton's Intercontinental Championship, but {{he walked out of the}} match and would not face Orton even after the champion spat on <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> January 2004, a furious Austin declared that Foley would be entered in the Royal Rumble match and he expected him to return and wrestle, which he did by eliminating Orton (and himself) from the match. Foley was later joined by The Rock in the feud, and the reformed Rock 'n' Sock Connection challenged Orton, Batista, and Flair to a handicap tag team match at WrestleMania.|$|E
25|$|This {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by Creangă's rendition of interactions between his father, depicted as aloof and moody, but often amused by his boy's misbehaving, and his mother, who supervises the children directly and criticizes Ștefan for not following her lead. Indicating that he deserved the often severe punishments applied by his parents, the narrator then details his mischievousness and antics. He recounts his participation in the customs related to Saint Basil's feast (modern New Year's Day), fashioning a pig's bladder into a rattle and joining buhai players in celebrations as noisy as to irritate the settled villagers. The story also shows Nică greedily consuming all the milk his mother leaves out for souring and trying to {{blame it on the}} strigoi spirits, or bothering Chiorpec the shoemaker {{to the point where the}} aging man would punish him by covering <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> terpene. In summer, the boy plans a ruse to steal cherries from his uncle's property, and makes his way into the orchard by pretending to be looking for a cousin. Caught red-handed by his aunt and chased by her through a hemp plot, he manages to escape when she gets tangled in the plants.|$|E
