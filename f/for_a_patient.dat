5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> to feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E

5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume necessary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion {{is used in}} urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E
50|$|In health care, a {{clinical}} trial is a comparison test of a medication or other medical treatment (such as a medical device), versus a placebo (inactive look-alike), other medications or devices, or the standard medical treatment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> condition.|$|R
30|$|Despite being infrequent, an {{awareness}} of these mimics is important.

25|$|Finally, {{in order}} to {{activate}} the extrinsic / tissue factor clotting cascade pathway, tissue factor (also known as factor III) is added and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples.

25|$|For {{decades the}} New Deal was {{generally}} held in very high regard in the scholarship and the textbooks. That {{changed in the}} 1960s when New Left historians began a revisionist critique that said the New Deal was a bandaid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> that needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place, and lift up workers, women and minorities. The New Left believed in participatory democracy and therefore rejected the autocratic machine politics typical of the big city Democratic organizations.|$|E
25|$|The {{motives of}} the patient can vary: <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with {{factitious}} disorder, the primary aim is to obtain sympathy, nurturance, and attention accompanying the sick role. This {{is in contrast to}} malingering, in which the patient wishes to obtain external gains such as disability payments or to avoid an unpleasant situation, such as military duty. Factitious disorder and malingering cannot be diagnosed in the same patient, and the diagnosis of factitious disorder depends on the absence of any other psychiatric disorder. While they are both listed in the DSM-IV-TR, factitious disorder is considered a mental disorder, while malingering is not.|$|E
25|$|Secondary care medical {{services}} {{are provided by}} medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency rooms, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.|$|E

25|$|Those who {{disagree}} with the AMA point {{to the case of}} Nosrat Khajavi. In 1996, Khajavi, an anesthesiologist in Yuba City, California, disagreed with a surgeon over the appropriateness of cataract surgery <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> and refused to attend during the procedure. Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business & Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care. The court did not rule on the merits of the dispute.|$|E
25|$|The MBBS course {{starts with}} the basic pre and para-clinical {{subjects}} such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five long years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and Complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{and what are the}} best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management and thorough counselling skills.|$|E
25|$|Another typical {{disorder}} where {{auditory hallucinations}} are very common is dissociative identity disorder. In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming {{from outside the}} person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head not behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations. However, many people not suffering from diagnosable mental illness may sometimes hear voices as well. One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, {{it is crucial to}} take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, he/she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as Wilson's disease, various endocrine diseases, numerous metabolic disturbances, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and many others can present with psychosis.|$|E
5000|$|While {{assisted}} suicide remains illegal in the United Kingdom, {{it is not}} uncommon <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> death to be hastened and for there to be no legal ramifications attached to the physician that caused the death. Indeed, Lord Goff ruled in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland that doctors who intentionally do everything necessary and appropriate to relieve <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> pain and suffering, even with the foresight of possible terminal consequences, are considered legally protected when a death is hastened.|$|R
50|$|Calculating drug dosages for {{treatment}} for more serious diseases like cancer is commonly done through measuring the Body Surface Area of the patient. There are approximately 25 different formulae <b>for</b> measuring <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> body surface area, {{none of them}} exact. See also Body surface area. Because {{of the variety of}} methods to select when determining <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> body surface area, studies show that choosing the best method <b>for</b> <b>an</b> individual <b>patient</b> is <b>a</b> difficult task, and often <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> receives {{too much or too little}} medication based on physical anomalies that don’t necessarily fit perfectly with the portfolio of the body surface area.|$|R
