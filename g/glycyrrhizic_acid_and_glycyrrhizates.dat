By changing the different extraction solvents, procedures, times and temperature, the optimum extraction condition was established: the used of ethanol/water (30 : 70, v/v) as an extraction solvent, and 60 min dipping time under 50 °C. The extracts of licorice were separated and determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a methanol/water (70 : 30, v/v, containing 1 % acetic acid) as the mobile phase. Under the optimum extraction condition, 2. 39 mg/g of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> 0. 92 mg/g of glabridin were extracted from Chinese licorice and the recoveries were 89. 7 % and 72. 5 % respectively...|$|R

40|$|Shaoyao-Gancao (Paeoniae Radix Alba and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) is a {{traditional}} Chinese drug pair widely used in decoctions for relieving pains, especially abdominal pain. We aimed to determine the intestinal absorption and interaction of three active compounds (<b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid,</b> liquiritin, <b>and</b> paeoniflorin) in this drug pair. We investigated the transport of these compounds across intestinal epithelial cells by using the Caco- 2 cell monolayer in both the apical-to-basolateral (A-B) and B-A directions. All compounds could only travel through the Caco- 2 cell monolayer at a low level when the cells were treated with single component solutions. In the presence of verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the absorptive permeability (PAB) of paeoniflorin and liquiritin increased significantly (p &lt; 0. 05) and efflux ratios decreased, while the absorption of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> did not change significantly, which indicated that paeoniflorin and liquiritin might be P-gp substrates. In addition, when liquiritin <b>and</b> <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> in Gancao extract and paeoniflorin in Shaoyao extract were examined, PAB of paeoniflorin and liquiritin were significantly higher, while <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> retained the same absorption level compared to the corresponding single component solutions, which suggested that some certain ingredients in the extracts can promote the absorption of paeoniflorin and liquiritin, but not that of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid.</b> Furthermore, compared {{to the results of}} treatment with individual extracts, treatment of cells with a mixture of the two extracts considerably increased (p &lt; 0. 05) the absorption of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> paeoniflorin and showed no change in the absorption of liquiritin, which implied that the transport of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> paeoniflorin is increased by some ingredients from the complementary drug in the drug pair, while that of liquiritin remains unaffected...|$|R

Root <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content of plants treated in June increased significantly compared with controls, and the difference was significant. As for plants treated in July, root <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content increased in which sprayed with appropriate concentrations of hormones, but the effects of hormones were more evident in plants treated in June coincided with the vigorous growth period than those treated in July. Gibberellin at 40 mg/l and auxin at 40 mg/l applied in the two treatment periods significantly promoted the accumulation of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> in G. uralensis root.

Furthermore, the inhibition kinetic type and parameters were determined for the inhibition of glycyrrhetinic acid towards UGT 1 A 3 and UGT 2 B 7. Data fitting using Dixon and Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that the inhibition of UGT 1 A 3 and UGT 2 B 7 by glycyrrhetinic acid was best fit to competitive and noncompetitive type, respectively. The second plot using the slopes from Lineweaver-Burk plots versus glycyrrhetinic acid concentrations was employed to calculate the inhibition kinetic parameters (K-i), and the values were calculated to be 0. 2 and 1. 7 M for UGT 1 A 3 and UGT 2 B 7, respectively. All these results remind us the possibility of UGT inhibition-based herb-drug interaction. However, the explanation of these in vitro parameters should be paid more caution due to complicated factors, including the probe substrate-dependent UGT inhibition behaviour, environmental factors affecting the abundance of herbs' ingredients, and individual difference of pharmacokinetic factors.

GA and glabridin significantly accelerated cell migration through wound healing in both 3 T 3 -L 1 and NIH- 3 T 3 and significantly down regulated the expression of CXC chemokine ligand 5 in 3 T 3 -L 1 at concentration 1  ×  10 − 8  mol/L, indicating the possible involvement of nuclear factor-κB and cyclooxygenase 2 transcriptions modulation. Conclusions: Both GA and glabridin can serve as potential treatment for chronic inflammatory disease, and glabridin as an oncogenic inhibitor due to its anti-proliferative property...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{eosinophil}} cationic protein (ECP) is cytotoxic to bacteria, viruses, parasites and mammalian cells. Cells are damaged via {{processes of}} pore formation, permeability alteration and membrane leaking. Some clinical studies indicate that ECP gathers in the bronchial tract of asthma sufferers, damages bronchial and airway epithelial cells, and leads to in breathing tract inflammation; therefore, prevention of the cytotoxicity caused by ECP may serve as an approach to treat airway inflammation. To achieve the purpose, reduction of the ECP-cell interactions is rational. In this work, the Chinese herbal combinative network was generated to predict and identify the functional herbs from the pools of prescriptions. It was useful to select the node herbs and to demonstrate the relative binding ability between ECP and Beas- 2 B cells with or withour herb treatments. Results Eighty three Chinese herbs and prescriptions were tested and five effective herbs and six prescription candidates were selected. On the basis of effective single-herbal drugs and prescriptions, a combinative network was generated. We found that a single herb, Gan-cao, served as a node connecting five prescriptions. In addition, Sheng-di-huang, Dang-guei and Mu-tong also appeared in five, four and three kinds of prescriptions, respectively. The extracts of these three herbs indeed effectively inhibited the interactions between ECP and Beas- 2 B cells. According to the Chinese herbal combinative network, eight of the effective herbal extracts showed inhibitory effects for ECP internalizing into Beas- 2 B cells. The major components of Gang-cao <b>and</b> Sheng-di-huang, <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> verbascose, respectively, reduced the binding affinity between ECP and cells effectively. Conclusions Since these Chinese herbs reduced the binding affinity between ECP and cells and inhibited subsequent ECP entrance into cells, they were potential for mitigating the airway inflammation symptoms. Additionally, we mentioned {{a new concept to}} study the Chinese herbs using combinative network in the field of systems biology. The functional single herbs could be identified from the set of prescriptions. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) <b>and</b> {{licorice}} flavonoids (LF) are the {{two classes}} of bioactive components in licorice with known pharmacological effects. But long-term excessive intake of GA may cause sodium retention and hypertension. In this study, the performance and adsorption characteristics of four widely used macroporous resins for the separation of deglycyrrhizinated, flavonoids enriched licorice has been critically evaluated. The sorption and desorption properties of LF and GA on macroporous resins including XDA- 1, LSA- 10, D 101 and LSA- 20 have been compared. The adsorption capacity was found to depend strongly on the pH of the feed solution. XDA- 1 offers much higher adsorption capacity for GA and LF than other resins, and its adsorption data fit the best to the Freundlich isotherm. XDA- 1 also shows much higher adsorption affinity towards LF than that of GA based on calculated results from the measured adsorption isotherms. Dynamic adsorption and desorption experiments {{have been carried out}} on a XDA- 1 resin packed column to obtain optimal parameters for separating GA and LF An enriched LF extract (about 21. 9 % purity) free of GA, and an enriched GA extract with 66 % purity can be separated from crude licorice extract in one run.

40|$|Lipase inhibitors have {{generated}} a great interest {{because they could}} help in the prevention or the therapy of lipase-related diseases. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} work was to evaluate by HPLC, and using Candida rugosa lipase as model, the inhibitory effect of several saponins: beta-aescin, digitonin, <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) <b>and</b> Quillaja saponin (QS); flavonoids: 3 -hydroxyflavone, 5 -hydroxyflavone, (+) -catechin and kaempferol; and alkaloids: aspidospermine, papaverine, physostigmine, pilocarpine, raubasine, rescinnamine, reserpine and trigonelline. The inhibition produced by most of these compounds is described here for the first time. Saponins appeared very active, being beta-aescin and digitonin the most active compounds (IC 50 = 0. 8 - 2. 4 x 10 (- 5) M). The inhibitory activity of flavonoids was lower than that of saponins (except GA), and (+) -catechin and kaempferol were the most active. Alkaloids was the most heterogeneous group assayed, varying from rescinnamine, with an IC 16 similar to that of digitonin, to papaverine and others which showed almost no inhibition. In conclusion, beta-aescin, digitonin, kaempferol or (+) -catechin, strong lipase inhibitors with a low toxicity and present herbal drugs used for lipase-related diseases such as acne or ulcer, are promising candidates for the prevention or the treatment of these diseases.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) <b>and</b> assess its immunomo-dulatory potential in a model of experimental visceral leishmaniasis. Methods: The antileishmanial activity of GA was tested in an amastigote–macrophage model and its non-cytotoxic dose was measured by a cell viability assay. To understand the effector mechanism of GA-treated macrophages against leishmanial parasites, real-time PCR analysis of inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (iNOS 2) was carried out followed by measurement of nitric oxide generation by Griess reagent. The effect of GA on the production of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) - 12, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a, IL- 10 and trans-forming growth factor (TGF) -b, was measured by ELISA (protein) and real-time PCR. The expression of iNOS 2 and cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2) was studied by western blotting. The parasite burden of the liver and spleen following GA treatment was determined by the stamp-smear method, and T cell proliferation was assessed via [3 H]thymidine uptake, measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Results: Results showed that GA treatment caused an enhanced expression of iNOS 2 along with inhibition of Cox- 2 in Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages. GA treatment in infected macrophages enhanced the expression of IL- 12 and TNF-a, concomitant with a down-regulation of IL- 10 and TGF-b.

40|$|<b>Glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA) <b>and</b> 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic <b>acid</b> (18 beta GA) are the {{bioactive}} compounds of licorice. The neuroprotective {{effects of}} GA and 18 beta GA against serum/glucose deprivation and 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -induced cytotoxicity in PC 12 cells were investigated. The intracellular {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) content, {{the activity of the}} antioxidant enzymes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio were determined. PI 3 K/Akt pathway signaling was also evaluated to study the possible protective mechanism. The results showed that GA treatment decreased the ROS content by elevating the activities of GPx and catalase, leading to a decreased MMP. GA and 18 beta GA also lowered the mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio and activated PI 3 K/Akt signal. The results suggest that GA may protect PC 12 cells from ischemic injury via modulation of the intracellular antioxidant system and mitochondria-induced apoptosis. Moreover, GA and 18 beta GA may modulate the ratio of the mitochondrial Bcl- 2 family and influence PI 3 K/Akt signaling. These results demonstrate the neuroprotective ability of GA and 18 beta GA and suggest that the cytotoxicity of 6 -OHDA may influence the mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio without altering the expression of Bax.

40|$|Introduction. Licorice or {{liquorice}} (Glycyrrhiza glabra, Leguminosae) is {{a perennial}} plant naturally occurring or cultivated in Europe and Asia. It was appreciated by many ancient cultures, and was employed within Arabic medicine and (beginning in the Middle Ages) in Europe folk medicine as {{a remedy for}} many diseases. Currently, the sweet flavoured root of this plant – Radix Glycyrrhizae (Liquirtiae), is widely taken for the treating of various upper respiratory tract diseases, {{as well as for}} gastric ulcer disease. It is also utilized as a sweetening and flavouring agent in the food, tobacco and pharmacy industries. The main active ingredient of liquorice is the triterpenoid saponin, glycyrrhizin, which is a mixture of calcium, magnesium and potassium salts of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> (GA). <b>Glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> is composed of an aglycone, that is 18 β-glycyrrhetinic <b>acid</b> (GE), <b>and</b> a D-glucuronic <b>acid</b> dimer.
