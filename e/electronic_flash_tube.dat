50|$|A typical <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> {{unit has}} <b>electronic</b> {{circuitry}} to charge a high-capacity capacitor {{to several hundred}} volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a <b>flash</b> <b>tube,</b> producing a <b>flash</b> of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the flash duration, often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of full flash brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach full brightness; <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> does not have these difficulties.|$|R

40|$|A large solid iron {{spectrograph}} {{is described}} {{which will be}} used initially to measure the vertical spectrum and charge ratio of cosmic ray muons to momenta in excess of 5000 GeV/c. Scintillation counters and trays of digitised neon <b>flash</b> <b>tubes</b> are used as particle detectors and the spectrograph is connected to an I. B.

The spectrograph has an acceptance of 818 cm(^ 2) ster. and an estimated maximum detectable momentum of approximately 6000 Gev/c. A momentum selector is incorporated in the spectrograph equipment which selects, for further analysis by the computer, particles with momenta above a few hundred GeV/c from the information contained in trays of digitised <b>flash</b> <b>tubes</b> situated at: three levels in the spectrograph. The computer calculates the momenta of particles selected in this way using the data contained in a further five trays of digitised <b>flash</b> <b>tubes.</b> A <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> digitisation technique has been developed for use in the spectrograph and is described in detail. The technique utilises a simple probe {{on the front of the}} <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> to detect an electrical pulse when the tube discharges. The pulse is fed into an electronic memory for the <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> made from integrated circuit logic elements. The electronic circuits used for the <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> data recording, the momentum selector, and the logic controlling the readout of data from the <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> trays to the computer are described.

40|$|A review {{has been}} made of the {{development}} of the neon <b>flash</b> <b>tube,</b> from its introduction by Conversi in 1955, up to the present day. Particular attention is paid to the problems which arose from attempts to use <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> arrays on accelerator experiments, namely the long sensitive and recovery times of the tubes, and the loss of efficiency at high event rates, caused by internal clearing fields. The problems arising from attempts to describe analytically the <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> discharge mechanism are also discussed. An investigation of the decay mechanisn of the internal clearing fields {{has been made}}, which indicated that the effect may be overcome by decreasing the surface resistance of the outer wall of the <b>flash</b> <b>tube.</b> A description of a gamma ray detector, utilising <b>flash</b> <b>tubes</b> as the detecting elements, interspersed with lead absorber, is included.

40|$|A {{search for}} {{particles}} carrying an electric charge one third {{that of the}} electronic charge (quarks) {{has been carried out}} close to the core of extensive air showers. The search was conducted at sea-level using a large volume <b>flash</b> <b>tube</b> chamber. The technique employed utilised these nativity of <b>flash</b> <b>tubes</b> to particle ionisation. Air showers were selected by requiring the local electron density above the detector to exceed 40 m (^- 40) with this trigger the apparatus has been operated for 2570 hours. No definite quark tracks have been observed, the upper limit on the quark flux being set at 8. 0 x 10 (^- 11) cm (^- 2) sec (^- 1) st (^- 1). In the same experiment, the energy spectra of charged and neutral nuclear-active particles in extensive air showers of mean shower size 2. 0 x ` 0 (^ 5) has been measured. A method has been developed for estimating the energies of the particles from the width of the nuclear-electromagnetic cascade resulting from the interactions, as measured in <b>flash</b> <b>tubes</b> below the absorbers.
