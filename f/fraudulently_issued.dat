500|$|A few of {{the holders}} of Wentworth grants were {{originally}} from northwestern Connecticut; and some of them, including Remember Baker and Seth Warner, were relatives of Allen. In 1770, a group of Wentworth grant holders asked Allen to defend their case before New York's Supreme Court, a move that presented Allen with his first big stage. This move to leadership was not unusual; he was known among his contemporaries {{to be willing to}} step forward and take control. The trial, for which Allen hired Jared Ingersoll to represent the grantholder interest, began in July 1770, pitting Allen against politically powerful New York grant-holders, including New York's Lieutenant Governor Colden, James Duane (who was prosecuting the case), and Robert Livingston, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (who was presiding over the case). The trial was brief, and the outcome unsurprising, as the court, citing their <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issued</b> nature, refused to allow the introduction of Wentworth's grants as evidence. Before departing for Bennington with the news, Allen was visited by Duane, who offered Allen payments which Duane described in his diary as payment [...] "for going among the people to quiet them". Allen denied taking any money; even if he did, none of his actions appeared to honor Duane's request. According to Allen's account he was outraged, and left his visitors with veiled threats, indicating that attempts to enforce the judgment would be met with resistance.|$|E

50|$|Threats include fires, {{illegal logging}} and {{the advance of}} {{agriculture}} around the park.As of 2005 about 3.7% of the park had been deforested, of which 19 km2 had been deforested before creation in 1997, and 25 km2 had been deforested since then..In 2010 a scheme was uncovered where <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issued</b> titles for land in the park issued by the Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (Incra) were being sold to farmers, who would then claim compensation.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{generally}} used by people {{on vacation in}} foreign countries instead of cash, as many businesses used to accept traveler's checks as currency. The incentive for merchants and other parties to accept them lay {{in the fact that}} as long as the original signature (which the buyer is supposed to place on the check in ink as soon as they receive the check) and the signature made at the time the check is used is the same, the checks issuer will unconditionally guarantee payment of the face amount even if the check was <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issued,</b> stolen, or lost. This means that a traveler's check can never 'bounce' unless the issuer goes bankrupt and out of business. If a traveler's check were lost or stolen, it could be replaced by the issuing financial institution.|$|E
50|$|Asian crime rings, foreign logging companies, {{and foreign}} {{businessmen}} arrange {{for some women}} to voluntarily enter Papua New Guinea with <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issued</b> tourist or business visas. Subsequent to their arrival, the smugglers turn {{many of the women}} over to traffickers who transport them to logging and mining camps, fisheries, and entertainment sites where they are exploited in forced prostitution and involuntary domestic servitude. Foreign and local men are exploited for labor at mines and logging camps, where some receive almost no pay and are compelled to continue working for the company indefinitely through debt bondage schemes. Employers foster workers’ greater indebtedness to the company by paying the workers sub-standard wages while charging them artificially inflated prices at the company store; employees’ only option becomes to buy food and other necessities on credit. Government officials facilitate trafficking by accepting bribes to allow illegal migrants to enter the country or to ignore victims forced into prostitution or labor, by receiving female trafficking victims in return for political favors, and by providing female victims in return for votes.|$|E

5000|$|A {{group of}} DC {{government}} employees had embezzled funds by <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issuing</b> {{real estate tax}} refund checks to their friends. BDO Seidman was the independent auditor of the DC government's financial records. On November 21, 2007 Reuters wrote “Washington, D.C., officials should fix problems identified in an audit that found the city mishandled millions of dollars, according to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the U.S. capital in Congress…. The audit, conducted by accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP, found that financial reporting for the city's school system and Medicaid programs did not match their financial statements, making both areas vulnerable to fraud….Altogether, auditors found more than 160 instances where the city failed to comply with conditions for spending federal money, primarily by misreporting funds and mismanaging cash." [...] As of November 2007, {{it was estimated that}} over $30 million were scammed by Washington, DC tax officials since 1999. At the height of the scam, half of the property tax refund checks were fraudulent. The average legitimate check was less than $10,000 while the average scam check was over $300,000. [...] "The scandal may also singe BDO Seidman, a private audit firm that gave DC CFO Natwar Gandhi its seal of approval earlier this year. Its auditors were paid millions to go over the city’s books and gave Gandhi’s office an unqualified opinion." [...] In 2010, a mentally ill woman, who was not a DC employee was able to exploit a security loophole in DC's financial systems to file tax returns claiming $19.1 million in refunds, but these were stopped.|$|R

5000|$|Lenders {{typically}} require {{access to}} the borrower's credit report before issuing a loan in the borrower's name. If lenders cannot see the borrower's credit report, it is unlikely the lender will issue a loan in the borrower's name. Hence, credit freezing should reduce the risk that loans or credit cards will be <b>issued</b> <b>fraudulently.</b> Credit freezes do have some disadvantages, however, such as creating potential difficulties or delays applying for a loan.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Qatar made minimal {{efforts to}} {{investigate}} and prosecute trafficking offenses during the reporting period. Qatar does not prohibit all acts of trafficking, but it criminalizes slavery under Section 321 and forced labor under Section 322 of its criminal Law. The prescribed penalty for forced labor - up to six months’ imprisonment - is not sufficiently stringent. Article 297 prohibits forced or coerced prostitution, and the prostitution of a child below age 15, {{even if there was}} no compulsion or redress; the prescribed penalty is up to 15 years’ imprisonment, which is commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government has yet to enact a comprehensive trafficking law as anticipated during the last year, though it has reaffirmed its commitment to do so over the coming year, a commitment underscored by its ratification of the 2000 UN TIP Protocol in April 2009. The government reported the prosecution of sex trafficking offenders, but did not provide additional details. An unconfirmed report indicated four traffickers were charged with <b>fraudulently</b> <b>issuing</b> visas to workers who they then exploited. Two were reportedly deported, and two were reportedly convicted. The government neither confirmed nor denied the existence of this case. The government-established but independent Qatar Foundation for Combating Human Trafficking (QFCHT) and the Human Rights Office of the Ministry of Interior conducted a workshop on the legal, social, and security dimensions of trafficking. Participants included police officers, Internal Security Force staff, and others. The police academy trained police officers on the identification of trafficking victims and procedures to refer victims to Qatar’s trafficking shelter. QFCHT also provided training for prosecutors and judges on how to manage trafficking cases.|$|R
50|$|In November 1999, Palazzolo {{was arrested}} in {{connection}} with fraud and forgery charges relating to his South African citizenship. Home affairs officials discovered that it was <b>issued</b> <b>fraudulently.</b> He was released on a 500,000 rand bail, but re-arrested at his Bantry Bay home in Cape Town in March 2000. In March 2003, he was acquitted of contravening South African law when applying for citizenship in 1994. The judge criticised the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for wasting the court's time with cases they could never win.|$|R
50|$|On September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown {{was awarded}} {{guardianship}} of the girl. During this time, there were disputes {{with the insurance}} company Ruth Snyder had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth US$30,000, was paid out without contest, they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000, respectively (the three combined policies worth $ million today). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 {{for the maintenance of}} Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected as they had been <b>issued</b> <b>fraudulently.</b> At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Snyder and Brown asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record, on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930 it was finally ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid.|$|R
40|$|When {{management}} {{is faced with}} the need to report increased earnings, possible responses range from <b>issuing</b> <b>fraudulently</b> overstated financial statements to adopting more aggressive accounting methods (Jiambalvo 1996). This dissertation examines benefits that may prompt management to choose fraud rather than legitimate earnings management methods. To test the hypotheses, a sample of 60 firms that increased income via fraud is compared to a sample of 178 firms from the same industries as the fraud firms, but these “GAAP” firms chose to increase earnings via a legitimate change in an accounting method. ^ Findings of the study were that fraud caused a significantly larger increase in income than GAAP changes did, and that fraud was significantly more likely to increase gross profit. The fraud firms also had significantly fewer opportunities to make income-increasing GAAP changes, although this was not significant in the logit analysis. Contrary to expectations, the GAAP changes made by fraud firms in the preceding three years were neither more numerous nor more income-increasing than the GAAP changes made by the GAAP firms. ^ This is the first study to compare fraud versus legitimate means of achieving increases in reported earnings. The results have theoretical as well as practical implications. For example, an issue important to earnings management theory concerns whether firms choose fraud to avoid the disclosure required for a GAAP change. At the time of the fraud, 25 of the 60 fraud firms had an income-increasing GAAP option available to them, but none of these options were capable of producing a particularly large income effect. This may suggest that effect size is at least as important as avoidance of disclosure. Another interesting result is the fact that, when an alternative GAAP method existed, both fraud firms and GAAP firms used the most aggressive alternative about 80...|$|R
