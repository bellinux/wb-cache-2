Crushed glass, grinding wheels (SiC), <b>hard</b> <b>metals</b> <b>plates,</b> {{high speed steel}} and cast iron chips as well as marble powders were used in automatic overlay welding of steel by low carbon wire. Powder spread over the steel surface and melted by continuously supplied wire arc enabled to obtain layers with graphite and carbides inclusions in the matrix; hardness of the matrix depends on the phases contained in it: martensite, troostite and residual austenite as well as secondary carbides. Depending on materials used for overlay welding the layers were obtained which abrasive wear resistance became {{equal to that of}} high alloyed hardened tool steel.

30|$|Some {{representatives of}} per- and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are highly stable organic compounds, {{due to the}} C–F bond {{being one of the}} strongest in organic chemistry [1]. Compared to hydrocarbons, PFASs have enhanced technical properties, such as a higher surface activity and better dielectric properties, and possess {{at the same time a}} higher thermal stability, an increased chemical resistance and a physiological inertness [2]. Due to these properties, PFASs are well suited for manifold applications and have been used extensively in various industrial and consumer applications since the 1950 s, e.g., impregnation of textiles, paper, <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> <b>plating,</b> in paints, the production of fluoropolymers, etc. [3, 4]. During the production and life cycle of the products, a certain fraction of PFASs is inevitably emitted into the environment (e.g., [5]). Many commonly used PFASs can degrade under environmentally relevant conditions to perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), regarded as final degradation products (e.g., [6]). Besides the direct emission of PFAAs, e.g., from production and life cycle of certain fluoropolymers, indirect emissions via degradation of the precursor substances are of high relevance regarding the global emissions [7]. Also, side-chain fluorinated polymers, in particular the group of side-chain fluorotelomer-based polymers, were shown to be degraded to PFAAs under environmental conditions in the range of decades to centuries [8] and are therefore considered to be precursors. As highly persistent final degradation products of many other PFASs, PFAAs are a relevant group regarding environmental and human exposure, even though being a small substance group within the whole PFASs group, consisting of at least 3000 substances [9].|$|R

40|$|Properties of {{fragment}} clouds {{produced by}} hypervelocity perforation of <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> have been experimentally investigated. Replica model techniques have been applied. Targets consisted of steel dual-plate systems. Projectilies were <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> spheres of tungsten carbide (3 mm, 7 mm and 10 mm diameter, HRc 79) and steel spheres (6 mm and 12 mm diameter, HRc 63) at velocities ranging between 2. 3 km/s and 4. 5 km/s. Cloud expansion velocities have been measured {{by means of}} in-flight flash X-ray photograph series. Maximum and minimum fragment velocities at front and rear side of clouds have been determined. From impact crater patterns on witness plates, and X-ray photographs of debris clouds, projectile and shield fragments have been identified.

For the 3 mm diameter <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> spheres only the maximum debris cloud ve locity v sub rmax scales; all other parameters show deviations, indicating non-uniformity of the plate perforation process at different plate thicknesses. The shape of the inner part of debris clouds of steel spheres is different from that of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> spheres, caused by the density difference. For steel spheres the debris cloud shape is a convex lense, the shape of the <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> fragments becomes in the rear nearly hemispherical.

50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the <b>metal</b> <b>plate).</b> This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|R

The <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> which were P- 20 with the size of 306 x 130 mm 2 were used. <b>Metal</b> <b>plate</b> was gouged to a depth of 3 mm for installing the CLOHP. Distances from the heating device to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> surface were 5 and 10 mm. The surface temperatures of the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> were controlled at 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C. Sixteen pointa of temperature were recorded.

Once the system entered the steady state, {{it was found that the}} temperature distribution of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using the CLOHP has a deviation in the range of ± 1. 00 °C and ± 0. 94 °C at the CLOHP depth of 5 mm. and 10 mm., respectively.
