5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>the</b> idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of Heaven.|$|E

25|$|The most absurd {{part of this}} absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has {{received}} comparatively little comment. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> {{point at which the}} Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, 'These are my authority'.

500|$|Oosterbaan {{resigned}} {{as the head}} football coach in 1958. [...] At the time, he said: [...] "The pressure finally got to me. [...] Not the kind that comes from outside. [...] Not from my bosses or the fans. [...] <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> pressure that builds up inside a head coach whether he wins or loses." [...] After Oosterbaan quit as football coach he was succeeded by Bump Elliott. [...] In 1959, Oosterbaan became Michigan's director of athletic alumni relations and held that position until he retired in 1972.|$|E
500|$|The present-tense {{relationship}} between Alvy and Annie {{was not the}} narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film [...] "in the direction of that relationship." [...] Rosenblum recalled that Allen [...] "had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes {{in order to establish}} Keaton more quickly." [...] According to Allen, [...] "I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it." ...|$|E

Sex. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>the</b> physical activity. Coitus. Do you like it? You're not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love". David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine noted undeniable similarities between this spoken section and a similar quote by actress Julianne Moore in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. In May 2014, during an interview with Vanity Fair, Lewinsky addressed the lyrics of the song mentioning her, saying, [...] "Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clinton'd all on my gown'".|$|E

500|$|On February23, 2010, {{the album}} was previewed in its {{entirety}} during a private listening party at Gramercy Park Hotel's Rose Bar in New York City. Craig Kallman, Chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records, delivered a speech praising {{the members of the}} band and their influence on the music industry, comparing them to Led Zeppelin. Several members of the audience described the songs as [...] "Beatles-esque" [...] and the album [...] "a natural, melodic progression for Stone Temple Pilots." [...] Robert DeLeo cautioned against the overuse of the [...] "Beatles" [...] label. [...] "I think there's {{always going to be a}} sense of Beatles on whatever anybody does. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>the</b> Beatles have been such a huge influence and inspiration on music in general. The Beatles, they're ingrained in everybody's mind.... The Beatles are like our nursery rhymes for all of us; it's the planet's nursery rhymes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final four}} months of the game's {{development}} constituted [...] "crunch time". During this period, Neurath rented an extremely small basement office space in a Somerville, Massachusetts social services building: he sought to circumvent the long commute that several team members had been making from Massachusetts. Furniture consisted of inexpensive folding tables and [...] "uncomfortable red deck chairs". Development {{took place during the}} winter, but the room was drafty and poorly heated. The team hired college friends such as Marc LeBlanc to bug test the game, and Spector stayed at the studio for roughly a month and a half, according to Church. Spector later said that [...] "in that little office, that team created some serious magic. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>the</b> sense of doing something incredible was palpable". Neurath summarized, [...] "Despite the austere working environment, the game came together amazingly well in the final stretch, and we delivered the Gold Master just about two years after we had started." [...] The game was released in March 1992.|$|E
500|$|The vocals for [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] were {{recorded}} at CBS Columbia Square, starting on August 24 and continuing sporadically {{until the very}} last day of assembly on September 21. The episodic structure of the composition was continuously revised as the group experimented with different ideas. Brian remembers that he began recording the [...] "bop bop good vibrations" [...] parts first, and that {{he came up with}} [...] "the high parts" [...] a week later. Mike Love recalled: [...] "I can remember doing 25–30 vocal overdubs of the same part, and when <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> same part, I mean same section of a record, maybe no more than two, three, four, five seconds long." [...] Dennis Wilson was to have sung the lead vocal, but due to a bout of laryngitis, Carl replaced him at the last minute. In early September, the master tapes for [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] were stolen. Mysteriously, they reappeared inside Brian's home two days later.|$|E

500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, my jaw just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{believe that}} Christ is truly {{present in the}} Lord’s Supper; yea, {{we believe that there}} is no communion without the {{presence}} of Christ. This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (<b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught). And this is in brief the substance of what we maintain in this controversy, and what not we, but the truth itself teaches." ...|$|E
