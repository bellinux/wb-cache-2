40|$|The Functions and the Ordering of Conditional `If Clauses' in English [...] -A Genre AnalysisPrevious {{research}} studies {{are in agreement}} that the canonical order for English if conditionals is sentence-initial rather than final. However, earlier findings regarding {{the distribution of the}} ordering between initial and final if-conditionals represent only those patterns specific to the limited number of <b>genres</b> <b>examined.</b> This corpus linguistic study is based on a research approach which includes a larger sampling pool and a selection of representative genres as well as detailed statistical and content analyses. It examines the variations in the distributional patterns between initial and final if-clauses within each individual genre and across different genres. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} if-conditionals have significantly different distributional pattern across genres. In contrast to the consensus view in current literature that initial if-clause rather than final is the dominant clause order, in 3 of the <b>genres</b> <b>examined</b> in this study (Letters to the Editor, Recipes and Sports News) final if-clauses occur more frequently than initial. In addition, in 3 other genres (News Reportage, Science Fiction and Romance Fiction) these two clause types are equally distributed. This study thus identifies genre as a significant factor influencing sentential if-conditional placement. The study also argues that in addition to the expression of topic and focus discourse relations, the ordering of the conditional and consequence clauses is often used to convey specific pragmatic effects and to perform functions related to genre-specific needs, including social politeness and showing power deixis, hedging or strengthening a proposition.

40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, various moral panics {{have emerged in}} {{response}} to concerns about children and teens. In particular, interest in entertainment appealing to youth {{has been the focus}} of social and legislative changes aimed at protecting youth from increased sexual and violent content associated with comic books, music lyrics, Internet content, and film and television. The intent of this study is to compare the emergence and progression of moral panics related to entertainment appealing to youth, such as comic books, music lyrics, the Internet, and film and television, since 1938 to 2010 to better understand the ways we construct youth in the context of moral panics. Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s 1972 model of the progression of moral panics was used to compare reactions to entertainment appealing to youth over a 50 -year period of time to determine if they followed similar patterns. Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s 1972 model was also used to examine the various ways youth is constructed during moral panics. The model clearly exemplifies that reactions to the entertainment <b>genres</b> <b>examined</b> in the study do follow Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s (1972) pattern. Whereas the comic book and music lyrics were easier to track, technology complicated tracking of responses when examining reactions to Internet and film and television. Conclusions are drawn that how youth is constructed in the context of moral panics is closely related to how adulthood and parenthood is constructed. When parenting habits come under scrutiny, it appears that youth are viewed with suspicion as delinquents; on the other hand, when outside issues or events are targeted as problematic, youth are viewed as in need of protection. Thus, the construction of youth in the context of moral panics appears to be as focused on parenthood as it is on childhood or adolescence...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} a study of {{personal}} pronouns in context and aims at revealing trends in popular and research articles written by historians. Focusing on two pronouns that {{turn out to be}} positive and negative keywords when comparing popular and research writing, the analysis has focused first on distinguishing averred from attributed forms and then on patterns of semantic preference and semantic sequence. Corpus and genre have {{played a key role in}} approaches to English for Academic Purposes (EAP) over the past 20 years. The interplay between the two notions, far from leading to contradictory methods, has proved extremely fruitful both from a descriptive and from a pedagogic point of view (Swales 2002). The integration of tools that can be related to the two notions has provided excellent means for the analysis of language variation across genres, cultures and disciplines. 	Swales’s (1990) seminal book on genre analysis initiated a vast area of EAP studies combining descriptive and pedagogic interest in the role of genre-based studies (Bhatia 1993, 2004; Berkenkotter/Huckin 1995; Johns 1997, 2002; Hyland 2000, 2006; Paltridge 2001; Swales 2004). Genre, defined as a class of communicative events with a particular purpose recognized by a discourse community (Swales 1990), rapidly became the focus of analysis and the key organizing principle of pedagogic programmes. Genres are staged, goal-oriented social processes in Hallidayan terms (cf. Halliday/Matthiesen 2004, Martin/Rose 2007). This means that they are described in terms of sequences of moves and steps (representing their generic structure) with elements of variation: there can be optional moves, a flexible order, and patterns of embedding and repetition. The fact that they are seen as social processes accounts for their dynamism (change across different contexts, in response to new media or to changes in the cultural and disciplinary background) and for the major role played by intertextual reference to other texts. 	Corpus approaches to language analysis (e. g. Sinclair 1991, 2004; Stubbs 1996, 2001; Tognini Bonelli 2001; Hunston 2002) have greatly contributed to register studies, as “a corpus is a collection of naturally occurring language text, chosen to characterize a state or a variety of a language” (Sinclair 1991 : 171). Specialized corpora can thus be used to describe the practices of particular discourse communities (Biber et al. 1998; Ghadessy et al. 2001; Gavioli 2005; Connor/Upton 2004; Biber 2006). Wordlists reveal the range and frequency of occurrence of language items; concordances allow the study of specific items in their lexico-grammatical, semantic and pragmatic environment; phraseology contributes to the exploration of systematic relations between text and form (Sinclair 2004). 	Genre studies have rapidly taken advantage of the potential of corpus linguistics (e. g. Hyland 1998; Bondi 1999) and have become firmly rooted in a growing body of literature focusing on the integration of corpus and discourse approaches (Partington et al. 2004; Baker 2006, Ädel/Reppen 2008). This means relating textual practices to language choice, so that statements about genre can be supported with reference to data and, on the other hand, corpus data are not only described but also interpreted in terms of textual structure and social action (Bondi 2008). Attention to frequency and patterns highlights the existence of systematic relations in texts on a functional or semantic basis. The whole process can be seen as a form of interaction between the analyst and different types of data and methodological tools. Moving beyond the corpus-based vs corpus-driven distinction (Tognini-Bonelli 1993), but still keeping the distinction in mind as a heuristic tool, corpus work can be seen as both ‘catalysing’ the analysis (in a corpus-driven direction) and supporting the interpretation of data in terms of discourse (in a corpus-based direction). The two perspectives co-construct the research process. Genre and corpus are powerful resources for the teacher. As tools for syllabus design and materials development, they have led to more explicit repertoires for teaching/assessing purposes, helping teachers identify genres and their rhetorical structure, typical lexis, grammar and phraseology. Genre analysis has greatly contributed to selecting authentic tasks for students, whereas corpus linguistics has helped shift the focus from what is ‘possible’ in the language to what is ‘probable’ in a specific discourse area relevant to students. Together they have supported the development of reference materials (grammars, dictionaries, coursebooks) based on authentic language use and greatly contributed to EAP in particular (Bondi/Diani 2009) Genre and corpus approaches can be used to heighten learners’ awareness of language in use, through such observation skills as validating, formulating and checking hypotheses about the rhetorical structures and language characterizing specific communicative situations (Flowerdew 2005). Genre-specific corpora can be developed by the learners themselves and used independently, thus becoming learner-centred tools for life-long learning (Charles 2007). Methodologically, the integration of these two perspectives has also implied an integrated approach to learning. Genre analysis has emphasised the use of authentic language and task-based learning; corpus work, on the other hand, has contributed to learning by ‘noticing’ or ‘discovery’ (Bernardini 2000, 2002). Activities often move from genre to corpus and back, focusing both on function (and the different ways in which a function is realized) and on form (multiple instances of the same pattern) (Bondi/Radighieri 2010). Of course there are also important caveats with both approaches. The problem with genre analysis is the rigidity of some of its classifications; critical analysts emphasize the need to avoid prescriptivism (Starfield 1996) and to promote flexibility without arbitrariness in genre categories and the naming of genres and communicative functions (Johns 2011). Selecting examples becomes a very exacting task for the teacher (the search for the ‘perfect’ text, according to Swales 2009), while learners should learn to combine communicative learning with (critical) awareness. Corpus analysis, on the other hand, runs the risk of atomization, focusing mainly on the smallest units of discourse. Teachers may find it very difficult to select appropriate corpora and to choose which items to focus on, design tasks and generalize findings (Ajimer 2009), integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches (Charles 2007). This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities of combining the two approaches, as well as ways of integrating them through a study of language variation across research genres and popular genres in the discipline of history. Starting from elements of variation between research articles and popular articles, as outlined in genre studies, this analysis focuses on voice markers that characterize the two sets of data. Corpus data have helped us to test hypotheses as to the nature of the <b>genres</b> <b>examined.</b> What exactly is meant by recontextualization in popular writing? What distinguishes the writer’s voice in research and popular writing? Starting from word forms highlighted by quantitative analysis of the corpora, it was possible to use qualitative concordance analysis to illuminate the process of reader engagement that characterizes popular genres. Raising awareness of the different co-texts can guide learners to understand the important difference between research and popular writing, thus helping them to master the resources of authorial voice in different genres...|$|E

40|$|Aesthetic {{perception}} of {{music has been}} extensively researched in the last decades. Numerous studies suggest that listeners find {{a piece of music}} more or less pleasant according to its complexity. Experimental results show that complexity and liking have different relationship according to the musical <b>genre</b> <b>examined,</b> and that these two variables are also affected by other factors such as familiarity to the music and expertise of the listener. Although previous experiments have <b>examined</b> several <b>genres</b> such as jazz, pop, rock and bluegrass, surprisingly, no study has focused on contemporary music. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying the relationships between complexity, liking, musical training and familiarity in the case of contemporary music. By analysing this genre – which is usually underrepresented in music cognition – it is possible to shed some light on the correlation between liking and complexity in the case of highly complex music. To obtain data, a multifactor experiment was designed in which both music experts and novices had to provide scores of subjective complexity and liking for four 30 -second long excerpts of contemporary music with different degrees of complexity. Empirical results suggest that liking and complexity are negatively correlated in the case of contemporary music and that listeners’ expertise does not influence the perceived complexity of musical pieces, but it can significantly affect liking. This possibly indicates that experts have the musical knowledge needed to appreciate extremely complex music, while novices do not...|$|R
