Measurement of uptake by the blinded reader in the 54 foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax for FCH versus FDG [6.10, range (2.3 - 16); vs 4.65, range (1 – 20.6); P[*]=[*] 0.0007).|$|R

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods.
