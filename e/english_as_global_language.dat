30|$|Second, the {{emergence}} of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> <b>global</b> <b>language</b> has brought about significant changes to the education policy and practice in education systems around the world. Many countries in Asia have adopted English as an official language or have recognised it as the priority foreign language {{to compete in the}} global market (Nunan, [2003]). In line with this, the latest National Education Policy 2010 identified English education as the tool to create a knowledge-based society. However, lack of English communication skills continue to challenge Bangladesh's industrial workforce to compete in the global market. Roshid and Webb ([2013]) have pointed out that the gap between theoretical knowledge and the practical experiences of the workplace have kept away industrial workers from participating more fully in the fiercely competitive global job market. They argue that university graduates in Bangladesh are still not well trained in English {{to the extent that they}} could enhance graduate opportunities and invest in their performance in the industry. Therefore, given the importance of the English in both global and regional contexts, policy makers need to rethink how the English curriculum can be redesigned to address such existing gaps in tertiary education.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems underlying the <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> vs. local languages debate is that they often adhere to the dichotomous ‘global vs. local’ vision of transnational communication, treating them as incommensurable discourses and often reviving the spectre of cultural authenticity. Yet <b>global</b> movies, such <b>as</b> Baz Luhrmann’s Australia, use the potential of transmedia and transcultural strategies to reach a global audience. T he production of such movies exploits the growing realization within the media industries that what is variously called «transmedia, multiplatform, or enhanced storytelling» represents the future of entertainment and its economic growth (Jenkins 2003; 2006). On the other side, in order to enter {{the daily lives of}} its global audience, the film production decided to exploit the power of another social good: Australian culture. T hus, as the critical applied linguistics scholar, Alistair Pennycook, notes, the literature on <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> has often failed to investigate whether <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> may be defined as a «translocal» language, a language of fluidity that moves across, while becoming embedded in, the materiality of localities and social relations. T he analysis of interlingual translations of post-colonial English language varieties, but also of their intralingual translation into global English, will provide some significant «insights» on how the materiality of globalization shapes translocal social knowledge, creates translocal audiences and contributes {{to the creation of a}} supervernacular language.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{distinguish}} between the following two hypotheses: (A) The Internet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause more people to learn <b>English</b> <b>as</b> second language and thus solidify the role of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> This outcome will prevail even though there are more native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English speakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the native languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power) and will not promote <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> <b>English's</b> "early lead" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are not native English speakers frequently access the large number of English language web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing web sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their sites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical question, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not English use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English speakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data set on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada provides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the two official languages. Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to Internet use for French-speaking Quebecois.

The analyses rest on both qualitative approaches (VOICE and You Tube clips) and quantitative approaches (one type of DPTs, two types of MJTs and one type of semantic differential). The studies show that quantitative analyses with experimental methods often falsify hypotheses that have suggested themselves from prior qualitative research ("let-it pass principle " among natives and non-natives) and from normative language guides ("learner-book illusion", "complex-is-polite principle", "middle slots relevance"). The article then shows how the linguistic findings from such experimental designs {{can and should be}} rendered into principles and components for Teaching <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>Global</b> <b>Language,</b> which would require constant work-in-progress models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reconsider the concept of the native speaker of English in light of the {{heightened}} status of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> The broadening and acceptance of criteria regarding who is a native speaker is historically discussed and placed in a modern context. In particular, perceptions towards the English native speaker and the relationship between language and culture were explored through a semi-structured oral interview administered to 56 respondents. Questions in the interview explored perceptions towards non-native speaker’s use of English, cultural influence on language, and intercultural communication, among other topics. Interview results show that the respondents are aware that the spread of English across the world has reshaped the notion of the native speaker and the ownership of English. Respondents also recognize the inseparable relationship between language and culture. It is suggested that instead of the term “native speaker of English ” the term “glocalized or global English speaker ” better reflects the somewhat ambiguous nature of English speakers.

Second, it explores this relationship by tracing English in the contemporary neoliberal context to the history of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> an element of overseas colonial rule. It employs Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano’s notion of coloniality of power (2000) to illustrate that the colonial context of neoliberal global English serves not merely as a historical legacy but as an enduring structure of oppressive power that continues to establish hierarchical difference through linguistic othering. This article highlights the historical context of colonial English instruction to demonstrate how <b>English</b> imposition served <b>as</b> the foundation for the neoliberal privileging of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> Specifically, it presents the cases of American colonial English instruction in Puerto Rico and the Philippines as a developmental link to the current neoliberal status of global English. It illuminates how American colonial administrations established English instruction in a manner that mystified its imposed nature and the context of conquest. This article thus depicts both how English is bound with neoliberalism and how claims of global English’s neutrality belie the historic colonial inequalities, which created the conditions for its existence.

In our tertiary institutions, it is common to hear the students exhibit their proficiency in the language in relation to multidimensional space of level of education, ethnic background, discipline and style. In the teaching of English in our tertiary institutions, the argument is that the teachers of English have to be conscious of the sociolinguistic variables that may affect students’ performance before embarking on effective teaching.
