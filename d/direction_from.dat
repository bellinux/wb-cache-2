5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid {{movement}} is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> Oslo to Hønefoss; {{followed}} by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E

Another stone, known as the Hajar as-Sa’adah (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's opposite corner, al-Rukn al-Yamani (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone. The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (al-qabul) and the <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> which Canopus rises.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One <b>Direction,</b> <b>from</b> soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked just one of the original applicants. Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as The Wanted and the Spice Girls were created similarly.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the Mk. I to III, various units had been flying the systems in an effort to develop suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the Chain Home (CH) sites talk to the fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> the CH stations towards real targets.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his <b>direction,</b> <b>from</b> virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E

With no takers, he renewed the offer in 1924, when aviation technology had advanced enough {{at that point that}} many people tried for the prize.

5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk Regional Planning Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with new service roads. A similar project was {{planned for the}} nearby four-lane NY347 through Islip. To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each <b>direction</b> <b>from</b> Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after {{it became clear that the}} Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into full-blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E
