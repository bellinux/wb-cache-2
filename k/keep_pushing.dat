5|$|The militant suffragettes, {{who were}} at one point public enemies, were now seen as fierce {{nationalist}} and patriots. Old foes became allies and vice versa. Lloyd George was now referred to as 'that great Welshman' while Labours' Kier Hardie, the WSPU's staunchest defender before the war, was lambasted for his pacifist stance. There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing</b> the agenda of emancipation. Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU (SWSPU), amongst their members were Conway-born Helena Jones, who continued to campaign for women's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet.|$|E

500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, Sleater-Kinney {{wanted to work}} with {{producer}} Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo's critically acclaimed 1997album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson, who had recorded every previous Sleater-Kinney album. As Tucker explained, [...] "These songs warranted a different production, so we looked to other people". The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways, stating that it was important for them not to make the same record twice. According to Tucker, [...] "We have to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing</b> in order to stay interested in making music together, we want to have longevity as a band". Similarly, drummer Janet Weiss stated that they [...] "wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out, to make each song have a real strong personality". The album was written {{over the course of a}} year, which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album. It was recorded at Avast! Recording Company in Seattle, Washington in July 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi said that the race had not been easy because his battery had greatly overheated and another lap would have meant {{he would not have}} been able to finish. Nevertheless, he was happy that he had begun the new season with a victory after having ended the previous campaign badly. He later confessed that luck played a role in him securing the win as his car was not set-up to his preferences but reserved praise to his strategist. Second-place finisher di Grassi spoke of his delight with the result and that his race had been [...] "crazy" [...] which demonstrated that this team they did not stop and it was [...] "a great start" [...] to his season. He praised his mechanics for helping him remain on the same lap as the leaders and believed that he was targeting the fastest lap award but his team instructed him to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing.</b> Heidfeld, who finished in third, stated that he was happy to achieve a podium position in the first race of the season and hoped that his team could finish their forward progress in the championship.|$|E

He claimed that the incident with López may have happened to any other driver but was looking forward to the next race of the season where he hoped to qualify in a good position and his team were going to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing.</b> Bird was disappointed with the result, saying it was beneficial if the technical problems with his second at the pit stop were diagnosed in the season's first race rather than later on. His teammate López thanked the sport's fans for voting him to receive the Fan Boost and was upbeat despite retiring from his maiden ePrix: [...] "The car is fast and I think qualifying proved that. I’m sure the end result will be much, much better in Marrakech." [...] Vergne told the press that he lost the chance to achieve a strong result in the race when his car developed problems with his car's water pump and described the event as [...] "a big mess" [...] but felt certain that he could secure the championship.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, while Television Without Pity {{gave it a}} C+. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth best episode of the series, {{explaining}} [...] "The late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts, the musical film noir homage 'Brown Betty'... was an offbeat gem that expressed all of Fringes core themes — redemption, connection, rehumanization — and encapsulated the key relationships (the slow-moving Walter-Peter reconciliation; Peter and Olivia's carefully tended soul-deep romance) more poignantly than most on-point episodes of Fringe, and it left fans wanting the show to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing</b> the innovation. It could never do it enough." [...] In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "it shouldn’t work, and yet it does, because although technically nothing happens, the episode shows us just how deep Walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt, making himself the villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven. It also gives the audience a refreshing break {{from some of the}} high level angst {{of the end of the}} season, allowing Peter and Olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in the ‘real’ world have been torn apart. Also, there are singing corpses in it. Only on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! {{noted that}} {{songs in the}} vein of [...] "Partition" [...] {{effectively}} display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Matthew Perpetua of BuzzFeed praised the French spoken section on [...] "Partition", comparing it to the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sample on [...] "Flawless" [...] as she added: [...] "It's good that these ideas aren't directly expressed by Beyoncé herself– in context, these bits are like reblogged quotes that frame her artistic intentions– because she knows she doesn’t need to be so didactic when she's actually singing about sex, {{and to do so}} would defeat her point about owning her pleasures." [...] Caitlin White of The 405 wrote extensively of [...] "Partition" [...] as a song that effectively shows that Beyoncé [...] "catapults herself out of her very femininity into personhood by positioning female sexuality as a powerful, amorphous construct--one that transcends the female body even while uplifting it." [...] White concluded that the singer does not exalt herself to become [...] "the highest sex object or an egotistical pop princess" [...] but anoints herself [...] "as sexual goddess, she is at once desiring and desired, fulfilled and fulfilling". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the spooky, almost perversely stripped-down 'Partition' reflect [...] determination, rare among superstars, to <b>keep</b> <b>pushing</b> creatively".|$|E

500|$|Among {{conservative}} and neoconservative {{critics in the}} United States, The Power of Nightmares {{has been described as}} [...] "conspiracy theory", anti-American or both. David Asman of FoxNews.com said, [...] "We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they <b>keep</b> <b>pushing</b> the barrier, now to the point of absurdity." [...] His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, ending his commentary on the film for National Review by saying, [...] "British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of 'Amerika' as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth." [...] Other commentators have variously described the film as pushing a conspiracy theory. Davis and British commentator David Aaronovitch both explicitly labelled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis [...] "his argument is as subtle as a house-brick." [...] Attacks in this vein continued after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, with the Christian Broadcasting Network referencing the film as a source for claims by the [...] "British left" [...] that [...] "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud", and the Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council calling it [...] "the loopiest, most extreme anti-war documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC." [...] In The Shadows in the Cave, Curtis emphasises that he does not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had been greatly exaggerated. He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory by saying he believes the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film [...] "have stumbled on it." ...|$|E

Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games like Excitebike and Kung Fu, {{by a desire to}} give the ROM cartridge format [...] "a final exclamation point" [...] in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of [...] "athletic games" [...] with a character running and jumping with many obstacles.

Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed.
