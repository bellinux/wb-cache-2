As fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity are not included in these models, environmental life-cycle assessment of products (LCA) may produce incorrect results for these impact categories. This paper outlines the spatially explicit regional air pollution information and simulation model (RAINS-LCA), which was developed for the calculation of acidification and terrestrial <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) air emissions and acidification potentials for sulfur dioxide (SO 2) air emissions for Europe and a number of European regions, taking fate, background depositions and effects into account. Two impact definitions are explored in the calculations: 1) the marginal change in the hazard index of all ecosystems in Europe and 2) the marginal change in the hazard index of ecosystems in Europe where the critical load is actually exceeded. The inclusion of fate, background depositions, and ecosystem sensitivity results in a different ranking of substances compared to simpler model outcomes. In the context of acidification, emissions of nitrogen compounds are regarded as about a factor 2 less important relative to sulfur compounds. Furthermore, using RAINS-LCA as opposed to simpler models, it was found that region-specific differences in terrestrial <b>eutrophication</b> and acidification <b>potentials</b> range up to 1. 5 and 3. 5 orders of magnitude, respectively. By means of scenario analysis, it was also shown that "only above critical load" terrestrial <b>eutrophication</b> and acidification <b>potentials</b> for the years 1995 and 2010 differ up to 0. 6 order and 1 order of magnitude, respectively. These results imply {{that it is important to}} use region-specific and time-specific acidification and terrestrial <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials,</b> if it is expected that life-cycle emissions of acidifying and eutrophying air pollutants are predominantly situated in a few (European) regions and within a specific year.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the water quality}} and sediment quality near Zhuyuan and Bailonggang sewage outfalls and compared them {{with those of the}} large waters of Changjiang estuary. The trophic states in the estuarine waters are evaluated by employing different standards. Serious nitrogen and phosphorus pollutions are found in the waters near the outfalls, which are due to large sewage discharges of Shanghai City. Heavy metals and other pollutants are found at low concentrations and cause no serious water and sediment pollution. In the Changjiang estuary, the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, lead and COD are relatively high and are rising year by year. It is concluded that the sewage discharges from Shanghai provides large quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus but little heavy metals to the estuary.

The main differences between the environmental balances of the two systems were relative to water use, <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and energy use. Independently of the system used, feed is the key indicator in determining the environmental balance (notwithstanding <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and water dependence) monitored by fish production, chemical products, buildings and energy consumption. Consequently, when considering the RSF with a lower feed conversion ratio (0. 8 versus 1. 1 for FTF), the environmental balance of the RSF is more favourable at both global and regional levels, except with regards to energy use. RSF water dependence is 93 % lower than the FTF and its <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> is 26 - 38 % lower due to reduced waste release. On the other hand, at 57, 659 MJ per ton of fish produced (16 kWh per kg), the RSF consumes 24 - 40 % more energy than the FTF, especially for aeration and water treatment. Nevertheless, the RSF has significant potential for energy reduction through improvements to airlift and biofilter designs which would reduce RSF energy use to a level {{similar to that of}} the FTF (34, 869 - 43, 841 MJ per ton of fish produced, corresponding to 10 and 12 kWh respectively).

40|$|AbstractFinancial {{incentives}} in many European {{countries have}} led to a surge in anaerobic digestion (AD) installations to produce heat and/or electricity from biogas. This paper presents the life cycle environmental impacts of a system producing biogas from agricultural wastes by AD and co-generating heat and electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The results suggest that this can lead to significant reductions in most impacts compared to fossil-fuel alternatives, including the global warming potential (GWP) which can be reduced by up to 50 %. However, the acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> are respectively 25 and 12 times higher than for natural gas CHP. The impacts are influenced by the type and source of feedstock, digestate storage and its application on land. Using energy crops such as maize instead of waste reduces the GWP owing to higher biogas yields, but eight out of 11 impacts increase compared to using waste feedstocks. If digestate is not used to displace artificial fertilisers, the majority of impacts are higher than from natural gas CHP. Some other bioenergy options have lower GWP than energy from biogas, including woodchip CHP plants. Implications for policy are discussed {{based on the results of}} the study...|$|R

In this work we investigate a complex system, the Domingo Rubio tideland (Huelva, Spain), where a tidal marsh and a continental lagoon converge. This wetland, catalogued as Natural Park by the Andalusia government, {{is subjected to}} a high eutrophicant pressures related to the strawberry culture and the inputs coming from industrial wastes. NO 2 −, NO 3 − and PO 43 − were analyzed in 41 water samples, obtaining values up to 100 mg L− 1 Σ(NO 2 −, NO 3 −) and 18. 5 mg L− 1 PO 43 −. All these values exceed the accepted levels by the European Environment Agency. N/P ratios and the Aquatic <b>Eutrophication</b> <b>Potentials</b> (AEP) for N and P showed a constant imbalance of the system. During one tidal cycle, the tidal channel can have both N and P as limiting nutrient (P is the limiting nutrient during low tide and N is during high tide) and there exists an alternation of AEP domination too between N and P in the continental area, what points to an excess of both nutrients all over the study area, and to the necessity of diminishing the nutrient inputs and a higher control on these pollution sources as well...|$|R

The analytical framework included the definition of functional unit, system boundaries, complimentary system design, waste management, and partial use of the energy. Three different municipal solid waste management scenarios, incineration, composting, and digestion were considered for the study. All wastes from Östersund municipality were classified into biodegradable and combustible and thereafter treated for energy and compost production. Greenhouse gas emissions and total environmental impacts were quantified and evaluated their corresponding benefits compared to three different types of marginal energy production system. The {{results showed that the}} major greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions are greater in composting scenario, whereas methane emission is greater in digestion scenario. Composting scenario that uses additional coal fuel has greater global warming potential and acidification potential compared to other scenarios. Composting scenario using wood fuel additional energy has greater <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential.</b> The highest reduction in global warming potential is achieved when digestion scenario replace coal energy. The greater reduction in acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> achieved when digestion scenario replaced coal energy, and wood fuel respectively.

Two treatments (aerated and non-aerated) were performed to grow microalgae under semi-controlled conditions in semi-closed photobioreactors in a greenhouse. The results showed no significant pH and coliforms (total and Escherichia coli) variation between treatments.

Also, in order to apply environmental indicators for agricultural decision making purposes, the environmental burden of different residue management practices were compared. Primary data were collected from 150 rapeseed farms from the Iranian Mazandaran province. The system considers a cradle-to-farm gate boundary, and the functional unit was regarded as being one Mg of rapeseed production. The LCA results indicate that the global warming potential amounts to 1181. 6 kg CO 2 eq Mg− 1. Also, the acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> were found to be 23. 3 kg SO 2 eq Mg− 1 and 18 kg PO 4 3 eq Mg− 1, respectively. The results also reveal that environmental emissions of crop production were significantly affected by residue management practices. Specifically, rapeseed residue removal from the field is the most environmentally-friendly practice. This is followed by a scenario involving residue incorporation in the soil. The practice of burning such residue entails the highest environmental emissions. In conclusion, reducing the consumption of chemical fertilisers, especially nitrogen based ones, is important for decreasing the environmental footprints in the area. Furthermore, avoiding crop residue burning and developing rapeseedbean rotation are favourable management strategies for establishing more environmentally-friendly rapeseed production systems in the region...|$|R

However, ignoring variability and induced uncertainty of LCA results reduces their significance, especially when dealing with agricultural processes that present high natural fluctuations. The objective {{of the study was}} to explore the robustness of LCA results when accounting for variable emissions data, illustrated by the case of slurry application techniques. Four application techniques were compared: band spreading, broadcast spreading, harrowing after surface application and direct injection. On the basis of the normalisation results, acidification, eutrophication and global warming potentials were selected. To estimate field nitrogen emissions, an original approach was developed based on relative nitrogen loss factors for each technique from a literature review. The calculated field emissions from different soil and climate conditions were considered equally probable and were propagated into a range of LCA result using the Monte Carlo method. Injection and harrowing both showed reduced acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> compared to band spreading and broadcast spreading but had larger global warming potentials, which could be particularly important with injection. Harrowing consequently appeared as the best compromise. Despite the large range of LCA results, robust conclusions could be drawn.

This thesis assessed {{the environmental impact of}} systems recycling plant nutrients from slaughterhouse waste, toilet waste fractions, digested food waste and mussels too small to be used in food production. The methodology used was life cycle assessment (LCA) and the functional unit was production of 1 kg plant-available nitrogen. The environmental impact categories studied were primary energy use, global warming <b>potential</b> (GWP), <b>potential</b> <b>eutrophication</b> and <b>potential</b> acidification. Flow of cadmium to arable soil, use of non-renewable phosphate rock and potential carbon sequestration were also assessed. In addition, additional functions such as phosphorus added to arable soil, energy production, removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater streams etc. were considered. The reference scenario for all comparisons was the production and use of chemical fertilisers. In general, storage and spreading of the organic fertilisers contributed greatly to <b>potential</b> <b>eutrophication</b> and acidification, except in the case of meat meal fertiliser, which was in a pseudo-stable form. All investigated fertilisers gave rise to goal conflicts as none of the fertilisers reduced the impact for all impact categories studied.

Meat meal reduced, or had similar results as the reference scenario, for all impact categories except primary energy use and <b>potential</b> <b>eutrophication.</b> For digested food waste, chemical fertiliser use was an environmentally better option for all impacts. Composting gave rise to large nitrogen emissions, thus anaerobic storage was a better environmental option for mussel treatment.

However, regarding the acidification, particulate matter, and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials,</b> most biomass systems are inferior to the reference systems. Switching to a zero-emission electricity mix offers benefits for all the biomass and fossil-H 2 systems and researchers should use databases cautiously. The bio-H 2 and FT diesel of wood-based systems show the best environmental performance and satisfy the current and future RED targets. On one hand, the bio-H 2 systems result in the largest benefits regarding the global warming potential, and on the other hand, both wood-based FT diesel systems offer overall benefits which concern not only the sustainable target of CO 2 emissions reduction, but also the air quality improvement of the broader area as well.|$|R
40|$|Air {{emissions}} from shipping have received attention {{in recent years}} and the shipping industry is striving for solutions to reduce their emissions and to comply with stricter regulations. Strategies to reduce emissions can consist of a fuel switch, engine changes, or end-ofpipe technologies, but they do not necessarily imply reduced life cycle emissions. The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction. LNG and other alternatives that comply with the SECA 2015 and Tier III NOx requirements give decreased acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> with 78 – 90 per cent in a life cycle perspective compared with HFO. In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8 – 20 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective. The study supports the need for LCA when evaluating the environmental impact of a fuel change, e. g. it is found that the highest global warming potential during the whole life cycle is connected to the alternatives with GTL fuel...|$|R

Recovery of cardboard, either as material or energy, is believed to reduce the impacts on the environment from the global warming point of view. European Union has been promoting recycling which resulted in recycling {{of the majority of}} well-separated cardboard. Published life cycle assessment studies show that recycling can provide the best benefits to the environment. However, some other studies argue that incineration with energy recovery would bring more credits. The technological data and system boundaries of the studies were proved to affect the outcome of the recovery methods studied. The present thesis was carried out assuming high technology data for both recycling and incineration with energy recovery. The main focus was on global warming potential (GWP), but also acidification (AP) and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> (EP) were taken into consideration. Results of all three impact categories supported the option of energy recovery had higher benefits compared to material recovery. Even though recycling could reduce the environmental burdens in GWP, this method resulted in additional impacts on AP and EP. Full replacement of virgin fibers could offer better results than partial substitution for GWP but it was opposite for AP and EP. Sensitivity analysis supported the superiority of energy recovery as the recovery method always reduced GWP, AP and EP. Performance of the recycling was not as steady as energy recovery. When electricity from natural gas or grid mix was substituted, energy recovery provides lower savings than in the baseline scenario...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the environmental impacts for the provision of cooking heat from biogas with the {{utilization of}} dung cakes. For this purpose, the method of life cycle assessment was used for assessing the impact categories global warming potential, acidification potential, <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> and human toxicity potential. The results show that anaerobic digestion at household scale can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG?s) as well as several other emissions in rural areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of bioenergy supply systems can be determined using life cycle assessment methodologies. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} production of Miscanthus pellets and briquettes, potentially used to satisfy renewable energy requirements in Ireland. The impact categories considered are particularly important when assessing bioenergy systems; global warming potential, acidification potential, <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential,</b> and energy demand. The scope of the study incorporates Miscanthus cultivation, harvest, processing and transport to a biomass distributor. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effects of changes in keys variables on the overall {{environmental impact}}s of the system. The scenarios examined include replacement of synthetic fertilisers with biosolids, Miscanthus processing by pelleting and briquetting, and transport distances of 50 and 100 km. Results indicate that maintenance and processing of the Miscanthus crop have the most environmental impacts with transport having less of an effect. Replacing synthetic fertiliser with biosolids results in a reduction in global warming potential of 23 – 33 % and energy demand of 12 – 18 %, but raises both acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> by 290 – 400 % and 258 – 300 %, respectively. Pelleting of Miscanthus requires more energy than briquetting, hence has higher impacts in each category assessed. Increasing the transport distance from 50 to 100 km, results in a small increase in each impact category. Miscanthus briquette production compares favourably with wood pellet, kerosene, and coal production, with Miscanthus pelleting proving more environmentally damaging...|$|E
40|$|Managing the water-energy-nutrient nexus for {{the built}} {{environment}} requires, in part, a full system analysis of energy consumption, global warming and eutrophication potentials of municipal water services. As an example, we evaluated the life cycle energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and aqueous nutrient releases of the whole anthropogenic municipal water cycle starting from raw water extraction to wastewater treatment and reuse/discharge for five municipal water and wastewater systems. The assessed options included conventional centralized services and four alternative options following the principles of source-separation and water fit-for-purpose. The comparative life cycle assessment identified that centralized drinking water supply coupled with blackwater energy recovery and on-site greywater treatment and reuse was the most energy- and carbon-efficient water service system evaluated, while the conventional (drinking water and sewerage) centralized system ranked as the most energy- and carbon-intensive system. The electricity generated from blackwater and food residuals co-digestion was estimated to offset at least 40 % of life cycle energy consumption for water/waste services. The dry composting toilet option demonstrated the lowest life cycle <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential.</b> The nutrients in wastewater effluent are the dominating contributors for the <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potential</b> for the assessed system configurations. Among the parameters for which variability and sensitivity were evaluated, the carbon intensity of the local electricity grid and the efficiency of electricity production by the co-digestion with the energy recovery process {{were the most important}} for determining the relative global warming potential results...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{activities}} are receiving special attention {{in recent years}} concerning the quantification of their environmental profiles {{in order to be}} competitive. This study aims to evaluate the environmental profile of the production of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) biomass in France under two different management scenarios (an intensive scenario: IMS and an extensive one: EMS), representative of the real practices in the country. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to evaluate the environmental loads from a cradle-to-gate perspective. According to the results, the choice of the best management scenario will depend on the impact category considered. Thus, IMS has lower fuel requirements and it is the best option in categories directly related to fuel consumption by forest machineries, such as abiotic resources depletion, cumulative energy demand, global warming potential and photochemical oxidants formation. On the contrary, EMS will be preferred in terms of acidification and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials</b> with reductions of up to 26 %. The reason behind these reductions is {{based on the fact that}} these categories are considerably affected by the fertilizing process, which is not conducted under extensive conditions. Regardless the scenario, the logging stage and specially, the final cutting process, can be considered as the main environmental key factors, playing a major role in all categories. Both the production of the triple superphosphate and pruning processes play leading roles in the IMS and EMS, respectively. The comparison of these environmental profiles with those corresponding to maritime pine in Portugal highlights that the differences observed between both scenarios are related to the intensity of the forest practices as well as the biomass yield.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique sustainability analysis {{of one of}} the first attempts to establish a biodiesel industry in Mexico. From 2008, several companies established medium to large-sized Jatropha curcas plantations in Yucatan, hiring local peasants to carry out the agricultural work. After five years, the plantations were abandoned due to poor seed yields and a lack of key knowledge for large-scale cultivation. Based on a multidisciplinary approach, we performed a three-dimensional sustainability evaluation of the potential biodiesel production chain, which included household interviews, a socioeconomic survey, and a life-cycle assessment (LCA). We identified both negative and positive effects in the three dimensions analyzed. Socially and culturally, the local peasant families understood sustainability as their ability to preserve their traditional lifestyle, and associated environmental services with their sense of identity. They therefore considered the jatropha plantations to be positive for sustainability, since they brought income, even though some perceived damage to the natural resources of the surrounding areas. Economically, peasants’ annual household income increased by approximately $ 1080 USD due to the increased salaries paid by the jatropha companies. The LCA predicted large savings of greenhouse gas emissions (> 50 % compared to fossil diesel), but also potential negative impacts in some categories (human/ecological toxicity and <b>eutrophication</b> <b>potentials)</b> {{associated with the use of}} mineral fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides applied during the cultivation stage. Biodiesel production would be potentially energetically self-sufficient, in addition to producing a 40 % energy surplus. Finally, even though the sustainability indicators suggested a positive overall assessment, the reality was that the jatropha projects failed because they were predicated on unrealistically optimistic projections and poor agronomic knowledge of the plant...|$|R
