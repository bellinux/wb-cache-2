40|$|Hydrostatic {{extrusion}} of annealed 1100 aluminum {{was investigated}} experimentally at ambient temperature. The principal variables studied were lubricant viscosity which was varied {{from less than}} 100 to over 76, 000 SUS at 100 deg F and the diametral clear-ance between the <b>follower</b> <b>block</b> and the Extrusion cylinder which ranged from 0. 0005 to 0. 0030 in. for the 1. 026 in. dia. cylinder. The specimen diameter was 0. 97 or 1. 00 in. cor-responding to an extrusion ratio of 4. 75 or 5. 00, respectively. The included die angle was either 60 deg or 90 deg. The results show that with a proper combination of the lubricant Viscosity and the fol-lower block clearance, hydrostatic extrusion can be accomplished without the necessity of any sealing of the container on the <b>follower</b> <b>block</b> side. The optimum clearance for minimum breakthrough pressure increases as the lubricant viscosity increases. The ex-trusion force increases with die angle. The paper discusses the various factors that affect {{the magnitude of the}} breakthrough pressure and the occasional uneven bamboo-type ap-pearance of the surface. Processing conditions must be selected carefully since the lowest extrusion force does not necessarily lead to a product with the best surface finish...|$|E

The ultimate object of this development project is to compare the extrusion process from a cost standpoint with, the presently used rolling-drilling process. Various experiments have been performed to determine the optimum billet I. D., the proper <b>follower</b> <b>block</b> technique, the proper tooling parameters for the process, and the proper metallurgical structure of the material for optimum results. This extrusion combines many of the past results as a further determination and refinement of the extrusion process {{to be used in the}} final semi-production optimization extrusion.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{experiment}} was to extrude normal uranium hollow billets to I and E `O` size tubing with reduced extruded O. D. {{and also to}} evaluate the use of pressed salt <b>follower</b> <b>blocks.</b> Pressed salt (NaCl) <b>follower</b> <b>blocks</b> under various conditions of pre-heat temperature were compared with the standard graphite at 800 F. Even though some yield reduction results, it was concluded that pressed salt <b>follower</b> <b>blocks</b> at 300 F represent a substantial cost reduction due to the extreme price differential of the two perishable items. Extruded O. D. `s of. 020 inch and. 040 inch less than the standard (nominal) 1. 50 inch represent no gain in yield due to the sharp increase in machined slug rejects for O. D. defects...|$|R

He {{was given}} 'exemption from appearance' {{by the court}} to maintain the law and order situation which could get disturbed due {{to the possibility of}} his followers flocking the court. In 2014, the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued non-bailable arrest warrants against him. In protest, his <b>followers</b> <b>blocked</b> rail and road traffic in Ambala, Panchkula and Chandigarh on November 5. When the police tried to detain him on November 9, his armed followers, including gunmen, formed human chains outside the Satlok Ashram to prevent the police from arresting him. The police tried to initiate a dialogue, and asked him to surrender. Rampal's followers announced that the police will have to kill more than 100,000 followers before arresting him.|$|R

5000|$|As the {{replacement}} for the M1934/5 in Beretta's compact/medium pistol line, the Model 70 integrated the M1951's takedown lever, guide rod system, slide stop, and magazine release button in {{the lower part of}} the grip. The M1934/5 would hold open on empty due to the magazine <b>follower</b> <b>blocking</b> the slide, but removing the magazine would cause the slide to be released unless its safety was subsequently engaged (which would lock the gun open until switched back to Fire mode); this process was slow and cumbersome, which is why the slide stop improvement was implemented in the M1951 and later models of service pistols. [...] The slide stop changed partway through the production run of the pistol from the same [...] "pedal" [...] style release as the M1951 to a round button at the end of the lever. A softer, longer curve that tapered up to the front of the gun was also added to make the trigger guard more sleek. Near the end of its production, the same thumb shelf of the 76W's left grip panel was added to the 70S.|$|R

50|$|A {{standardized}} liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH2) propulsive stage, like Ares V or its <b>follower</b> SLS <b>Block</b> II, {{would send}} the Descent/Ascent Vehicle (DAV), Mars Surface Habitat and Cargo elements to Mars orbit unmanned. The DAV would aerocapture into Mars orbit, preparing it for rendezvous with the manned Transit Habitat to arrive later. The Surface Habitat and Cargo would likely do direct entry. One advantage of the combined Descent/Ascent Vehicle as the spacecraft used for the manned landing, is that it could perform an abort to orbit. A number of technologies for the descent stages were looked at, especially supersonic retro-propulsion for Mars atmospheric entry, but were otherwise very traditional with a large heat shield and retro rockets for final landing.|$|R
