5|$|The Southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty brought the empire <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> civilizations of Southeast Asia. Chinese cultural and technological influence spread to nearby Southeast Asian kingdoms. Remnants of Chinese pottery from the Han dynasty have been excavated in Sumatra, Borneo, and Java that date from the 1st century. Archaeologists have also discovered bronze axes in Cambodia that {{were based on the}} design of Chinese axes.|$|E
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E

5|$|After {{attending}} a public celebration of HSS leader Vladko Maček's birthday on 20 June 1935, Blažeković was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve {{days in a}} prison {{on the island of}} Korčula. He was subsequently taken to Dubrovnik and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state, but was not convicted. In 1939, he joined the Ustaše, a Croatian fascist organization which advocated armed struggle in achieving Croatia's independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, he came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fascist leader Slavko Kvaternik. From late 1940 to early 1941, Blažeković was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Ustaše and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land surface {{and created a}} massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both {{the flow of water}} and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|In 1570, El Greco {{moved to}} Rome, where he {{executed}} {{a series of}} works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c. 1575–76) {{before he left for}} Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).|$|E

5|$|Memories of {{the sack}} of Rome by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, {{had been made}} into a legendary account that was taught to each {{generation}} of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance. In 121 BC, Rome came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Celtic tribes of the Allobroges and the Arverni, both of which they defeated with apparent ease in the First Battle of Avignon near the Rhone river and the Second Battle of Avignon, the same year.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much detail}} {{is known about}} Bhimsen Thapa's early life. At the age of 11, Bhimsen {{possibly}} came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nepalese Royal Palace when his bratabandha ceremony was held together with the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur's in Gorkha in 1785. In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali Durbar, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a kaji (equivalent to a minister).|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E

5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes {{in the matter of}} fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quadrate (which is immovable), {{as well as the}} hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts {{are being made}} to {{limit the amount of}} phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E
5|$|When {{the main}} attacking Japanese force has been located, the player must send all {{available}} air units to engage them in combat. Air combat takes place over real time, and may {{take up to}} a minute of travel time once launched from an aircraft carrier. Aircraft will run out of fuel over time and will crash if not refuelled at a carrier. The game contains elements of arcade gameplay, which will automatically enable once the player comes <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enemy. The arcade sequences involves the player utilising an anti-air machine gun in order to shoot down Japanese aircraft. The game ends once all four Japanese aircraft carriers have been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, the fourth child of Italian {{businessman}} Domingo Belgrano y Peri and Josefa Casero. He came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ideas of the Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain {{around the time of}} the French Revolution. Upon his return to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires, he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals, but found severe resistance from local peninsulars. This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime. At first, he unsuccessfully promoted the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period the Spanish King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned during the Peninsular War (1807–1814). He favoured the May Revolution, which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810. He was elected as a voting member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster.|$|E
5|$|Beresford was {{alerted to}} the French advance by reports {{received}} on 12 May from Spanish patriots in Seville, who had sent word of Soult's departure. Beresford {{kept up the}} pretence of besieging Badajoz by sending an unsuccessful demand for surrender to the French commander {{on the afternoon of}} that same day, but he realized he would now not have time to finish the job, so he ordered the withdrawal of his siege guns and supplies. On 13 May, the Spanish cavalry attached to Colborne's brigade came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French force and, in accordance with orders given by Wellington in April, they fell back while sending word of Soult's new position to Beresford. Later that day Long's British cavalry also encountered the advancing French and hastily pulled back—although Long, too, was following Wellington's orders not to engage, Beresford considered his withdrawal somewhat premature and thought Long could have delayed the French by forcing them to deploy.|$|E
5|$|Both Polish and Russian {{planners}} expected {{an attack}} on Warsaw—and Radzymin in particular—from the east. Yet the first fights started to the north-east of the Polish capital. Warsaw was to be assaulted from the east by the 16th Red Army. At {{the same time the}} 14th Red Army (under Ieronim Uborevich) captured Wyszków and started a fast march westwards, towards Toruń. It was then to cross the lower Vistula and assault Warsaw from the north-west. However, its 21st Rifle Division remained {{on the south side of}} the Bug River and headed for Warsaw directly, under orders from Russia's Commissar of War Leon Trotsky. Aided by the Russian 27th Rifle Division, it came <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Polish forces at Radzymin on August 12, and prepared for an assault the following morning.|$|E
