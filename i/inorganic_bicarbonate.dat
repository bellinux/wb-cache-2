40|$|Strain Hxd 3, an alkane-degrading sulfate reducer {{previously}} {{isolated and}} described by Aeckersberg et al. (F. Aeckersberg, F. Bak, and F. Widdel, Arch. Microbiol. 156 : 5 - 14, 1991), was studied for its alkane degradation mechanism by using deuterium and 13 C-labeled compounds. Deuterated fatty acids with even numbers of C atoms (C-even) and 13 C-labeled fatty acids with odd numbers of C atoms (C-odd) were recovered from cultures of Hxd 3 grown on perdeuterated pentadecane and [1, 2 - 13 C 2]hexadecane, respectively, underscoring evidence that C-odd alkanes are transformed to C-even fatty acids and vice versa. When Hxd 3 was grown on unlabeled hexadecane {{in the presence}} of [13 C]bicarbonate, the resulting 15 : 0 fatty acid, which was one carbon shorter than the alkane, incorporated a 13 C label to form its carboxyl group. The same results were observed when tetradecane, pentadecane, and perdeuterated pentadecane were used as the substrates. These observations indicate that the initial attack of alkanes includes both carboxylation with <b>inorganic</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> and the removal of two carbon atoms from the alkane chain terminus, resulting in a fatty acid one carbon shorter than the original alkane. The removal of two terminal carbon atoms is further evidenced by the observation that the [1, 2 - 13 C 2]hexadecane-derived fatty acids contained either two 13 C labels located exclusively at their acyl chain termini or none at all. Furthermore, when perdeuterated pentadecane was used as the substrate, the 14 : 0 an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} 1) a methodology {{for the green}} synthesis of a class of methylammonium and methylphosphonium ionic liquids (ILs), 2) how to tune their acid–base properties by anion exchange, 3) complete neat-phase NMR spectroscopic characterisation of these materials and 4) their application as active organocatalysts for base-promoted carbon– carbon bond-forming reactions. Methylation of tertiary amines or phosphines with dimethyl carbonate leads {{to the formation of}} the halogen-free methyl-onium methyl carbonate salts, and these can be easily anion-exchanged to yield a range of derivatives with different melting points, solubility, acid–base properties, stability and viscosity. Treatment with water, in particular, yields bicarbonate-exchanged liquid onium salts. These proved strongly basic, enough to efficiently catalyse the Michael reaction; experiments suggest that in these systems the bicarbonate basicity is boosted by two orders of magnitude with respect to <b>inorganic</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> salts. These basic ionic liquids used in catalytic amounts are better even than traditional strong organic bases. The present work also introduces neat NMR spectroscopy of the ionic liquids as a probe for solute– solvent interactions as well as a tool for characterisation. Our studies show that high catalytic efficacy of functional ionic liquids can be achieved by integrating their green synthesis, along with a fine-tuning of their structure. Demonstrating that ionic liquid solvents can be made by a truly green procedure, and that their properties and reactivity can be tailored to the point of bridging the gap between their use as solvents and as catalysts.

40|$|An alkane-degrading, sulfate-reducing {{bacterial}} strain, AK- 01, {{isolated from}} a petroleum-contaminated sediment was studied to elucidate its mechanism of alkane metabolism. Total cellular fatty acids of AK- 01 were predominantly C {{even when it}} was grown on C-even alkanes and were predominantly C odd when grown on C-odd alkanes, suggesting that the bacterium anaerobically oxidizes alkanes to fatty acids. Among these fatty acids, some 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -methylated fatty acids were specifically found only when AK- 01 was grown on alkanes, and their chain lengths always correlated with those of the alkanes. When [1, 2 - 13 C 2]hexadecane or perdeuterated pentadecane was used as the growth substrate, 13 C-labeled 2 -Me- 16 : 0, 4 -Me- 18 : 0, and 6 -Me- 20 : 0 fatty acids or deuterated 2 -Me- 15 : 0, 4 -Me- 17 : 0, and 6 -Me- 19 : 0 fatty acids were recovered, respectively, confirming that these monomethylated fatty acids were alkane derived. Examination of the 13 C-labeled 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -methylated fatty acids by mass spectrometry showed that each of them contained two 13 C atoms, located at the methyl group and the adjacent carbon, thus indicating that the methyl group was the original terminal carbon of the [1, 2 - 13 C 2]hexadecane. For perdeuterated pentadecane, the presence of three deuterium atoms, on the methyl group and its adjacent carbon, in each of the deuterated 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -methylated fatty acids further supported the hypothesis that the methyl group was the terminal carbon of the alkane. Thus, exogenous carbon appears to be initially added to an alkane subterminally at the C- 2 position such that the original terminal carbon of the alkane becomes a methyl group on the subsequently formed fatty acid. The carbon addition reaction, however, {{does not appear to be}} a direct carboxylation of <b>inorganic</b> <b>bicarbonate.</b> A pathway for anaerobic metabolism of alkanes by strain AK- 01 is proposed...|$|E

Using high-throughput functional gene array (GeoChip v 4. 2) and Illumina 16 S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing, we investigated the phylogenetic and functional microbial {{community of the}} initial inoculum and biocathode for bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene to less toxic aniline in response to carbon source switchover (from organic glucose to <b>inorganic</b> <b>bicarbonate).</b> Selective transformation of nitrobenzene to aniline maintained in the bicarbonate fed biocathode although nitrobenzene reduction rate and aniline formation rate were significantly decreased compared {{to those of the}} glucose-fed biocathode. When the electrical circuit of the glucose-fed biocathode was disconnected, both rates of nitrobenzene reduction and of aniline formation were markedly decreased, confirming the essential role of an applied electric field for the enhancement of nitrobenzene reduction. The stress of poised cathode potential condition led to clear succession of microbial communities from the initial inoculum to biocathode and the carbon source switchover obviously changed the microbial community structure of biocathode. Most of the dominant genera were capable of reducing nitroaromatics to the corresponding aromatic amines regardless of the performance mode. Heterotrophic Enterococcus was dominant in the glucose-fed biocathode while autotrophic Paracoccus and Variovorax were dominant in the bicarbonate-fed biocathode. Relatively higher intensity of diverse multi-heme cytochrome c (putatively involved in electrons transfer) and carbon fixation genes was observed in the biocarbonate-fed biocathode, likely met the requirement of the energy conservation and maintained the nitrobenzene selective reduction capability after carbon source switchover. Extracellular pilin, which are important for biofilm formation and potential conductivity, had a higher gene abundance in the glucose-fed biocathode might explain the enhancement of electro-catalysis activity for nitrobenzene reduction with glucose supply. Dominant nitroaromatics-reducing or electrochemically active bacteria and diverse functional genes related to electrons transfer and nitroaromatics reduction were associated with nitrobenzene reduction efficiency of biocathode communities in response to carbon source switchover.

Microbial mats are living homologs of stromatolites; thus, the physiology of the microbiota as well as the processes which create those features of mats (e. g., biomarker organic compounds, elemental and stable isotopic compositions) which are preserved in the ancient record. Observations of the carbon isotopic composition (delta C- 13) of stromatolites and microbial mats were made and are consistent with the hypothesis that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have declined by at least one to two orders of magnitude during the past 2. 5 Ga. Whereas delta C- 13 values of carbonate carbon average about 0 permil during both the early and mid-Proterozoic, the delta C- 13 values of stromatolitic organic matter increase from an average of - 35 between 2. 0 and 2. 6 Ga ago to an average of about - 28 about 1. 0 Ga ago. Modern microbial mats in hypersaline environments have delta C- 13 values typically in the range of - 5 to - 9, relative to an <b>inorganic</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> source at 0 permil. Both microbial mats and pur cultures of cyanobacteria grown in waters in near equilibrium with current atmospheric CO 2 levels exhibit minimal discrimination against C- 13. In contrast, hot spring cyanobacterial mats or cyanobacterial cultures grown under higher CO 2 levels exhibit substantially greater discrimination. If care is taken to compare modern mats with stromatolites from comparable environments, {{it might be possible to}} estimate ancient levels of atmospheric CO 2. In modern microbial mats, a tight coupling exists between photosynthetic organic carbon production and subsequent carbon oxidation, mostly by sulfate reduction. The rate of one process fuels a high rate of the other, with much of the sulfate reduction occurring within the same depth interval as oxygenic photosynthesis.

40|$|Although buffer agents {{alone have}} failed to improve the suc-cess of resuscitation, we now examine the widely held concept {{that it is the}} {{combined}} effect of alkaline buffer and adrenergic agents that improves outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion. In the present report, the effects of both CO 2 -consuming and CO 2 -generating buffer agents in combination with adren-ergic vasopressor drugs were investigated. Ventricular fibrilla-tion was electrically induced in Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 450 and 550 g. Precordial compression and mechan-ical ventilation were initiated after 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation. Animals were then randomized to receive bolus injections of either <b>inorganic</b> sodium <b>bicarbonate</b> buffer, or-ganic tromethamine buffer, or saline placebo. The b 1 adrener-gic effects of epinephrine were blocked with esmolol. The va-sopressor amine was injected 2 min after injection of the buffer agent.

In 15 additional animals, the se-quence of administration of the adrenergic vasopressor and buffer agents was reversed such that the adrenergic vasopres-sor was injected before the buffer agents. All animals were restored to spontaneous circulation. Both bicarbonate and tromethamine significantly decreased coronary perfusion pres-sure from 26 to 15 mm Hg and reduced the magnitude of the vasopressor effect of the adrenergic vasopressor.

Seasonal dynamics of soil phosphorus (P) and associated microbial properties were investigated in upper (0 - 5 cm) soils under adjacent unimproved grassland and a 19 -year-old forest stand (mixture of Pinus ponderosa and Pinus nigra). Afforestation of grassland ameliorated upper soil moisture and temperature regimes, resulting in reduced but less variable soil moisture beneath forest, and reduced temperature extremes, with soil being cooler under forest in summer, but warmer in winter. Results {{from this study}} showed that levels of soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and organic P fractions under grassland were consistently higher, but levels of <b>inorganic</b> P fractions (<b>bicarbonate</b> extractable Pi and total Pi), microbial biomass C and P, and phosphatase enzyme activities were lower compared with forest over all seasons. Similar seasonal patterns of soil P fractions under grassland and forest demonstrated that labile organic P was mineralized by increasing microbial activity to meet increasing plant demand in spring and summer, but accumulated as a result of increased organic inputs, slower plant growth and low microbial activity in late autumn and winter. It was concluded that P recycling was mainly driven by plant P demand and sustained by root litter inputs in the grassland ecosystem and leaf litter inputs in the forest ecosystem. Seasonal changes in environmental conditions (rainfall, soil moisture and temperature) influenced microbial processes involved in P cycling. Microbial biomass plays a pivotal role in P cycling. Annual release of P through microbial biomass was higher in the forest soil (16. 1 kg ha- 1) than in the grassland soil (13. 9 kg ha- 1). The turnover rate of biomass P was also higher in the forest soil (1. 28 per year) than in the grassland soil (0. 80 per year).

40|$|Background:Autopsies of Egyptian and Chinese mummies have {{demonstrated}} the existence of gallstones for at least 3, 500 years. Today, gallstones occur commonly, especially in the West and in westernized societies. Gallstone complications include biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus. Gallstone disease exacts {{a considerable amount of}} financial and social burden worldwide. Gallstones lead to frequent physician visits and hospitalizations. In 2000, more than 750, 000 outpatient visits in the United States were due to gallstones. In the same year, gallstone disease (defined as cholelithiasis with acute cholecystitis) was the most common inpatient diagnosis among gastrointestinal disorders, with more than 250, 000 hospitalizations, a median inpatient charge of 11, 584 (Russo, 2004) and an estimated annual cost of almost 6. 5 billion. Notably, cholecystectomy is the most common elective abdominal operation performed in the United States, with more than 700, 000 performed annually. Prevalence of gallstones:It has been estimated that in the United States approximately 20 million persons harbor gallstones. Gallstones, cholecystectomies, and gallbladder disease are more prevalent in women than in men at all ages (Everhart, 1999). The prevalence of gallstones varies widely in different countries and among different ethnic groups living in the same country. The highest rates occur among American Indians (Everhart, 1998), especially the Pima Indians of North America, Scandinavians, and Mexican-American women (Maurer, 1989, Everhart, 1999). The lowest rates are seen among African Americans. Although rarer in the non-westernized world, the prevalence of cholelithiasis increased in African (Adedeji, 1986) and Asian countries (Su, 1992) during the 20 th century. For example, the prevalence of gallstones in Tokyo has more than doubled since the 1940 s; a shift from pigment to cholesterol gallstones has also been observed. It has been theorized that this increase is due to nutritional and environmental changes, i. e. the westernization of the diet (increased consumption of imported food, decreased fiber and protein intake, increased fat intake) and the decreased rate of chronic biliary infections. The type of gallstone also varies among populations. For example, cholesterol stones (found primarily in the gallbladder) are more prevalent in developed countries, whereas pigment gallstones (found primarily in the bile ducts) are more common in developing countries of Africa and Asia. Composition of gallstones:All gallstones consist of poorly soluble components of bile that precipitate on a 3 -dimensional matrix of mucins and proteins. Precipitants include cholesterol, calcium bilirubinates, and calcium salts of phosphate, carbonate or palmitate. The matrix consists of large, polymeric mucin glycoproteins and small, amphipathic polypeptides. Based on their composition, gallstones are categorized as cholesterol, black pigment, and brown pigment, with each category having a unique structural, epidemiologic and risk factor profile. The pathogenesis of each type of stone is defined based on the physical-chemical properties of each stone and their differences result mainly from changes in the lipid and lipopigment composition of gallbladder bile. Bile metabolism:In order to understand the pathogenesis of gallstones, one must be familiar with the role of bile, bile acids and the importance of enterohepatic circulation. Bile is formed in hepatic lobules and is an isotonic fluid whose electrolyte composition resembles that of blood plasma. It is then secreted into a complex network of canaliculi, small bile ductules, and larger bile ducts. Bile acids are carried from the liver through these ducts to the gallbladder, where they are stored for future use. The composition of bile in the gallbladder differs from that of hepatic bile because water and <b>inorganic</b> anions (chloride, <b>bicarbonate)</b> are reabsorbed across the gallbladder epithelium. The solute composition of bile in the gallbladder includes approximately 80...|$|R

Il a été réalisé sur les lagunes anaérobies de l' Ecosite de Mèze (Hérault, France). Les lagunes anaérobies constituent un traitement primaire satisfaisant avec des rendements moyens de 55 % pour les MES et 30 % pour la DBO 5, pour une faible emprise au sol. Le taux d'accumulation des boues est de seulement 0, 017 m 3 /EH. an, notamment du fait de l'efficacité de la dégradation anaérobie. L'équilibre du métabolisme anaérobie des boues est atteint après un an de fonctionnement. L'accumulation des boues se fait alors de façon saisonnière avec une forte accumulation en hiver et une digestion du stock en été. Cette évolution est liée à l'influence de la température sur la méthanogénèse. La production de biogaz (83 % CH 4) a pu être mesurée par des collecteurs à gaz mis au point pour cette étude et dépend également fortement de la température. Le bilan du carbone {{montre que}} 74 % du carbone organique épuré est converti en CH 4, 13 % en carbone inorganique dissous et seulement 15 % est stocké dans les boues. Toutefois, les lagunes anaérobies présentent un risque de créer des nuisances olfactives dues à l'émission de H 2 S. This project examined {{the application of}} anaerobic ponds for the primary treatment of urban wastewater under a Mediterranean climate. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine removal performances and to study sludge accumulation and the production of biogas. Together, these results allowed us to calculate the carbon mass balance in the anaerobic ponds. This work was carried out in the two large primary anaerobic ponds of the waste stabilization pond system at the Ecosite of Mèze (Hérault, France), treating domestic wastewater for 13, 800 person-equivalents (PE). Anaerobic ponds were 5, 000 m 3 in volume, 3. 1 m in depth and presented a retention time of 4. 6 d with a mean volumetric organic loading of 83 g BOD 5 /m 3 ×d× The characteristics of the influent and effluent (including: suspended solids (SS); chemical oxygen demand (COD); biological oxygen demand (BOD 5); bicarbonate (HCO 3 -); total organic carbon (TOC); and volatile fatty acids (VFA)) were determined twice-monthly. The volume of sludge and its characteristics (including: SS; volatile solids (VS); TOC; and VFA) were measured monthly. The production of biogas and its composition (CH 4, CO 2, H 2 S) were measured with gas collectors specially developed for this study. Results showed that the anaerobic ponds constituted a good primary treatment with mean removal rates of 55 % for SS, 30 % for BOD and 22 % for COD. Removal performances were relatively constant over the year. Indeed, removal rates were essentially due to the removal of particulate organic matter by sedimentation. Anaerobic degradation occurred essentially in the sludge layer and the removal of soluble COD was low. The study of sludge characteristics showed that anaerobic digestion equilibrium was reached after one year of operation. The beginning of methanogenesis could be observed by the decrease in the concentration of volatile fatty acids. The accumulation of sludge showed seasonal variation with an important accumulation in winter and the digestion of the accumulated stock in summer. This evolution could be related to the influence of temperature on methanogenesis. The mean rate of sludge accumulation was only 3. 8 g SS/P-E×d or 0. 017 m 3 /P-E×yr. This rate was significantly lower than for the primary settling tank (50 - 60 g SS/P-E×d) and for the facultative ponds (0. 085 m 3 /P-E×yr) due to the intensive anaerobic degradation. The production of biogas was measured by gas collectors specially developed for this study. The biogas contained essentially CH 4 (83 %); CO 2 was less than 4 % because it dissolved in the water column and was converted into bicarbonate alkalinity. The concentration of H 2 S was less than 1 % (between 75 and 4770 ppm) but was the cause of unpleasant odours. The biogas production rate was strongly dependent on temperature. A non-linear relationship was obtained (Ebiogas= 4. 8451 × e 0. 1203 T, r 2 = 0. 92, n= 16). The mean annual biogas production rate was calculated to be 49 L/m 2 ×d. Seasonal variation in the biogas production rate could be related to seasonal variations in sludge accumulation. The carbon mass balance showed that 74 % of the removed organic carbon was converted into CH 4, 13 % into dissolved <b>inorganic</b> carbon (<b>bicarbonates)</b> and only 15 % was stored in sludge. The mass balance was well equilibrated and did not show the entry of atmospheric CO 2, which occurs in aerobic ponds where CO 2 is used by algae to produce their cell biomass. In an anaerobic pond, the low production of sludge was due to the efficiency of the anaerobic degradation but also to the low internal biomass production. To conclude, the use of a primary anaerobic pond was advantageous and permitted a reduction in the required surface area for a waste stabilization pond system.

40|$|This project {{focused on}} the {{development}} of an integrated biological system for the treatment of acidic and metal-laden effluents, based on the sustainable biological generation of reactive alkaline species. Initial studies concentrated on the binding and accumulation of heavy metals by biomass of the cyanobacteria, Spirulina sp. Metal binding was rapid, with saturation reached in 30 minutes, and followed an affinity series of Pb > Cu > Zn >>Fe. The binding capacity of the Spirulina for each of the metals was relatively low when compared to a range of other biosorbents. The toxicity thresholds of the algae was determined for copper and zinc. These were low (10 umoles/g) and as such, the algae were not suitable for application in a treatment system in which they came into direct contact with the toxic metals. The algae were able to increase the pH of the surrounding medium. This occurred {{as a result of the}} accumulation of <b>inorganic</b> carbon, from <b>bicarbonate,</b> as a response to low concentrations of carbon dioxide in the medium. The resulting release of a hydroxide ion into solution led to the increase in pH. The increase in pH was shown to be due to a reduction in acidity, rather than an increase in alkalinity. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase was shown to be pivotal in this system. Attempts to determine the enzyme activity directly were unsuccessful, due to the inherent inaccuracy of the assay system. An indirect method of determining enzyme activity, by measuring changes in the carbonate species equilibrium, was developed. Under optimal conditions Spirulina was able to reduce the acidity by an amount equivalent to the addition of 3670 umoles NaOH g·' h·'. Predictive modelling showed that this enhanced the potential of the medium to effect metal precipitation. For the algal system to be sustainable, a readily available source of bicarbonate was needed. This was achieved by the oxidation of organic carbon, under sulphidogenic conditions, by a bacterial consortium isolated from the anaerobic component of a facultative pond. The consortium was shown to consist of sulphate reducing (most likely Desulvovibrio and Desulfotomaculum) and acetogenic bacteria. Sulphate removal rates of 500 mg 1 ·' day·' and 135 mg 1 ·' day·' were achieved in a 21 agitated and 281 upflow reactor respectively. The bicarbonate generation rate in the 281 reactor was calculated as 4033 umoles 1 ·' day·', which proved sufficient to act as a feed for the algal system. Sparging the anaerobic digester overflow with air and nitrogen resulted in a reduction in the aqueous sulphide concentration. Using nitrogen, a 70 % recovery of sulphide, as H 2 S gas, was achieved in 60 minutes, while with air, this dropped to 40 %, due to the oxidation of the aqueous sulphide. The stripping ofH 2 S resulted in an increase in pH. The H 2 S gas was used for the selective precipitation of copper and lead in the integrated system. The dynamics of metal precipitation was investigated. For simple reactions, between individual IV metal and base species, it was possible to generate an accurate predictive model and confirm the precipitating species using wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS). In more complex systems, where precipitation of the artificial acid mine drainage was examined, the predictive modelling and WDS could not accurately describe the system. The addition of aqueous sulphide to copper and iron resulted in the formation of metastable, amorphous precipitates, which remained in suspension. Ageing of the copper precipitate resulted in the evolution of a stable crystalline structure (covellite) and the aggregation and settling of the precipitate. In the case of iron, the amorphous precipitate underwent oxidation before a stable iron sulphide could evolve and the settled precipitate was an iron oxide or oxyhydroxide. The artificial acid mine drainage was treated with sulphide, hydroxide, anaerobic digester overflow and algal overflow. The best metal removal was achieved with the sulphide and hydroxide, while the algal overflow outperformed the anaerobic digester overflow. The precipitate generated by the addition of sulphide was the most compact, followed by the algal overflow, the anaerobic digester overflow and the hydroxide. Efficient precipitation of all the heavy metals, except manganese, was achieved using the algal overflow at an acidity to alkalinity ratio of 1 : 2. This ratio was selected for use in the pilot system. The Spirulina based pilot system was effectively used to treat an effluent from the Black Mountain base metal mine. The necessity to maintain the algae in suspension and avoid biomass washout were practical considerations which counted against this system. The replacement of the Spirulina by Oscillatoria, which adhered to a solid support, overcame these problems. The integrated biological system was able to effectively treat an artificial acid mine drainage for 90 days, reducing the concentration of all metals, except manganese, to below the acceptable environmental risk levels. The treatment of the final effluent in a second anaerobic digester reduced the manganese concentration to 4. 5 uM and proved that the sulphate reducing bacteria could be cultivated on enriched, partially treated acid mine drainage. The integrated biological treatment system performed well, effectively treating an effluent modelled closely on the quality of the water being discharged from the East Rand Basin. The cost of such a system would be considerably less than a "high tech" physico-chemical system. This, coupled with the potential long term sustainability of a biological system, would make it a potentially attractive option for the treatment of future acid mine drainage discharges...|$|R
