40|$|International audienceThe {{adoption}} {{and use of}} a professional social media network by <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> {{is the focus of}} this paper. We draw on resource-based theory, institutional economic theories of incentives and externalities and multidisciplinary literatures on franchising, innovation {{adoption and}} interorganizational communication to link (i) franchisor characteristics and partnering strategies to the adoption and use of a professional social media network and (ii) the extent of use of this network by a franchisor to the number of followers of its network page. Hypotheses are empirically assessed using data on 500 US <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> from Entrepreneur’s Annual Franchise 500 for 2011, content analysis of LinkedIn pages for 317 <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> in 2011 and number of followers in 2015. One key finding is that franchisor adoption of LinkedIn is positively influenced by <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> size, <b>franchising</b> fees and franchisor marketing communications and negatively affected by franchise concept complexity. A second important finding is that, among franchisors who adopt LinkedIn, the extent of use of LinkedIn is positively impacted by <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> size, <b>franchising</b> fees and negatively affected by <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> age. A third notable finding is that the number of followers of a franchisor’s LinkedIn page in the short term is positively impacted by the extent of information about <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> and recruitment. A fourth key finding is that the number of followers in the longer term (2015) is positively impacted by whether the franchisor had a presence on LinkedIn in 2011 and, for these franchisors, by the number of followers in 2011...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{draws on}} the dynamic {{capabilities}} approach to explain the performance of <b>franchised</b> <b>chains.</b> This approach is a useful lens to understand why some chains {{are more likely to}} drive superior performance than others. Hence, using this theoretical lens, we explore why and how several characteristics of <b>franchised</b> <b>chains</b> influence sales performance. This study includes 189 retail and service chains operating in the United States. Findings show that experience before franchising, length of training, <b>chain</b> age, <b>franchising</b> fees, and level of internationalization positively impact performance of <b>franchised</b> <b>chains,</b> whereas the proportion of franchised units has a curvilinear influence (inverted-U shape) on chains' performance.

The database has 54 Brazilian <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> with international operations in 26 countries, which implies in 157 franchises operating abroad. Regarding external environment factors, the independent variables form a group divided into market opportunity and business efficiency – trust and ease to doing business. The result of the three distinct clusters show how the market opportunity and the business efficiency (trust and ease in doing business) work as drivers to the international operation of Brazilian franchises. The paper shows that the <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> operating in the USA (cluster 3) have an inferior international commitment in comparison with the franchises which operate in developed countries and in small Latin American countries (cluster 2). It is also possible to notice a large number of franchises that operate in underdeveloped countries from Latin America and Africa (cluster 1) with worse business efficiency due to the advantage of learning how to operate in a country that could have some similarities with Brazi...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a new model {{allowing}} the implementation of a benchmarking process that jointly measure the efficiency of <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> and determine their optimal organizational form. The methodology is based on a non-econometric technique developed by management scientists on economic concepts for evaluating the performance of decision-making units and implementing a benchmarking process. An extended model is developed in the paper for evaluating the efficiency and determining the optimal percentage of company-owned outlets (PCO) of each <b>franchise</b> <b>chain.</b> First, results showed that the PCO has a positive impact on <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> efficiency; even if other chain characteristics have a larger impact. Second, the optimization of the PCO allows for additional improvements in efficiency. Even though this study has some limitations (e. g. sample and variable selection), it contributes to the literature on franchising by providing an approach allowing us to answer to the question of Shane (1998) on the optimal proportion of franchised units given other firm characteristics. By developing a model that allows for the joint evaluation of <b>franchise</b> <b>chain</b> efficiency and optimal PCO, this study offers to franchisors a new benchmarking process allowing for both a competitive and functional benchmarking. The originality of this research can be found in the new model developed for allowing a benchmarking of <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> that allows an evaluation of efficiency jointly with a determination of their optimal organizational form...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{continued}} {{creation of}} websites in the franchise sector is inevitable, {{no matter whether}} they are informational or transactional websites. However, {{with the presence of}} these websites, there may be a risk that activities in the franchisees’ stores will decrease. Franchisors need to be attentive to the survival of their chains, to the consistency and uniformity of their chains and to potential conflicts with their franchisees or among their franchisees. This chapter deals with the development of websites within <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> in Europe. After briefly defining the legal regulations set by the European Union, the chapter considers the use of the Internet as a new marketing channel by studying the reasons why <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> need to be present on the Internet and under what conditions. Then the chapter discusses potential issues related to transactional websites opened by franchisors, e. g., encroachment problems and transactional websites opened by franchisees.

For that purpose, 64 contracts held by different <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> operating in Spain have been taken as a sample. The results indicate, on the one hand, that {{there are two kinds of}} contracts in terms of their degree of complexity and, on the other hand, that i) the larger the relationship-specific investments, ii) the broader the experience of the chain in the market, and iii) the more important the effort of the person in charge of the outlet is to the success of the business, the more complex the contracts drawn up by the franchisors will be. The franchisor’s reputation, however, does not appear to influence the degree of detail with which the contract is drawn up. Key words...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} level of {{delegation}} in <b>franchise</b> <b>chains,</b> distinguishing the two most relevant franchising models: Business Format Franchising and Learning Network Franchising. The two models basically differ on {{the level of}} real authority (effective control over decisions) exercised by the franchisors. Differences in business features, such as the required standardization, monitoring costs and consumer sensitivity to variations in product attributes (consumer measurement costs), explain the adoption of the different models of franchising. These variables affect the trade-off between the risk of brand name loss and the gains in knowledge sharing and learning within the network. The higher the need for standardization, the higher is the risk of brand name loss, and, consequently, the more likely the franchisor will adopt an organizational design that confers more control over franchisees’ decisions, such as business format franchising. This paper presents two case studies with Brazilian food <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> that illustrate the main argument and suggest additional propositions. Moreover, an empirical analysis of 223 <b>franchise</b> <b>chains</b> provides additional support to the hypothesis of a negative the effect of required standardization {{on the level of}} delegation...|$|R
