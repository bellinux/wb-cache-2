Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
25|$|Some aphid colonies also harbour other {{bacterial}} symbionts, {{referred to}} as secondary symbionts due to their facultative status. They are vertically transmitted, although some studies demonstrated the possibility of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> (from one lineage to another and possibly from one species to another).

25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{symbiosis}} between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are {{an important aspect of}} both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it {{is in the best interest}} of the endophyte to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end of the continuum. Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‘seed defence theory’.|$|E

We define <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmissions</b> as changes that are generated by linkages among fuels at a similar stage of processing while vertical transmissions are changes that are generated by upstream/downstream linkages in the oil supply chain. Here, we investigate vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmissions</b> by estimating vector error correction models (VECMs) that represent relationships among {{the price of crude}} oil, US refinery utilization rates, US stocks of crude oil, US stocks of motor gasoline, the US price of motor gasoline, and the US price of a substitute fuel, natural gas. Causal relationships estimated from both weekly and quarterly observations indicate that the price of crude oil is an important gateway for disturbances to the oil supply chain. Impulse response functions indicate that disturbances to crude oil prices ripple down the oil supply chain and affect inventory behaviors, refinery utilization rates, and the price of motor gasoline, and are transmitted laterally to the natural gas market.

40|$|Abstract Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) is prevalent in Thailand, causing {{a huge impact}} on the country's swine industry. Yet the diversity and origin of these Thai PRRSVs remained vague. In this context, we collected all the Thai PRRSV sequences described earlier and incorporated them into the global diversity. The results indicated that PRRSVs in Thailand were originated from multiple introductions involving both Type 1 and Type 2 PRRSVs. Many of the introductions were followed by extensive geographic expansion, causing regional co-circulation of diverse PRRSV variants in three major pig-producing provinces. Based on these results, we suggest (1) to avoid blind vaccination and to apply vaccines tailor-made for target diversity, (2) to monitor pig importation and transportation, and (3) to implement a better biosecurity to reduce <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmissions</b> as three potentially effective strategies of controlling PRRS in Thailand. </p...|$|R

Hosts that use <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in order to obtain}} cyanobacteria will typically acquire a large and diverse cyanobiont population.

50|$|In H. tvaerminnensis <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> occurs {{after the}} host’s death, when spores from {{decaying}} cadaver suspend in the water. Spores can {{persist in the}} environment, being able to infect new hosts after extended periods of time. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> could not be observed in the lab for H. magnivora but it is suggested to happen in nature as witnessed in H. tvaerminnensis. Both parasite species are vertically transmitted to asexual host offspring with a transmission rate of up to 100% and a somewhat lower transmission rate to sexual offspring (transmission rates have only been reported for H. tvaerminnensis). This means that the parasite is hardly lost in a clone lineage and also survives inside the resting eggs of its host. Thereby it can be kept in a population even though the host is resting while the habitat is dried up or frozen. Because of its combined vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmission</b> strategies, H. tvaerminnensis can reach prevalence of up to 100% in asexual populations in nature {{as well as in}} the laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the multicarrier transmission in one {{particular type of}} underwater acoustic channels, which have extremely long delay spreads (e. g. around one second) but clustered multipath arrivals (e. g., two clusters). These channels show up in certain practical scenarios, {{such as in the}} deep water <b>horizontal</b> <b>transmissions</b> and in the underwater broadcasting networks, and introduce both interblock interference and intercarrier interference (IBI/ICI) in the received signal. For joint IBI and ICI mitigation, we propose a factor-graph based equalization method, in which estimation of information symbols is performed via messages passing over a well-designed graph. We also present a sparse channel estimator by treating the two clusters of the long channel as two virtual quasisynchronous channels. Both channel estimation and equalization are integrated into a progressive receiver framework. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the receiver performance in both deep water horizontal channels and underwater broadcasting networks.

40|$|Journal ArticleCultural {{psychologists have}} shown that people from Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) {{countries}} often exhibit different psychological processing to people from less-WEIRD countries. The former exhibit more individualistic and less collectivistic social orientation, and more analytic and less holistic cognition, than non-Westerners. Yet the mechanisms responsible for maintaining this cultural variation are unclear. Immigration is an ideal 'natural experiment' for uncovering such mechanisms. We used a battery of psychological measures previously shown to vary cross-culturally to compare the social orientation and cognitive style of 286 residents of East London from three cultural backgrounds: (i) 1 st-generation British Bangladeshi immigrants; (ii) 2 nd-generation British Bangladeshis raised in the UK to Bangladeshi-raised parents; and (iii) non-migrants whose parents were {{born and raised in}} the UK. Model comparison revealed that individualism and dispositional attribution, typical of Western societies, are driven primarily by <b>horizontal</b> cultural <b>transmission</b> (e. g. via mass media), with parents and other family members having little or no effect, while collectivism, social closeness and situational attribution were driven by a mix of vertical/oblique cultural transmission (e. g. via family contact) and <b>horizontal</b> cultural <b>transmission.</b> These individual-level transmission dynamics can explain hitherto puzzling population-level phenomena, such as the partial acculturation of 2 nd-generation immigrants on measures such as collectivism (due to the mix of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> cultural <b>transmission),</b> or the observation in several countries of increasing individualism (which is transmitted horizontally and therefore rapidly) despite little corresponding change in collectivism (which is transmitted partly vertically and therefore more slowly). Further consideration of cultural transmission mechanisms, in conjunction with the study of migrant communities and model comparison statistics, can shed light on the persistence of, and changes in, culturally-variable psychological processes.
