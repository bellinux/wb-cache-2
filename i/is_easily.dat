5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E

5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E

5|$|Memling's style {{does not}} lend itself well to {{assigning}} dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 St John Altarpiece, whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more {{in keeping with the}} mature style of the late 1480s.|$|E
5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E
