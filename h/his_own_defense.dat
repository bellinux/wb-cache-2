5|$|The {{reactions}} to Robin No.181 included negative commentary from political commentator and scholar, Roderick Long, and Alan Grant himself. Among fans who interacted with Nicieza in a forum discussion, some responses were also negative, prompting responses from Nicieza in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He {{asked the}} court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to {{determine}} the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.|$|E
50|$|The next {{reason is}} that role {{reversal}} prevents the protagonist from being trapped in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b> Yablonsky provides another example about the fight within spouses. Through role reversal, the spouses change their positions with the other and then produce new insight of the whole interaction. This technique helps the protagonist to gain more understanding of a significant other rather than being stuck in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> perspective.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendant}} {{must have}} the ability to aid his or her attorney in <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|R
50|$|Strecker {{was unable}} to fund <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense</b> and, {{with the help of}} Daniel Caro, created a legal defense fund. According to his website CubaDave.com, Strecker was able to raise a total of $1500.00, and needed to raise an {{additional}} $1500.00 used to pay his legal expenses.|$|R
5|$|When Romero's {{committee}} intensifies its investigation, Underwood {{tries to}} divert their attention by ordering troops into Syria on {{the pretense of}} preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> Columbus upon his return, had manacles placed on his wrists and chains placed on his ankles and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 49 years old.|$|E
50|$|On June 15, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence hired Cullen as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{personal}} criminal <b>defense</b> {{attorney in}} matters relating to {{investigations of the}} Trump administration.|$|R
5000|$|On July 7, 2010, {{less than}} one week before the {{beginning}} of preliminary hearings in his trial before a military commission, Khadr fired his entire team of lawyers and announced that he would act as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense.</b> Later in the month, Khadr accepted Lieutenant Colonel Jon S. Jackson as his lead defense counsel.|$|R
50|$|Suffering {{from public}} humiliation {{as well as}} being kicked out of the house by his wife (because of her money), Pil-seong decides to train himself in {{fighting}} Gi-tae. When taking taekwondo lessons one day, Pil-seong learns that {{the upper part of the}} human rib cage is the vulnerable area of taking his opponents down. He later buys himself <b>his</b> <b>own</b> handgun as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>defense</b> weapon.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} had {{originally intended to}} try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due {{to the findings of}} a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which had concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Wooten {{pled guilty}} to income tax evasion, after having been indicted on charges in 2001 {{that he had not}} filed or paid taxes between 1995 and 1998. He earlier had been judged {{incapable}} of assisting in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> after filing incomprehensible sovereign citizen paperwork with the court.|$|E
25|$|In Griffin v. California (1965), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{prosecutor}} may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's refusal to testify in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.|$|E
50|$|This reign {{also came}} to an end quick, Gómez being handed his 3rd loss at the hands of young Alfredo Layne by {{knockout}} in 9 rounds. Layne lost the title in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> first <b>defense</b> to South Africa's Brian Mitchell, and it became obvious Gómez's best years had gone by, so he retired after this fight.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of friends, Kumalo obtains a lawyer for Absalom and {{attempts}} to understand what his son has become. John, however, makes arrangements for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> son's <b>defense,</b> even though this split will worsen Absalom’s case. When Kumalo tells Absalom's pregnant girlfriend what has happened, she is saddened by the news, but she joyfully agrees to his proposal that she marry his son and return to Ndotsheni as Kumalo's daughter-in-law.|$|R
5000|$|Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C+". He {{felt that the}} show was [...] "so close to saying out loud that Red is Elizabeth’s father that any other {{explanation}} for his interest in her is likely to ring hollow" [...] He was confused about General Ludd's character, noting [...] "that he gives Red a convenient whipping boy to whom he can deliver <b>his</b> <b>own</b> heartfelt <b>defense</b> of capitalism".|$|R
25|$|In this case, the defendant's {{ability to}} {{understand}} {{the charges against him}} and his ability to assist in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> was challenged on five separate occasions before and during his trial and sentencing for capital murder, but the trial judge ruled he was competent to stand trial because he did not meet Oklahoma's high standard of proof.|$|E
25|$|Singh mounted <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> {{and filed}} {{an abuse of}} process motion after the {{prosecution}} failed to disclose more than 30 unedited videos taken by surveillance cameras {{the day of the}} protest. He put it to the court that the videos showed inconsistencies with the evidence given by security guards and supported his version of events.|$|E
25|$|After his arrest, Einhorn {{fled the}} country and spent 23 years in Europe before being extradited to the US. He took the stand in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> {{claiming}} his ex-girlfriend {{had been killed by}} CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and is currently serving a life sentence.|$|E
5000|$|Paterson later {{responded with}} a poem of <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> {{entitled}} In <b>Defense</b> of the Bush, in which he accused Lawson of representing bush life as nothing but doom and gloom, famously ending with the line [...] "For the bush will never suit you, and you'll never suit the bush." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1865 he aided Mariano Ignacio Prado in {{the seizure}} of the {{presidency}} and served in his administration. In 1867, he in turn overthrew Prado. As president, he re-established constitutional rule and undertook vast projects for national improvement. He granted a monopoly of guano export to a French company and obtained large loans in Europe, yet the lavish expenditures of his administration plunged Peru deep in debt. Balta was deposed and shot by a disgruntled member of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> cabinet, <b>Defense</b> Minister Tomás Gutiérrez during his subsequent coup d'état attempt.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Constitution, the PNL finally agreed to emancipate Romania's Jewish minority. In March 1923, Cuza parted with the PP and set up <b>his</b> <b>own</b> National-Christian <b>Defense</b> League (LANC). This far-right group, later joined by PP right-wingers Ion Zelea Codreanu, Șumuleanu and Brăileanu, was dedicated to antisemitic violence, popularizing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion canard, and welcoming into its ranks the fascist youth. Cuza still held Averescu's ideas of moral order {{as a source of}} inspiration, and the LANC tried to draw traditional PP voters into antisemitism.|$|R
25|$|In February 2011, the Navy Administrative Board {{determined}} that Rocha's accusations were exaggerated and that Toussaint was never questioned or {{given the chance}} to testify in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The three-man board reviewed two days of testimony and ruled that the case was based largely on uncorroborated hearsay. Some witnesses contradicted themselves and Rocha acknowledged getting some of the facts wrong in his Washington Post article and in his original testimony.|$|E
25|$|Chambliss did appeal his conviction, citing {{that much}} of the {{evidence}} presented at his trial—including testimony relating to his activities within the Ku Klux Klan—was circumstantial; that the 14-year delay between the crime and his eventual trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial; and that this delay was a tactic used by the prosecution to gain an advantage over <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> attorneys. This appeal was dismissed on May 22, 1979.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the lawyers}} of Bin al-Shibh {{argued that he}} may be unfit to stand trial and {{participate}} in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four co-accused be stayed until his mental state is determined. They say he has been prescribed psychotropic drugs of the sort that are used to treat schizophrenia. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, {{following}} {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War, Kuropatkin served {{as a member of the}} State Council of Imperial Russia. However, in 1907 he retired to his country house, and wrote <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> yet candid, <b>defense,</b> which was published in a number of books in several languages. The Russian government reportedly confiscated the history he wrote.|$|R
25|$|Brown started <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense</b> fund before resigning, a move he {{said was}} {{necessary}} to protect his family's assets. However, some IAHA insiders claimed {{that this was what}} really led to his ousting. He raised money from breeders for the fund as well as IAHA, creating what some called a conflict of interest. Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, on top of his $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the legal bills. It was claimed that Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of IAHA's own legal counsel.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Rabe {{was arrested}} {{first by the}} Soviet NKVD {{and then by the}} British Army. Both, however, let him go after intense interrogation. He worked {{sporadically}} for Siemens, earning very little. He was later denounced for his Nazi Party membership by an acquaintance. He was stripped of the work permit that he had previously been given by the British Zone, and had to undergo a very lengthy de-nazification process (his first attempt was rejected and he had to appeal) in the hope of regaining the permission to work. He had to pay <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense</b> costs, which depleted his savings.|$|R
25|$|Initial jury {{selection}} began on this date, and would continue until July 9. Several motions {{by the defense}} counsel throughout the {{jury selection}} process that the trial should be moved to a jurisdiction outside of Washtenaw County were rejected by Judge John Conlin, who ruled on June 29 that the 14 {{members of the jury}} selected from Ann Arbor by this date and considered satisfactory by both counsels would serve as jurors throughout the trial. Upon recommendation from his lawyers, Collins chose not to testify in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|Riggins {{appealed to}} the Nevada Supreme Court {{on the grounds that}} forced {{administration}} of Mellaril denied him the ability to assist in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> and gave a false impression of his attitude, appearance, and demeanor at trial. Riggins claimed that the forced medication was not justified, as the State had not demonstrated a need to administer Mellaril nor did it explore less restrictive alternatives to giving him 800 milligrams of the drug each day. However, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Riggins' convictions and death sentence. Riggins then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|DeStefano and his {{associates}} were eventually indicted for the Foreman murder. As in his previous trials, DeStefano had raised {{a large amount of}} public interest with his bizarre behavior. He made demands to represent himself, dressed in pajamas, shouted through bullhorns, and rambled incoherently. DeStefano then started displaying similar behavior in the Foreman trial. The Outfit bosses began to worry DeStefano was not only jeopardizing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> but also the defenses of his other crew members. In a secret meeting, the boss of the Chicago Outfit, Tony Accardo, gave DeStefano's crew permission to kill him.|$|E
50|$|Brown started <b>his</b> <b>own</b> legal <b>defense</b> fund before resigning, a move he {{said was}} {{necessary}} to protect his family's assets.

25|$|Johnston {{knew that}} he could not survive a massive siege of Richmond and decided to attack McClellan. His {{original}} plan was to attack the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, before McDowell's corps, marching south from Fredericksburg, could arrive. However, on May 27, Johnston learned that McDowell's corps had been diverted to the Shenandoah Valley and would not be reinforcing the Army of the Potomac. He decided against attacking across <b>his</b> <b>own</b> natural <b>defense</b> line, the Chickahominy, and planned to capitalize on the Union army's straddle of the river by attacking the two corps south of the river, leaving them isolated from the other three corps north of the river.|$|R
25|$|Johnston, who {{had retreated}} up the Peninsula to the {{outskirts}} of Richmond, knew that he could not survive a massive siege and decided to attack McClellan. His original plan was to attack the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, before McDowell's corps, marching south from Fredericksburg, could arrive. However, on May 27, the same day the Battle of Hanover Court House was fought northeast of Richmond, Johnston learned that McDowell's corps had been diverted to the Shenandoah Valley and would not be reinforcing the Army of the Potomac. He decided against attacking across <b>his</b> <b>own</b> natural <b>defense</b> line, the Chickahominy, and planned to capitalize on the Union army's straddle of the river by attacking the two corps south of the river, leaving them isolated from the other three corps north of the river.|$|R
