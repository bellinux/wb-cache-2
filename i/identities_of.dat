5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> {{metalloids}} {{depend on what}} classification criteria are used. Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|E

In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We discuss an {{consideration}} on <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> diseases {{based on}} an ontological model of diseases as causal chains. Because we define an individual disease is constituted by a causal chain, changes of the causal chain implies changes of the disease. That is, in order to consider an <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> diseases, we have to investigate how an <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> a causal chain changes. For this purpose, we introduce a classification of causal inks and causal chains. Then, we propose an ontological model to deal with <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> diseases as causal chains. It would contribute to the ontological treatment <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> a disease in medical information systems. ...|$|R

All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E

But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at {{what they thought was}} a submarine.|$|E

Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E

Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E

The <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are unrecorded. The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia.
