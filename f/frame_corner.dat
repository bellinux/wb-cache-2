An interface model was used to account for slip between the reinforcement and surrounding concrete. Analysis of previously tested frame specimens, with both spliced and unspliced corner reinforcement, was used to study the overall behavior of the frames; more detailed analysis of only the <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> regions was used to study the influence of the reinforcement splices. The analyses were found to reflect the mechanical behavior of the specimens, and are in good agreement with the test results.

30|$|From {{the frame}} {{behaviour}} observation, {{it was possible}} to find that the existence of simultaneous biaxial moments in the columns resulted in yielding, even though the moments along either of the column's principal axes were lower than uniaxial yield moments.

The effect of the global torsional response on the <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> columns and the varying axial load caused by the overturning moment were different from column to column. Thus, yielding of each column is reached for different steps, which influences the evolution of the overall lateral stiffness of the frame system, increasing the biaxial flexure demands in the corner columns.|$|E

The <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> was made of a solid block of ordinary plywood of the same width as the glulam beams and with plies parallel to {{the plane of the}} frame to avoid splitting due to stress perpendicular to the grain. Hardwood dowels with a diameter of 12 mm and a maximum glued-in length of 120 mm were glued into drilled holes in the plywood corner and glulam beam ends parallel to the grain direction of the beams to form a momentresisting joint. Static bending tests were conducted of frame corners with 100 X 200 mm 2 and 120 X 420 mm 2 beam cross sections. Bending capacities of the joints corresponding to a modulus of rupture of the jointed glulam beams of about 30 MPa were obtained for both closing and opening moments for the small cross sections, and about 22 MPa was obtained for the large cross sections. Simple design models for calculation of joint strength and rotational stiffness are also presented.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo obtain wider {{openings}} {{than those}} provided by Chevron bracing, the braces are cranked {{and connected to}} the <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> by an additional brace to form double y-shaped bracings. However, y-bracings are prone to instability and out of plane buckling, accompanied by low hysteretic energy absorption. An experimental research program, focused on y-bracing, was conducted at the BHRC structural engineering laboratory. Specimens {{presented in this paper}} include three full-scale single bay frames, with symmetric y-bracing of different cross sections and connection types. In addition, one specimen with Chevron bracing was tested as a reference. A quasi-static cyclic loading was applied increasingly until yielding and failure occurred in the specimens. The results show that out-of-plane buckling is the governing mode of behavior, despite differences in the detailing of cross sections and connections. Hysteretic energy dissipation and damping of y-bracing are remarkably improved due to the flexural deformation of brace members. The seismic performance of the three y-braced frame specimens and a reference Chevron-braced frame was assessed using the capacity spectrum method. The results show that the y-braced frame, with double gusset plates, can carry almost 60 % more weight than y-braced frames with single gusset plates...|$|E

40|$|The bond {{mechanism}} between deformed {{bars and}} concrete {{is known to}} be influenced by multiple parameters, such as the strength of the surrounding structure, the occurrence of splitting cracks in the concrete and the yielding of the reinforcement. However, when reinforced concrete structures are analysed using the finite element method, it is quite common to assume that the bond stress depends solely on the slip. A new theoretical model which is especially suited for detailed three-dimensional analyses was developed. In the new model, the splitting stresses of the bond action are included; furthermore, the bond stress depends not only on the slip, but also on the radial deformation between the reinforcement bar and the concrete. In addition, this model includes the simulation of cyclic loading. Steel-encased pull-out tests subjected to reversed cyclic loading were carried out. The tangential strain in the steel tubes was measured to investigate how the splitting stresses are affected by cyclic loading. Based on the results of these tests, several improvements of the model were made. Bar pull-out tests with differing geometries and with both monotonic and cyclic loading were analysed, using the new model for the bond action, and non-linear fracture mechanics for the concrete. The results show that the model is capable of dealing with a variety of failure modes, such as pull-out failure, splitting failure, and the loss of bond when the reinforcement is yielding, as well as dealing with cyclic loading in a physically reasonable way. The new model was used in detailed three-dimensional analyses of <b>frame</b> <b>corners.</b> Until recently, splicing of the reinforcement in <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> had not been allowed by the Swedish Road Administration. Since this had led to reinforcement detailing that was hard to realise on site, it was of interest to examine how splicing of the reinforcement affects the behaviour of the structure. Tests on <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> subjected to closing moments were also carried out. It was found that the analyses could describe the test performance in a reasonable way. The tests and analyses showed that splicing the reinforcement {{in the middle of the}} corner has advantages over splices placed outside the bend of the reinforcement. They also indicated, in agreement with previous work, that provided the splice length is as long as required in the codes, there are no disadvantages in splicing the reinforcement within the <b>corner</b> of a <b>frame</b> subjected to closing moment...|$|R

The influence {{of the type of}} adhesive in the joints with dovetail fitting on bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile and compression loading were considered, and the joints without adhesive were compared. A total of 80 each miter <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> joint specimens with dovetail fitting were made. Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyurethane (PU), and cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesives were used, and 20 specimens were prepared without adhesive (WA) with dovetail fitting.

The data were analyzed statistically. The highest bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile loading (46. 09 Nm) was obtained in the specimens bonded with CA adhesive and the highest bending moment capacity under diagonal compression loading (72. 04 Nm) was obtained in the specimens glued with PVAc adhesive. Other than this, since there is no difference between these and the unbonded joints, the PU adhesive was not effective in increasing the bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile loading, and the PU and CA adhesives were not effective in increasing the bending moment capacity under diagonal compression loadings...|$|E
40|$|The strut-and-tie method (STM) {{is used by}} {{structural}} {{engineers to}} design discontinuity regions of reinforced concrete structures. Using STM, the stress distribution in a concrete member is expressed {{as a set of}} struts, ties, and nodes in a strut-and-tie model. These components are then proportioned and evaluated to develop an appropriate design. One type of node that appears in knee joints (i. e., frame corners) subjected to closing moments is referred to as a curved-bar node. Although curved-bar nodes represent a unique concentration of stresses in a structure, little research focused on curved-bar node design has been conducted. In response to this research need, the current study aims to investigate the behavior of frame corners, and more specifically, how the bend radius of curved bars within knee joints affects the strength and behavior of the joints. To accomplish this, the study includes a database analysis, computer simulations, and an experimental program. Experimental data from past research on reinforced concrete knee joints subjected to closing moments were collected and analyzed. Furthermore, a numerical model of a knee joint was built using finite element analysis software. Lastly, <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> specimens containing reinforcing bars with different bend radii were constructed and will be later tested by applying closing moments. The results of the research program are expected to clarify the evaluation of curved-bar nodes and result in recommendations for the design of knee joints under closing moments...|$|E
40|$|The cyclic strain {{approach}} {{allows the}} fatigue strength assessment of notched components {{on the basis}} of the local elastic-plastic strain in the notch root and the crack initiation life of a correspondingly stressed test specimen on the same material. The approach - developed for notches in the base material - can be applied also to welded joints as proposed by Lawrence. Based on investigations of the cyclic behaviour of the different materials at welded joints, performed by the University of Rostock, computations of the local stress behaviour of structural components were performed (T-joint, <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> with bracket). Emphasis was placed on the question if simple approximation formulae can be used instead of performing extensive finite element calculations. When using Neuber's Rule a relatively good agreement can be achieved for the fillet-welded joints investigated under different loads, if an average material law of the different zones adjacent to the cracked region is assumed (heat-affected zone, weld metal). Due to the plane strain condition, notable plastic strain occurs only under relatively high loads. In addition, investigations concerning the scatter of material data and local weld geometry are described. The scatter of material data can be estimated {{on the basis of}} the cooling down rate expected and the evaluation of weld TTT-diagrams. Regression formulae are given for materials used in shipbuilding. With respect to the local weld geometry, computations of the notch stress were performed by systematically varying the geometry parameter. The scatter of the notch fatigue factor was estimated after evaluating the deviations from an 'ideal' weld profile occurring in practice. The total scatter calculated for an example is of the same order as that usually observed in constant amplitude fatigue tests. (orig.)

40|$|Material models {{based on}} {{fracture}} mechanics together with non-linear finite element analyses {{have been used}} in combination with experiments to study the behaviour of reinforced concrete bridges. The work covers two aspects of interest in the design of concrete bridges. * The shear behaviour was studied in full-scale tests on two highway bridges. The capacities of the bridges were compared with the shear capacities according to the design model in the Swedish concrete code. Non-linear finite element analyses were performed on one of the bridges tested. * The reinforcement detailing in <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> was studied and the alternative of splicing the reinforcement within the <b>corners</b> of a <b>frame</b> bridge was examined in three test series. Non-linear finite element analyses were performed for some of the specimens tested. The objective {{of the study was to}} obtain greater knowledge of the behaviour of concrete bridges for these two aspects, as well as to find out how analyses based on fracture mechanics can be used to improve understanding of this behaviour. A background to the fracture mechanics for concrete and to the models used in the analyses is given. The results of the full-scale shear tests indicate that the design model for shear can predict the capacity for typical shear failures. However, when a combination of shear and moment actions leads to failure, the test results revealed shortcomings in the design models in the Swedish concrete code. A finite element analysis based on the discrete crack approach was performe d successfully up to initiation of the final failure; the analysis showed that the inclined crack leading to failure was initiated at mid-height of the bridge slab. The tests on <b>frames</b> and <b>frame</b> <b>corners</b> included both monotonic and cyclic loading. Reinforcement detailing suitable for portal frame bridges, and also detailing suitable for civil defence shelters, was studied. The test results did not uncover any drawbacks related to splicing of the reinforcement in the <b>frame</b> <b>corners.</b> Some of the test specimens were analysed using a material model for concrete based on fracture mechanics and the smeared crack approach. The finite element analyses were found to reflect the mechanical behaviour of the specimens tested throughout the failure process; the analysis results were in good agreement with the test results. The results from both the analyses and the tests support the idea that it should be feasible to splice the reinforcement within the corner area of a frame bridge. The use of fracture mechanics and non-linear finite element analyses has been shown to be a most powerful tool which, together with a limited number of tests, can increase understanding of the failure process in reinforced concrete structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{major part}} of the work {{presented}} in this thesis is an investigation of the strut and tie method for designing 2 -D in-plane, reinforced concrete structures. Two important issues relating to this method are addressed. Firstly, the issue of visualising an appropriate strut and tie model is dealt with. In many situations {{it may be difficult to}} visualise an appropriate model for a given structural system. Here, a convenient method of visualising strut and tie models is presented. Using elastic finite element analysis, low stressed parts of a structure are removed in a step by step process until the main stress paths, which represent the ties and struts, are defined. The second important issue to be addressed is that of serviceability of the designed structure because the strut and tie model naturally represents a great departure from the elastic stress distribution. Since the strut-tie model is used to design for the ultimate load situation, it is necessary to assess the suitability of the same model in relation to serviceability characteristics of the resulting design. It is important that ductility of the structure should be maintained at ultimate loads while avoiding excessive deflections and cracking at service loads. A wide variety of structures were designed, and to assess the performance of each design, non-linear finite element analysis was used. Verification of some of the numerical results was carried out through physical testing in the laboratory which also allowed the serviceability behaviour of the structures to be assessed. The test program comprised of three corbel joints and two <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> joints. It was concluded that design from the strut and tie method can produce adequate performance both at service and ultimate loads. In terms of ultimate load prediction, the strut-tie method can produce results of comparable accuracy to non-linear finite element analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{public and}} {{construction}} industry professionals {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the environmental damage buildings can cause. As a result the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly building materials and techniques is increasing. Straw bale construction is one such technique. ModCell panels are an innovative way of using straw bales in a prefabricated wall system. As ModCell panels are prefabricated the normal risks associated with straw bale construction (fire, straw getting wet during construction, unfamiliar material) are removed from the building site. The panels consist of a timber frame, braced with steel rods, in-filled with straw bales and the surfaces are then rendered with a lime render. To date ModCell panels {{have been used for}} cladding on framed buildings. However, they are now being developed for low rise domestic load-bearing applications and in order to achieve this sufficient racking shear resistance is required. Previous testing has shown that the corner joints in the panel’s timber frame are a weak point. This first aim of this thesis is to improve the racking shear resistance of ModCell panels through a series of experimental laboratory based tests {{so that they can be}} used for load-bearing applications. This thesis also aims to develop a computer model of load-bearing ModCell panels in order to further understand their structural behaviour and assist with future design and development. Different designs of <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> joints were tested in order to find the most suitable type of joint. Screw connected joints proved to be the strongest and were twice as stiff as the other joint designs tested. Full scale panel racking shear tests were undertaken to assess the overall performance of the panels when using the screw connected joints and establish if they are suitable for load-bearing construction. Both solid panels and panels with window openings were tested. Two types of bracing were used in the test panels, either corner bracing or cross bracing. The corner braced panels were over twice as stiff as panels tested during a previous research project. The corner braced panels were also stiffer than the cross braced panels at the serviceability deflection limit of the panels height/ 500, and was sufficiently stiff to resist the required in plane loading under serviceability conditions. The computer model was developed alongside the structural testing. The model was developed using the Robot Millennium software package and modelled all elements of the panels apart from the straw. It was verified against the laboratory test results and found to be accurate within the serviceability deflection limit of height/ 500. Once material failure occurred in the actual panels the model’s accuracy was reduced as it does not include material failure criteria. The model was then used to undertake a parametric analysis. From this analysis it was found that all the elements modelled have an effect on the stiffness of ModCell panels. Changing the render thickness was found to make the greatest difference on the overall stiffness of the panels. Gusset plate and glued and screwed joint designs were also modelled to find their effect on panel stiffness. From all of the results of this analysis an improved panel was designed and when modelled was 20 % stiffer than the original panel...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures {{designed in}} pre- 1970 s are vulnerable under earthquakes {{due to lack}} of seismic detailing to provide adequate ductility. Typical deficiencies of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures are (a) use of plain bars as longitudinal reinforcement, (b) inadequate anchorage of beam longitudinal reinforcement in the column (particularly exterior column), (c) lack of joint transverse reinforcement if any, (d) lapped splices located just above joint, and (e) low concrete strength. Furthermore, the use of infill walls is a controversial issue because it can help to provide additional stiffness to the structure on the positive side and on the negative side it can increase the possibility of soft-storey mechanisms if it is distributed irregularly. Experimental research to investigate the possible seismic behaviour of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures have been carried out in the past. However, there is still an absence of experimental tests on the 3 -D response of existing beam-column joints under bi-directional cyclic loading, such as corner joints. As part of the research work herein presented, a series of experimental tests on beam-column subassemblies with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s buildings has been carried out to investigate the behaviour of existing reinforced concrete structures. Six two-third scale plane frame exterior beam-column joint subassemblies were constructed and tested under quasi-static cyclic loading in the Structural Laboratory of the University of Canterbury. The reinforcement detailing and beam dimension were varied to investigate their effect on the seismic behaviour. Four specimens were conventional deep beam-column joint, with two of them using deformed longitudinal bars and beam bars bent in to the joint and the two others using plain round longitudinal bars and beam bars with end hooks. The other two specimens were shallow beam-column joint, one with deformed longitudinal bars and beam bars bent in to the joint, the other with plain round longitudinal bars and beam bars with end hooks. All units had one transverse reinforcement in the joint. The results of the experimental tests indicated that conventional exterior beam-column joint with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s building would experience serious diagonal tension cracking in the joint panel under earthquake. The use of plain round bars with end hooks for beam longitudinal reinforcement results in more severe damage in the joint core when compared to the use of deformed bars for beam longitudinal reinforcement bent in to the joint, due to the combination of bar slips and concrete crushing. One interesting outcome is that the use of shallow beam in the exterior beam-column joint could avoid the joint cracking due to the beam size although the strength provided lower when compared with the use of deep beam with equal moment capacity. Therefore, taking into account the low strength and stiffness, shallow beam can be reintroduced as an alternative solution in design process. In addition, the presence of single transverse reinforcement in the joint core can provide additional confinement after the first crack occurred, thus delaying the strength degradation of the structure. Three two-third scale space <b>frame</b> <b>corner</b> beam-column joint subassemblies were also constructed to investigate the biaxial loading effect. Two specimens were deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimens and the other one was deep-shallow beam-corner column joint specimen. One deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimen was not using any transverse reinforcement in the joint core while the two other specimens were using one transverse reinforcement in the joint core. Plain round longitudinal bars were used for all units with hook anchorage for the beam bars. Results from the tests confirmed the evidences from earthquake damage observations with the exterior 3 -D (corner) beam-column joint subjected to biaxial loading would have less strength and suffer higher damage in the joint area under earthquake. Furthermore, the joint shear relation in the two directions is calibrated from the results to provide better analysis. An analytical model was used to simulate the seismic behaviour of the joints with the help of Ruaumoko software. Alternative strength degradation curves corresponding to different reinforcement detailing of beam-column joint unit were proposed based on the test results...|$|E

40|$|Seismically {{vulnerable}} buildings {{constitute a}} major problem for the safety of human beings. In many parts of the world, reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings designed and constructed with substandard detailing, no consideration of capacity design principles, and improper or no inclusion of the seismic actions, have been identified. Amongst those vulnerable building, one particular typology representative of the construction practice of the years previous to the 1970 ’s, that most likely represents the worst case scenario, has been widely investigated in the past. The deficiencies of that building typology are related to non-ductile detailing in beam column joints {{such as the use of}} plain round bars, the lack of stirrups inside the joint around the longitudinal reinforcement of the column, the use of 180 ° end hooks in the beams, the use of lap splices in potential ‘plastic hinge’ regions, and substandard quality of the materials. That type of detailing and the lack of a capacity design philosophy create a very fragile fuse in the structure where brittle inelastic behaviour is expected to occur, which is the panel zone region of exterior beam column joints. The non-ductile typology described above was extensively investigated at the University of Canterbury in the context of the project ‘Retrofit Solutions for New Zealand Multi-Storey Buildings’ (2004 - 2011), founded by the ‘Foundation for Research, Science and Technology’ Tūāpapa Rangahau Pūtaiao. The experimental campaign prior to the research carried out by the author consisted of quasi-static tests of beam column joint subassemblies subjected to lateral loading regime, with constant and varying axial load in the column. Most of those specimens were representative of a plane 2 D frame (knee joint), while others represented a portion of a space 3 D <b>frame</b> (<b>corner</b> joints), and only few of them had a floor slab, transverse beams, and lap splices. Using those experiments, several feasible, cost-effective, and non-invasive retrofit techniques were developed, improved, and refined. Nevertheless, the slow motion nature of those experiments did not take into account the dynamical component inherent to earthquake related problems. Amongst the set of techniques investigated, the use of FRP layers for strengthening beam column joints is of particular interest due to its versatility and the momentum that its use has gained in the current state of the practice. That particular retrofit technique was previously used to develop a strengthening scheme suitable for plane 2 D and space 3 D corner beam column joints, but lacking of floor slabs. In addition, a similar scheme was not developed for exterior joints of internal frames, referred here as ‘cruciform’. In this research a 2 / 5 scale RC frame model building comprising of two frames in parallel (external and internal) joined together by means of floor slabs and transverse beams, with non-ductile characteristics identical to those of the specimens investigated previously by others, and also including lap splices, was developed. In order to investigate the dynamic response of that building, a series of shake table tests with different ground motions were performed. After the first series of tests, the specimen was modified by connecting the spliced reinforcement in the columns in order to capture a different failure mode. Ground motions recorded during seismic events that occurred during the initial period of the experimental campaign (2010) were used in the subsequent experiments. The hierarchy of strengths and sequence of events in the panel zone region were evaluated in an extended version of the bending moment-axial load (M-N) performance domain developed by others. That extension was required due to the asymmetry in the beam cross section introduced by the floor slab. In addition, the effect of the torsion resistance provided by the spandrel (transverse beam) was included. In order to upgrade the brittle and unstable performance of the as-built/repaired specimen, a practical and suitable ad-hoc FRP retrofit intervention was developed, following a partial retrofit strategy that aimed to strengthen exterior beam column joints only (corner and cruciform). The ability of the new FRP scheme to revert the sequence of events in the panel zone region was evaluated using the extended version of the M-N performance domain as well as the guidelines for strengthening plane joints developed by others. Weakening of the floor slab in a novel configuration was also incorporated with the purpose of reducing the flexural capacity of the beam under negative bending moment (slab in tension), enabling the damage relocation from the joint into the beam. The efficacy of the developed retrofit intervention in upgrading the seismic performance of the as-built specimen was investigated using shake table tests with the input motions used in the experiments of the as-built/repaired specimen. Numerical work aimed to predict the response of the model building during the most relevant shake table tests was carried out. By using a simple numerical model with concentrated plasticity elements constructed in Ruaumoko 2 D, the results of blind and post-experimental predictions of the response of the specimen were addressed. Differences in the predicted response of the building using the nominal and the actual recorded motions of the shake table were investigated. The dependence of the accuracy of the numerical predictions on the assumed values of the parameters that control the hysteresis rules of key structural members was reviewed. During the execution of the experimental campaign part of this thesis, two major earthquakes affected the central part of Chile (27 of February 2010 Maule earthquake) and the Canterbury region in New Zealand (22 February 2011 Canterbury earthquake), respectively. As the author had the opportunity to experience those events and investigate their consequences in structures, the observations related to non-ductile detailing and drawbacks in the state of the practice related to reinforced concrete walls was also addressed in this research, resulting in preliminary recommendations for the refinement of current seismic code provisions and assessment guidelines. The investigations of the ground motions recorded during those and other earthquakes were used to review the procedures related to the input motions used for nonlinear dynamic analysis of buildings as required by most of the current code provisions. Inelastic displacement spectra were constructed using ground motions recorded during the earthquakes mentioned above, in order to investigate the adequacy of modification factors used to obtain reduced design spectra from elastic counterparts. Finally a simplified assessment procedure for RC walls that incorporates capacity compatible spectral demands is proposed...|$|E

Testing is done with miniplate-type fuel plates to simulate standard fuel with cladding and matrix in plate-type configurations. In order to seal the dispersion fuel plates, a diffusion bond must exist between the aluminum coverplates surrounding the fuel meat. Four different variations in the standard method for roll-bonding 6061 aluminum were studied. They included mechanical cleaning, addition of a getter material, modifications to the standard chemical etching, and welding methods. Aluminum test pieces were subjected to a bend test after each rolling pass. Results, based on 400 samples, indicate that at least a 70 % reduction in thickness is required to produce a diffusion bond using the standard rollbonding method versus a 60 % reduction using the Type II method in which the assembly was welded 100 % and contained open 9 mm holes at <b>frame</b> <b>corners...</b>|$|R
50|$|The architects called tenders for the Bundaberg AWU {{building}} and the contract awarded to L Edwards in May 1952. Goodsir and Carlyle {{were part of a}} group of modernist architects producing functionalist designs often found in hospitals, schools, and offices in the 1950s. Governments and councils preferred this style, as its association with progress, innovation, efficiency and economy, made it an appealing choice in the post-depression era. Characteristics of the functionalist style in Australia include asymmetrical massing, simple geometric shapes, clean lines, steel <b>framed</b> <b>corner</b> and strip windows, undecorated brick walls, curved external corners, flat cantilevered concrete awnings and low pitched or flat roofs concealed behind parapets. Buildings constructed in Bundaberg at this time include: extensions to the hospital and a new state high school at Kepnock in 1964, a new fire station (1950), the Canegrowers Building (1957), the 1957 4BU Radio Station a new courthouse in 1958 and the Civic Centre built in 1960.|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{concrete}} bridges an important aspect is limiting crack widths, since large cracks can lead to e. g. corrosion and affect the bridge functionality. Restraint forces caused by thermal loads and shrinkage will likely constitute {{a large part of}} the total forces acting on the bridge in crack width design. In this paper, restraint stresses in portal frame bridges are calculated according to Eurocode with simple hand calculation models, 2 D frame models and linear elastic 3 D FE-models. The results are then compared and used in Eurocode crack width design methods. Large tensile restraint stresses were found in the transverse direction close to the <b>frame</b> <b>corners,</b> and the required reinforcement amount significantly exceeded the minimum reinforcement prescribed by codes. The results are however unrealistic since the thermal load distribution is simplified, and the crack width formula does not take the reduction of restraint stresses due to cracking into account. Future studies shall therefore determine a more realistic thermal load distribution and the effects of cracking, in order to create a more accurate linear elastic 3 D FE design method...|$|R
