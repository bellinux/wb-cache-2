25|$|Magnetochemistry is {{concerned}} with the magnetic properties of chemical compounds. Magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound. Compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons.

For first-row transition metals the magnitude of μeff is, to a first approximation, a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons, the spin-only formula. In general, spin-orbit coupling causes μeff to deviate from the spin-only formula. For the heavier transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, spin-orbit coupling cannot be ignored.

50|$|Coordination {{polymers}} exhibit {{many kinds}} of magnetism. Antiferromagnetism, <b>ferrimagnetism,</b> and ferromagnetism are cooperative phenomena of the magnetic spins within a solid arising from coupling between the spins of the paramagnetic centers. In order to allow efficient magnetic, metal ions should be bridged by small ligands allowing for short metal-metal contacts (such as oxo, cyano, and azido bridges).|$|E
50|$|In some materials, {{the atoms}} (with net {{magnetic}} dipole moments) can {{interact with each}} other to align themselves {{even in the absence of}} any external magnetic field when the thermal agitation is low enough. Alignment could be parallel (ferromagnetism) or anti-parallel. In case of anti-parallel, the dipole moments may or may not cancel each other (antiferromagnetism, <b>ferrimagnetism).</b>|$|E

50|$|When a {{magnetic}} field is absent the material has a spontaneous magnetism {{which is the result}} of ordered magnetic moments; that is, for <b>ferrimagnetism</b> one ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in one direction with certain magnitude and the other ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in the opposite direction with a different magnitude. As the magnetic moments are of different magnitudes in opposite directions there is still a spontaneous magnetism and {{a magnetic}} field is present.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the term}} {{ferromagnetism}} {{was used for}} any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment {{in the absence of}} an external magnetic field. This general definition is still in common use. More recently, however, different classes of spontaneous magnetization have been identified when there is more than one magnetic ion per primitive cell of the material, leading to a stricter definition of [...] "ferromagnetism" [...] that is often used to distinguish it from <b>ferrimagnetism.</b> In particular, ...|$|E
5000|$|... in {{the same}} phase. While {{ferroelectric}} ferroelastics (with their associated piezoelectric and electrostrictive coupling) and ferromagnetic ferroelastics (with piezomagnetic and magnetomechanical coupling) are formally multiferroics, these days the term is usually {{used to describe the}} magnetoelectric multiferroics that are simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric. Sometimes the definition is expanded to include non-primary order parameters, such as antiferromagnetism or <b>ferrimagnetism.</b> In addition other types of primary order, such as ferroic arrangements of magneotelectric multipoles of which ferrotoroidicity is an example, have also been recently proposed.|$|E
50|$|In {{materials}} that exhibit antiferromagnetism, the magnetic moments of atoms or molecules, usuallyrelated to the spins of electrons, align {{in a regular}} pattern with neighboring spins (on different sublattices) pointing in opposite directions. This is, like ferromagnetism and <b>ferrimagnetism,</b> a manifestation of ordered magnetism. Generally, antiferromagnetic order may exist at sufficiently low temperatures, vanishing at and above a certain temperature, the Néel temperature (named after Louis Néel, who had first identified this type of magnetic ordering). Above the Néel temperature, the material is typically paramagnetic.|$|E
5000|$|Heusler {{compounds}} are magnetic intermetallics with face-centered {{cubic crystal}} structure and a composition of XYZ (half-Heuslers) or X2YZ (full-Heuslers), where X and Y are transition metals and Z {{is in the}} p-block. Many of these compounds exhibit properties relevant to spintronics, such as magnetoresistance, variations of the Hall effect, ferro-, antiferro-, and <b>ferrimagnetism,</b> half- and semimetallicity, semiconductivity with spin filter ability, superconductivity, and topological insulation. Their magnetism results from a double-exchange mechanism between neighboring magnetic ions. Manganese, which sits at the body centers of the cubic structure, was the magnetic ion in the first Heusler compound discovered.

50|$|Néel {{studied at}} the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and was {{accepted}} at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He obtained the degree of Doctor of Science at the University of Strasbourg. He was corecipient (with the Swedish astrophysicist Hannes Alfvén) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1970 for his pioneering studies of the magnetic properties of solids. His contributions to solid state physics have found numerous useful applications, particularly {{in the development of}} improved computer memory units. About 1930 he suggested that a new form of magnetic behavior might exist; called antiferromagnetism, as opposed to ferromagnetism. Above a certain temperature (the Néel temperature) this behaviour stops. Néel pointed out (1948) that materials could also exist showing <b>ferrimagnetism.</b> Néel has also given an explanation of the weak magnetism of certain rocks, making possible the study of the history of Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|Ferromagnetism is {{the basic}} {{mechanism}} by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets, or are attracted to magnets. In physics, several different types of magnetism are distinguished. Ferromagnetism (including <b>ferrimagnetism)</b> is the strongest type: {{it is the only}} one that typically creates forces strong enough to be felt, and is responsible for the common phenomena of magnetism in magnets encountered in everyday life. Substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism, paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism, but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory. An everyday example of ferromagnetism is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. The attraction between a magnet and ferromagnetic material is [...] "the quality of magnetism first apparent to the ancient world, and to us today".|$|E

Murthy and his team were credited with the discovery of novel magnetic structures and a polarizer for thermal neutrons. His contributions have been reported in the design of neutron facilities of Dhruva reactor and he led a group of scientists who conceptualized and fabricated several components of the reactor. He also contributed in developing superconducting magnets at BARC and his work assisted the in the development of Yafet-Kittel type of <b>ferrimagnetism.</b> His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 23 of them.

5000|$|Type-I multiferroics {{which have}} been {{known for a long}} time are often good {{ferroelectric}}s and antiferromagnetic. They exhibit high ferroelectric and lower magnetic ordering temperatures. Examples are BiFeO3 (TC = 1100 K, TN = 643 K) and YMnO3 (TC = 914 K, TN = 76 K) and probably BiMnO3 and PbVO3. Since ferroelectricity and magnetism develop independently from another, the magnetoelectric coupling between the two is usually weak. In a first approach, they might be regarded as ferroelectrics which happen to be (antiferro)magnetic. However, more recently there have been reports of large magnetoelectric coupling at room-temperature in type-I multiferroics such as in the [...] "diluted" [...] magnetic perovskite (PbZr0.53Ti0.47O3)0.6-(PbFe1/2Ta1/2O3)0.4 (PZTFT) in certain Aurivillius phases, and in the system (BiFe0.9Co0.1O3)0.4-(Bi1/2K1/2TiO3)0.6 (BFC-BKT). Here, strong ME coupling has been observed on a microscopic scale using PFM under magnetic field among other techniques. The latter system, appears to be the first reported core-shell type relaxor ferroelectric multiferroic, where the magnetic structure in so-called [...] "multiferroic clusters" [...] is proposed to be due Fe-Co <b>ferrimagnetism,</b> which can be switched by an electric field.|$|E

For all values of x in the series, the compound crystallizes in orthorhombic Pbnm space group similar to NdMnO 3.

The evolution of magnetic ground states and appearance of <b>ferrimagnetism</b> in Nd 1 -xYxMnO 3 can {{be accounted for by}} invoking the scenario of magnetic phase separation.
