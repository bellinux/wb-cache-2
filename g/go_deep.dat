25|$|The East China Sea and Yellow Sea were Triggers {{objective}} for her seventh patrol. She {{stood out}} of Midway on 22 October and proceeded to her patrol area. At 22:00 on 1 November, she sighted a convoy that was steaming in two columns. When a ship in the nearer column overlapped one in the more distant group, Trigger fired a spread of three torpedoes at them. One torpedo struck the nearer freighter in the bow and one hit the farther ship amidships. The submarine saw the nearer ship go down by the bow, before she herself was forced to <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> where she was severely depth-charged by two escorts.|$|E
25|$|Miami {{continued}} to whittle away the Bills {{lead in the}} third quarter with an 8-play, 62-yard scoring drive, featuring a 17-yard run by Sammie Smith on third and 2. Stoyanovich finished the drive with a 22-yard field goal that cut their deficit down to one score, 27-20. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory. Marino tried to <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> on third down, but Bills safety Mark Kelso picked him off at the Dolphins 48, leading to a 28-yard Norwood field goal that gave the Bills a 30-20 lead.|$|E
25|$|Minnesota {{took the}} opening kickoff and drove 60 yards in 11 plays, {{setting up a}} Gary Anderson field goal. But after the ensuing kickoff, Rams quarterback Kurt Warner on their first play from scrimmage, threw a 77-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Isaac Bruce. A 13-yard sack by Rams safety Billy Jenkins on the Vikings ensuing drive forced a punt, and Warner once again went to work. He threw a 26-yard completion to Bruce and an 11-yarder to Torry Holt before finishing the drive with a 41-yard touchdown pass to running back Marshall Faulk. Another sack, this time by linebacker Charlie Clemons, forced Minnesota to punt again, and once again the Rams decided to <b>go</b> <b>deep,</b> {{but this time the}} Vikings were ready, and cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock intercepted Warner's pass at his own 4-yard line.|$|E

25|$|UCF {{received}} {{the ball with}} 2:04 left in regulation. Bortles made three straight completions {{to move to the}} Temple 30. With 1:06 left, Bortles was under pressure, rolling out to his left. He was hit as he threw, but found J.J. Worton downfield. It appeared Bortles had overthrown his receiver. Worton made a spectacular, one-handed, diving catch, landing just in-bounds to score the game-tying touchdown, a play which made ESPN's SportsCenter Top 10. UCF forced Temple to punt, and {{received the}} ball with 28 seconds left in regulation. Rather than playing for overtime, Rannell Hall urged Bortles in the huddle to <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> against the Temple defense, which appeared unprepared for the play. Bortles connected on a 35-yard pass to Hall, who broke free for a gain of 64 {{all the way to the}} Temple 4 yard line. With 2 seconds left, kicker Shawn Moffitt made a chip-shot field goal, and UCF escaped with an improbable 39–36 victory. It was their fourth comeback win of the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} {{incident}} of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when Onslow was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate {{off the coast}} of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to <b>go</b> <b>deep.</b> Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. Onslow rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} Robert Englund {{would not}} reprise {{the role of}} Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films. On April 3, 2009 Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role. Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown {{for the role of}} Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, [...] "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part." [...] Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for Watchmen; after viewing it, Bayer said it [...] "blew [...] mind", and that he knew Haley would be able to <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> and create a believable character who was a [...] " [...] with a burned face and a claw".|$|E

The Giants led the Chargers 10–7 after three quarters before scoring 10 {{in the fourth quarter}} to put the game out of reach. Joe Morris rushed 30 times for 83yards and defensive backs Terry Kinard and Kenny Hill intercepted two passes each. Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts threw five second half interceptions.

We never got anything established against the Giants. Momma said there would be days like this, and she was right." ...|$|E
500|$|The last {{film that}} Monroe {{completed}} was John Huston's The Misfits, which Miller {{had written to}} provide her with a dramatic role. She played Roslyn, a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by Clark Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The filming in the Nevada desert between July and November 1960 was again difficult. The four-year marriage of Monroe and Miller was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with Inge Morath. Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing scenes the night before filming. Her health was also failing: she was in pain from gallstones, and her drug addiction was so severe that her make-up usually had to be applied {{while she was still}} asleep under the influence of barbiturates. In August, filming was halted for her to spend a week detoxing in a Los Angeles hospital. Despite her problems, Huston stated that when Monroe was playing Roslyn, she [...] "was not pretending to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness." ...|$|E

In October 2016, Derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel, saying, [...] "I love the character, I love the visual possibilities, and I know the comics so well— the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." [...] He would like to follow the example of The Dark Knight and [...] "bring in a villain where you really got to <b>go</b> <b>deep</b> [...] a more visceral experience". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange solo film. Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing Clea appear in a potential sequel. By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, Locke & Key.|$|E
