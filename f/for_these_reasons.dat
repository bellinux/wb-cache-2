5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> was despised by Orozco.|$|E
5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons</b> and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>reasons,</b> , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
