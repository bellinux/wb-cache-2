After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E

50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC uses a wide-angle, DOHC, {{belt-driven}} valvetrain configuration with flat-tappet 33 mm HLA bucket lifters. It is a interference design. There are two {{valve springs}} per valve and four valves per cylinder. While a dual valve spring configuration is used, the stock springs are <b>fairly</b> low-sprung. <b>Low</b> spring rates {{were chosen for}} increased valvetrain longevity and low friction with the dual valve springs for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Saran {{appeared}} in Rowthiram, {{where she worked}} with Tamil actor Jeeva for the first time. The film received <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> reviews. Although some reviews said that Saran was not given much opportunity to show her acting skills, mainly just adding a romantic touch to a mostly violent film, she was referred to by another as the pivot around which the film revolves. Her performance earned her Best Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards. Her only other film in 2011 was a special appearance in a song for the Tamil film Rajapattai.|$|E

In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is <b>fairly</b> <b>low,</b> and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at a <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> level {{after the}} Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E

5|$|Velociraptor was warm-blooded to some degree, as it {{required}} {{a significant amount}} of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September7. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September11 about 800miles (1300km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, {{one of the most}} active single days on record. It existed at a <b>fairly</b> <b>low</b> latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andrés. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior.|$|E

40|$|Respiration and net {{photosynthesis}} of discs excised from cotyledons of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. were measured at temperatures of 17, 21 and 25 °C in a Gilson Respirometer. Cotyledonary material was also analysed for TNC (total non-structural carbohydrates). Rates of respiration and {{net photosynthesis}} {{were significantly different}} at the three temperatures, with the lowest rates recorded in each case at 17 °C and the highest at 25 °C. TNC values revealed an initial decrease, followed by a small increase, and thereafter a drop to <b>fairly</b> constant <b>low</b> levels. While seedlings at 25 °C grew well, very little growth was recorded at 17 °C. Growth at the different temperatures {{was related to the}} relative excess of photosynthesis over respiration. The ecological implications of these results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{stability}} issue in a Cournot duopoly with codetermined firms. We show that when both firms codetermine employment together with decentralised employees' representatives, a rise in wages acts as an economic (de) stabiliser when the wage is <b>fairly</b> (high) <b>low,</b> while under profit maximisation a rise in wages always acts as a stabilising device because the parametric stability region monotonically increases with the wage in such a case. Moreover, {{a rise in the}} union's bargaining power has a de-stabilising effect, except when the wage is low and the firm power is already high. Therefore, under codetermination a change either in the wage or firm power in the Nash bargaining plays an ambiguous role on stability. We also show with numerical simulations that complex dynamics can also occur...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} generating a variety of chemically diverse, broadly responsive, low power vapor sensors. A key to our ability to fabricate chemically diverse sensing elements is the preparation of processable, air stable films of electrically conducting organic polymers. An array of such sensing elements produces a chemically reversible, diagnostic pattern of electrical resistance changes upon exposure to different odorants. Such conducting polymer elements are simply prepared and are readily modified chemically {{to respond to a}} broad range of analytes. In addition, these sensors yield a <b>fairly</b> rapid, <b>low</b> power, de electrical signal in response to the vapor of interest, and their signals are readily integrated with software or hardware-based neural networks for purposes of analyte identification. Principle component analysis has demonstrated that such sensors can identify and quantify different airborne organic solvents, and can yield information on the components of gas mixtures...|$|R
