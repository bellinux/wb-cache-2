40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} of: (1) mortality of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), under different modes {{of exposure to}} the pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., (2) host and environmental factors affecting sporulation, production, and viability of B. bassiana conidia from infected cadavers of CPB larvae, and (3) transmission of the disease in CPB populations. The research leads to an improved understanding of the process of transmission of B. bassiana in CPB populations. This may enhance its use as a biological control agent for this pest insect. The highest rate of mortality of CPB larvae (77 percent) was achieved through direct spray of the insects with conidial suspensions of B. bassiana together with exposure to inoculated foliage. Direct spraying alone resulted in 76 percent mortality and exposure to inoculated foliage resulted in 34 percent. B. bassiana killed larvae sporulated within 2 days after death at 100 percent relative humidity and 25 "C, and produced 1. 75 x lo 4 to 8. 7 x 10 ' conididinsect.

Beginning in 1928 (under an authoritarian regime), popular organizations grew increasingly persistent in their demands for an end to repressive policies. As the movement developed, however, Venezuelan women recognized the necessity of organizing on their own behalf {{in order to ensure that}} future democratic administrations would address their concerns. To that end, women formed organizations to present their concerns, as well as participate in the democratization movement. During periods of authoritarian repression, women utilized gender stereotypes to continue making demands and mobilize (whereas many men could not take the risk), developing organizational and leadership skills, as well as internally debating the focus of their efforts. They relied on language of gender difference to seek legal reform that would grant rights to women as mothers and would allow them to complete "traditional" jobs more efficiently. As the movement progressed and the governmental regime became more tolerant, women expanded their demands to include political, as well as legal, rights. The limited success of a campaign to reform the Código Civil invigorated women's organizations to work explicitly for suffrage, maintaining pressure on the administration, as well as on the male leaders of political organizations. Ultimately, despite myriad challenges, including repressive governmental policies, gender stereotypes and prejudice, and debate over organizational goals and direction, women in Venezuela succeeded in working methodically towards improving legal protections and gaining political rights for wome...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method to {{estimate}} the fraction of stars with chemical composition of <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second(s)</b> generation(s) currently hosted in Galactic globular clusters (GCs). We compare cluster and field stars of similar metallicity in the [Fe/H]-[Na/H] plane. Since the phenomenon of multiple populations is only restricted to the cluster environment, the number of GC stars whose location coincides with that of field stars provides the fraction of first generation stars in that cluster. By exclusion, the fraction of second generation stars is derived. We assembled a dataset of 1891 field stars of the thin disk, thick disk, and halo of the Milky Way in the metallicity range - 3. 15 <= [Fe/H] <= + 0. 48 dex and with Na abundance from high resolution spectra. They are mostly dwarfs, but include also giants. Considering only the range in metallicity spanned by most GCs extensively studied for the Na-O anticorrelation (- 2. 36 <= [Fe/H] <= - 0. 33 dex), we have 804 stars. The total sample is homogeneized by offsets in [Fe/H] and [Na/H] {{with respect to a}} reference sample using the same line list and NLTE correction for Na adopted in a recent extensive survey of GC stars. This fully accounts for offsets among analyses due to different temperature scales, line lists, adopted (or neglected) corrections for departures from LTE. We illustrate our method estimating the fraction of first and second generation stars in the well studied GC NGC 6752. As a by-product, the comparison of [Na/H] values in GC and field stars suggests that at least two classes of old stellar systems probably contributed to the halo assembly: one group with characteristics similar to the currently existing GCs, and the other more similar to the present-day dwarf satellite galaxies.

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} avaliar as inclinações dentárias e o perfil facial de pacientes tratados ortodonticamente com braquete autoligado Damon 2, prescrição padrão. Para este estudo, foi selecionada uma amostra de 18 indivíduos, sendo 12 do sexo masculino e 6 do feminino, com idades que variaram de 12 a 20 anos (idade média de 15 anos) e que apresentavam discrepância de modelo negativa (de 4 mm a 15 mm). Como critério de inclusão, os pacientes deveriam apresentar dentição permanente completa até os segundos molares, má oclusão de Classe I de Angle, telerradiografias em norma lateral do início e final do tratamento ortodôntico e modelos de estudo em gesso dos arcos dentários superiores e inferiores do início e final do tratamento ortodôntico. As medições das inclinações ântero-posteriores dos incisivos centrais superiores e incisivos centrais inferiores e alterações do perfil facial foram realizadas por meio das telerradiografias em norma lateral. As distâncias transversais das regiões de cúspide e cervical inter-caninos, primeiros e segundos pré-molares e primeiros molares, foram obtidas medindo-se os modelos de gesso. Todas as mensurações foram realizadas nas telerradiografias e modelos de gesso obtidos antes do início do tratamento ortodôntico (T 1) e no final do tratamento (T 2). Após a coleta de todos os dados aplicou-se o teste t de Student para comparar as medidas dos dois tempos avaliados neste estudo. Verificou-se diferença estatisticamente significante (p< 0, 05) na inclinação dos incisivos centrais inferiores e nas dimensões transversais inter-cúspides e inter-cervicais dos primeiros e segundos pré-molares e primeiros molares na maxila. Na mandíbula todas as distâncias transversais (intercúspides e cervicais) de caninos, primeiros e segundos pré-molares e primeiros molares apresentaram significância estatística (p< 0, 05), exceto a distância inter-cervical dos caninos inferiores. Concluímos que o tratamento ortodôntico sem extrações de pacientes com má oclusão de Classe I realizados com os braquetes Damon 2, prescrição padrão, não promoveu alteração na inclinação vestíbulo-lingual dos incisivos centrais superiores, aumentou a inclinação vestibular dos incisivos centrais inferiores, não alterou o perfil facial e aumentou de modo significativo a dimensão transversal da maxila e da mandíbula por meio de inclinação vestibular de coroa. (AU) This study {{aimed to}} evaluate the dental inclinations and facial profile of patients treated with orthodontic self-ligating brackets Damon 2, standard prescription. For this study, we selected a sample of 18 subjects, 12 males and 6 females, with ages ranging from 12 to 20 years (mean age 15 years) and who had negative discrepancy model (from 4 mm to 15 mm). As a criterion for inclusion, the patients should have permanent complete dentition until the second molars, Class I Angle malocclusion, cephalometric lateral radiographs before and after orthodontic treatment and dental casts of {{the upper and lower}} dental arches before and after orthodontic treatment. The measurements of buccolingual inclinations of the upper central incisors and lower central incisors and the facial profile changes were made in cephalometric lateral radiographs. The width of the cusp tips and cervical intercanines, <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>seconds</b> premolars and first molars, had been gotten measuring the dental cast. All measurements were made at cephalometric lateral radiographs and dental cast obtained before orthodontic treatment (T 1) and after treatment (T 2). After collected all data was applied Student t test to compare the measures of the two times evaluated in this study. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) in the inclination of lower central incisors and in the intertooth width of intercusp and intercervical of the first and second premolars and first molars in the maxilla. In the mandible all intertooth width (intercusp and intercervical) of canines, first and second premolars and first molars showed statistical significance (p < 0. 05), except the intercervical width of the lower canines. We concluded that the orthodontic treatment without extractions in patients with Class I malocclusion using Damon 2 brackets, standard prescription, did not promote change in the buccolingual inclination of upper central incisors, increased vestibular inclination of lower central incisors, did not change the facial profile and significantly increased the width of the maxilla and mandible by vestibular inclination of the crown.
