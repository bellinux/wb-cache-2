Mixtures of these reagents when used as freshly prepared solutions afforded ratios of products that indicated negligibly small differences among the rates of the various competitive coupling reactions. However, studies of reagent stability in solution revealed that both types of the N-isobutyryl deoxyguanosine reagent decompose faster than their corresponding dA, dC, and dT phosphoramidites, which led to significantly lower proportions of dG-containing sequences.

40|$|When hydroquinone-O,Ooffiacetic acid {{is used as}} {{a linker}} arm in solid phase {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis, the time for NH 4 OH cleavage of oligodeoxy- or oligoribonucleotides is reduced to only 2 min. This allows increased productivity on automated <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesizers</b> without requiring any other modifications to existing reagents or synthesis and deprotection methods. The Q-linker may also be rapidly cleaved by milder reagents such as 5 % NH 4 OH, potassium carbonate, anhydrous ammonia, t-butylamine or fluoride ion. However, the Q-linker is sufficiently stable for long-term storage at room temperature without degradation and no loss of material occurs during synthesis. The linker is also reasonably resistant to 20 % piperidine/DMF, 0. 5 M DBU/pyridine and 1 : 1 triethylamine/ethanol. The Q-linker can therefore serve as a general replacement for both succinyl and oxalyl linker arms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{developed}} {{a method to}} make a various high quality random peptide libraries for evolutionary protein engineering based on a combinatorial DNA synthesis.

It required only standard DNA synthetic reagents and standard <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesizers</b> in three lines. This multi-line split DNA synthesis (MLSDS) is simply realized by adding a mix-and-split process to normal DNA synthesis protocol. Superiority of MLSDS method over other methods was shown. We demonstrated the synthesis of oligonucleotide libraries with 10 16 diversity, {{and the construction of}} a library with random sequence coding 120 amino acids containing few stop codons.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of use of automated <b>DNA</b> <b>synthesizers</b> (i. e. the number of oligomers prepared per day), we have devised and prepared novel phosphoramidite reagents that contain a linking group which, while stable under the normal synthesis conditions, is cleaved under basic conditions. When one of these linkers is introduced at the desired position in the synthesis of an oligonucleotide, subsequent detritylation enables the synthesis of a second oligonucleotides sequence upon the first. During deprotection of the oligonucleotide with ammonium hydroxide, the chain is cleaved at either side of the points of introduction of the novel reagent, generating two oligonucleotides free in solution. These reagents are of particular use in applications where oligomers are used in pairs (such as PCR, chemical synthesis of genes etc.) and means that an automated synthesis facility can be used more efficiently, without the need for operator intervention, after the working day is over...|$|R
40|$|DNA-templated few-atom silver {{nanoclusters}} (DNA/Ag NCs) are a {{new class}} of organic/inorganic composite nanomaterials whose fluorescence emission can be tuned throughout the visible and near-IR range by simply programming the template sequences. Compared to organic dyes, DNA/Ag NCs can be brighter and more photostable. Compared to quantum dots, DNA/Ag NCs are smaller, less prone to blinking on long timescales, and do not have a toxic core. The preparation of DNA/Ag NCs is simple and {{there is no need to}} remove excess precursors as these precursors are non-fluorescent. Our recent discovery of the fluorogenic and color switching properties of DNA/Ag NCs have led to the invention of new molecular probes, termed NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), for DNA detection, with the capability to differentiate single-nucleotide polymorphisms by emission colors.
