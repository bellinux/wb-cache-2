5000|$|The {{birth of}} {{homeopathy}} {{was based on}} cinchona bark testing. The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, when translating William Cullen's Materia medica, noticed Cullen had written that Peruvian bark was known to cure intermittent fevers. Hahnemann took daily a large, rather than <b>homeopathic,</b> <b>dose</b> of Peruvian bark. After two weeks, {{he said he felt}} malaria-like symptoms. This idea of [...] "like cures like" [...] was the starting point of his writings on homeopathy. Hahnemann's symptoms are believed {{to be the result of}} a hypersensitivity to cinchona bark on his part.|$|E

40|$|Gelsemium sempervirens {{is used in}} {{homeopathy}} {{for treating}} patients with anxiety related symptoms, however {{there have been few}} experimental studies evaluating its pharmacological activity. We have investigated the effects of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>doses</b> of G. sempervirens on mice, using validated behavioral models. Centesimal (CH) dilutions/dynamizations of G. sempervirens, the reference drug diazepam (1 [*]mg/kg body weight) or a placebo (solvent vehicle) were intraperitoneally delivered to groups of mice of CD 1 strain during 8 days, then the effects were assessed by the Light-Dark (LD) choice test and by the Open-Field (OF) exploration test, in a fully blind manner. In the LD test, the mean time spent in the illuminated area by control and placebo-treated animals was 15. 98 %, for mice treated with diazepam it increased to 19. 91 % (P =. 047), while with G. sempervirens 5 CH it was 18. 11 % (P =. 341, non-significant). The number of transitions between the two compartments increased with diazepam from 6. 19 to 9. 64 (P <. 001) but not with G. Sempervirens. In the OF test, G. sempervirens 5 CH significantly increased the time spent and the distance traveled in the central zone (P =. 009 and P =. 003, resp.), while diazepam had no effect on these OF test parameters. In a subsequent series of experiments, G. sempervirens 7 and 30 CH also significantly improved the behavioral responses of mice in the OF test (P <. 01 for all tested variables). Neither dilutions of G. sempervirens affected the total distance traveled, indicating that the behavioral effect was not due to unspecific changes in locomotor activity. In conclusion, <b>homeopathic</b> <b>doses</b> of G. sempervirens influence the emotional responses of mice to novel environments, suggesting an improvement in exploratory behavior and a diminution of thigmotaxis or neophobia...|$|R
40|$|Biodynamic {{farming is}} the oldest organic farming {{movement}} in Germany. Since Dr. Rudolf Steiner’s “Course on Agriculture” held in 1924, the number of biodynamic farmers in Germany has grown continuously, with 1, 317 farmers currently producing on 47, 592 ha. One of the most distinctive aspects of biodynamic farming {{is the use of}} the so-called biodynamic preparations, which are applied in <b>homeopathic</b> <b>doses.</b> Biodynamic preparations are supposed to improve plant growth and food quality, minimising natural variations. This paper deals with investigations of influences of these preparations and increased manure application on potato yield and tuber quality. The results are drawn from extensive research on organic potato production carried out by several institutes of the University of Bonn, sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Bonn), and the Eden Foundation (Bad Soden) ...|$|R
40|$|In 1849, Charles Darwin was so ill that he {{was unable}} to work one out of every 3 days, and after having various troubling {{symptoms}} for 2 – 12 years, he wrote to a friend {{that he was}} ‘going the way of all flesh’. He sought treatment from Dr James Manby Gully, a medical doctor who used water cure and homeopathic medicines. Despite being highly skeptical of these treatments, he experienced a dramatic improvement in his health, though some of his digestive and skin symptoms returned various times in his life. He grew to appreciate water cure, but remained skeptical of homeopathy, even though his own experiments on insectivore plants using what can be described as <b>homeopathic</b> <b>doses</b> of ammonia salts surprised and shocked him with their significant biological effect. Darwin even expressed concern that he should publish these results. Two of Darwin’s sons were as incredulous as he was, but their observations confirmed the results of his experiments. Darwin was also known to have read a book on evolution written by a homeopathic physician that Darwin described as similar to his own but ‘goes much deeper. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: Homeopathic {{medicine}} developed significant {{popularity in}} the nineteenth century in the United States and Europe {{as a result of its}} successes treating the infectious disease epi-demics during that era. Homeopathic medicine is a medical system that is specifically oriented to using nanopharmacologic and ultramolecular doses of medicines to strengthen a person’s im-mune and defense system rather than directly attacking the microbial agents. Objectives: To review the literature referenced in MEDLINE ™ and in nonindexed homeo-pathic journals for placebo-controlled clinical trials using homeopathic medicines to treat peo-ple with AIDS or who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive and to consider a dif-ferent theoretical and methodological approach to treating people with the viral infection. Findings: A total of five controlled clinical trials were identified. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 50 asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects (stage II) and 50 sub-jects with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (stage III) in whom individualized single-remedy homeopathic treatment was provided. A separate body of preliminary research was conducted using <b>homeopathic</b> <b>doses</b> of growth factors. Two randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies were conducted with a total of 77 people with AIDS who used only natural therapies over a 8 – 16 -week period. Two other studies were conducted over a 2. 5 -year period with 27 subjects in an open-label format. Settings: The first study was conducted by the Regional Research Institute for Homoeopath...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the nanoparticle-cross-adaptation-sensitization (NPCAS) model for homeo-pathic remedy actions in living systems. The model builds upon an extensive interdisciplinary scientific literature outside conventional biomedicine. The way in which homeopathic remedies are made, involving trituration with or without succussion, is a type of top-down mechanical manufacturing process for nanoparticles (NPs, measuring < 100 nanometers in diameter) of source material. Chikramane et al (2010) documented the presence of source nanoparticles in commercial homeopathic remedies. NPs acquire unique biological, chemical, electromagnetic, and quantum properties as a function of their high ratio of surface area to volume. Their ability to cross cell membranes and adsorb other materials onto their highly reactive surfaces makes them excellent herb, nutriceutical, drug, and vaccine delivery vehicles with enhanced bio-availability. Nanoforms of materials lower the dose needed even for conventional medical applications. For <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dosing,</b> very low doses of NPs can mobilize hormetic adaptational mechanisms in complex living systems by serving as novel, foreign stressors to stimulate beneficial compensatory responses in the organism as a whole. The organism’s adap-tive responses grow and evolve over time via nonlinear metaplastic and plastic sensitization mechanisms in bodily cells across the endogenous, self-organized network of the dynamical living system. The primary pathways involve adaptive reactions rather than direct pharmacological actions. Taken together, the evidence-based NPCAS model offers a testable, scientifically-grounded foundation for advancing homeopathic clinical care and research...|$|R

40|$|June 2007 {{sees the}} {{publication}} of revised Royal College of Physician’s guidelines {{on the use of}} radioactive iodine in hyperthyroidism. The original guidelines, produced in 1995 by a College Working Party, represented the bodies involved in the admin-istration of radioiodine (131 I). 1 The need for these guidelines emerged from the outcome of a survey, reported in this Journal, which showed considerable variation within the UK in the doses of radioiodine used to treat hyperthyroidism, ranging from almost <b>homeopathic</b> through to <b>doses</b> sufficiently large to cause concern over unnecessary use of radiation. 2 The original guidelines had a major impact on the way radioiodine is given, leading to more uniformity and far better information provision for patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{scientific}} studies have confirmed {{the action of}} homeopathic high dilutions in living organisms an endless debate on {{the choice of the}} most fitting dilution, the frequency of administration and the dose (amount of medicine) still remains. Aims: This study sought to assess the in vivo effect of 2 different concentrations of Arsenicum album 30 cH in order to elucidate some problems in the <b>homeopathic</b> notion of <b>dose.</b> Methods: Male Wistar rats previously intoxicated with sodium arsenate by peritoneal injection were treated with undiluted Ars 30 cH and Ars 30 cH in 1 % solution administered by oral route. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was employed to measure the levels of arsenic retained in the animals as well as the amounts eliminated through urine. Urine samples were collected before and after and during treatment. A positive control group (intoxicated animals) and negative control group (non-intoxicated animals) were administered only the vehicle used to prepare the medicine (ethanol). Results: The groups treated with undiluted Ars 30 cH and Ars 30 cH in 1 % solution eliminated significant amounts of arsenic through urine when compared to the control groups. The group treated with undiluted Ars 30 cH eliminated significantly higher amounts of arsenic than the group treated with the same medicine in 1 % solution. Conclusion: These results suggest that undiluted Ars 30 cH was more effective than in 1 % solution in this experimental model...|$|R
