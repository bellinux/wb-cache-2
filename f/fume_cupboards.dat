40|$|Abstract. A <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> is {{equipment}} {{used to carry}} out chemical reaction process in its working chamber. A suction fan takes air or gas from the working chamber and releases it outside. When the air or gas is flowing from the inlet to the outlet, some recirculation zones may be formed depending on the internal shape design of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> This recirculation zone may create back flow that can {{be the cause of}} leakage. Leakage happens when airborne contaminants escape through inlet of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> to the user breathing zone and the surrounding air in the room. To have a good <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> the recirculation zone needs to be minimised. In this paper, the flow characteristic of a Servco <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> will be presented as a result of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using κ-ω turbulence model.

A push flow {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the doorsill are adopted to form an air curtain in the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of push flows to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over blow modes. According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard.

40|$|The flow {{separation}} and its accompanied recirculation induced when the airflow passes over the inappropriately designed doorsill {{of a chemical}} fume cupboard are the key factors which would lead to deterioration of the cupboard performance. In order to alleviate the contaminant leakage of the fume cupboard induced by inherent aerodynamic deficiency, a technique using doorsill jet injection is developed and validated. A planar jet is ejected upward through a slot located across the inner surface of the doorsill of a full-scale, transparent fume cupboard and is ejected upward. The laser-light-sheet-assisted smoke flow visualization is performed to explore the physical mechanism of changing and controlling the flow structure. It is found that the up-ward injected jet is curved by the airflow drawn into the sash opening and forms a layer of clean air which can isolate the contaminant and alleviate the diffusion through the recirculating vortex on the doorsill, if the jet velocity is properly adjusted. The tracer gas concentration measurements present extraordinarily satisfactory results—the order of magnitude of the leak-age of tracer gas near the doorsill may be reduced from original levels of 102 to 1022 p. p. m.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated pollutant distributions in fume hoods. Currently, most exhaust fume hoods are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and pollutant distributions in an exhaust fume hood with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> successfully captures pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|R

The large-scale vortex structures exist around the side walls, the doorsill of the cupboard and {{in the vicinity of}} the nearwake region of the manikin.

Several existing tracer gas containment test methods (BS 7258 : 1994, prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 and ANSI/ASHRAE 110 : 1995) are conducted to verify the effectiveness of these methods in detecting the contaminant leakage. By comparing the results of the flow visualization and the tracer gas tests, it is found that the local recirculation regions are more prone to contaminant leakage because of the complex interaction between the shear layers and the smoke movement through the mechanism of turbulent dispersion.

Manufacturers of contamination control equipment have the expense of testing by varying methods in dierent countries where standards apply. Ultimately, it is hoped that there will be either one standard method for testing all open fronted containment facilities, or, if there are dierent methods, that they yield results which can be compared.

The highly turbulent jet-like currents are induced by the unsteady flow motion near the cupboard face. Large-scale turbulent eddies accompanied with the jet-like currents obviously bring large amount of in-cupboard smoke out to the atmosphere. The turbulent mixing extends the size {{and the strength of}} the large-scale eddy circulations, and predominantly contributes to the mechanism that causes the severe spread of contaminant leakage in few seconds.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. This {{study was}} {{launched}} because of alarming conditions in laboratories {{and lack of}} general occupational health and safety. Employees are exposed {{to a number of}} chemicals for extended periods of time, and these employees aren't completely informed of the risks involved in working with the hazardous substances. There is a general lack of awareness and concern about employee health and safety in the workplace, especially in laboratories. In this study personal and environmental sampling was conducted in three subject groups with the highest potential risk. With the sampling employee or environmental exposure to ten chemicals could be quantified. Questionnaires were used to assess employee as well as health and safety representative's general knowledge of occupational health and safety. In the course of this study it was found that employees are exposed to low concentrations {{of a wide variety of}} chemicals during the workday. The exposure to a combination of chemicals leads to an exceedingly high concentration of overall volatile organic substances. The exposure to these low concentrations takes place over a number of years for permanent employees. During the workday employees are also exposed to short periods of very high concentrations of hazardous chemical substances. These short term exposure levels are complicated to compare with international standards because of the lack of standards available. 'Therefore it is difficult to determine if an employee's exposure does exceed the international limits, and therefore it is difficult to control or prevent this short term exposure. The long term exposure to these hazardous chemical substances may lead to serious detrimental health effects, which often only develop years after exposure occurred. The biggest concern for employees working with hazardous chemical substances is depression of the nervous system and development of cancer. To prevent these negative health effects it is important to control or minimize employee exposure to hazardous chemical substances during the workday. The institution should launch a thorough investigation to determine employee exposure of the various chemicals during the eight hour workday, but also during the short term exposure periods. Control measiures such as ventilation systems or <b>fume</b> <b>cupboards</b> should be installed or repaired to provide adequate control to minimize employee exposure. Master...|$|E
