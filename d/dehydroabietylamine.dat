5000|$|Leelamine (<b>dehydroabietylamine)</b> is a {{diterpene}} amine {{that has}} weak {{affinity for the}} cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, {{as well as being}} an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Optically active leelamine is also used as a chiral resolving agent for carboxylic acids. [...] Leelamine {{has been shown to be}} effective against certain cancer cells, independent from its activity on Cannabinoids or PDK1. Due to its lysosomotropic property, it accumulates inside the acidic organelles leading to disruption of intracellular cholesterol transport, autophagy and endocytosis followed by cell death.|$|E

Their chemical structures were confirmed in detail by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FT-IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR and HSQC). The curing reactions of these synthesized epoxies with hexahydrophthalic anhydride were studied by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The mechanical properties and thermal {{stability of the}} cured epoxies were investigated by Universal Mechanical Testing Machine, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} bulky fused diterpene structure in <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> led to a weaker molecular motion ability and a lower cross-link density, so that the cured epoxy derived from <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> processed a higher glass transition temperature (167 °C), but lower mechanical properties than those of the benzylamine-based one...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dehydroabietylamine</b> (1) {{was used}} as a {{starting}} material to synthesize a small library of dehydroabietyl amides by simple and facile methods, and their activities against two disease-causing trypanosomatids, namely, Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi, were assayed. The most potent compound, 10, an amide of <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> and acrylic acid, was found to be highly potent against these parasites, displaying an IC 50 value of 0. 37 μM against L. donovani axenic amastigotes and an outstanding selectivity index of 63.

This compound was also highly effective against T. cruzi amastigotes residing in L 6 cells with an IC 50 value of 0. 6 μM and high selectivity index of 58, being 3. 5 times more potent than the reference compound benznidazole.

40|$|Malaria {{caused by}} the Plasmodium parasites {{continues}} to be an enormous global health problem owing to wide spread drug resistance of parasites to many of the available antimalarial drugs. Therefore, development of new classes of antimalarial agents is essential to effectively treat malaria. In this study, the efficacy of naturally occurring diterpenoids, <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> and abietic acid, and their synthetic derivatives was assessed for antimalarial activity. <b>Dehydroabietylamine</b> and its N-trifluoroacetyl, N-tribromoacetyl, N-benzoyl, and N-benzyl derivatives showed excellent activity against P. falciparum parasites with IC 50 values of 0. 36 to 2. 6 μM. Interestingly, N-dehydroabietylbenzamide showed potent antimalarial activity (IC 50 0. 36), and negligible cytotoxicity (IC 50 > 100 μM) to mammalian cells; thus, this compound can be an important antimalarial drug. In contrast, abietic acid was only marginally effective, exhibiting an IC 50 value of 82 μM. Several carboxylic group-derivatives of abietic acid were moderately active with IC 50 values of 8. 2 to 13. 3 μM. These results suggest that a detailed understanding of the structure– activity relationship of abietane diterpenoids might provide strategies to exploit this class of compounds for malaria treatment...|$|E

40|$|A novel unsymmetrically {{substituted}} chiral amphiphilic perylene diimide {{with two}} different quaternary stereocenters was synthesized. For comparison, symmetrically substituted chiral perylene diimide containing the same quaternary stereocenters was prepared.

The 1. 5 {{generation}} hyperbranched molecule was synthesized with <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> as {{the core}} by means of Michael addition reaction and amidation condensation reaction with ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate as raws by divergent method. Then, the dispersant was synthesized {{by means of the}} 1. 5 G hyperbranched molecule as initiator by reaction with 2 -aminoethanesulfonic acid. The structure of products were identified by IR spectra and 1 HNMR spectra. The influences of dispersant on apparent viscosity，rheological behaviour and static stability of coal water slurry prepared from Shenfu coal are studied. The results showed that as the slurry concentration reach at 67 % the dosage of the dispersant was 0. 4 % (m/m), the viscosity of the coal water slurry was only at 987 mPa·s. The rheological investigation indicates that the slurry pumped with dispersant is pseudoplastic fluid...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dehydroabietylamine</b> (1 a), {{the novel}} {{derivatives}} (2 a- 6 a) and their NTf 2 salts (1 b- 6 b) were tested as chiral NMR solvating agents {{for the resolution}} of enantiomers of the model compound Mosher's acid (7) and its n-Bu 4 N salt (8). Best enantiomeric discrimination of 7 was obtained using bisdehydroabietyl-amino-N- 1, N- 2 -ethane- 1, 2 -diamine (6 a), and of 8 using N-(dehydroabietyl) - 2 -(dehydroabietylamino) ethanaminium bis((trifluoromethyl) -sulfonyl) -amide (6 b). For the maximal resolution of enantiomers of 8, 1. 0 eq. of 6 b were needed. However, 0. 5 eq. of 6 a sufficed for the maximal resolution of enantiomers of 7. Enantiomeric excess studies were successfully conducted using 6 a and 6 b. The capability of 6 a and 6 b to recognize the enantiomers of various a-substituted carboxylic acids and their n-Bu 4 N salts were examined.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the major}} concern due to its life threatening and fetal effects. Reported data suggest that it is the fifth most frequent neoplasm and third largest cause of mortality among all the prevailing cancers; with the average life of 6 months after diagnosis including surgical treatment options, suggesting poor prognosis of the disease (Pisani 2002, Sala 2004, Bruix 2005). Alarmingly, around 600, 000 individuals loss their life every year due to HCC and almost same number of new cases registered worldwide per year (Fallopi 2011, Jemal 2005). Because of high prevalence rate of hepatitis B, C and aflatoxin B food contaminated products, especially Asia and subshahran African countries contributing major chunk of the disease (Bosch 2004, Tanaka 2002). So far available therapies are not very successful in terms of both quality and survival; sorafenib, multikinase inhibitor is only FDA approved drug against HCC (Lachenmayer 2009, Keating 2009). Keeping in mind that structural manipulation is still noteworthy and essentially one of the focused technique for drug efficacy enhancement and finding new novel drugs with potentially broad bioactive spectra; new derivatives of <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> (DAA), abietic acid (AB) and oleanolic acid (OA) were synthesized, purified and subjected for cytotoxic effects with special focus of hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening of 40 new derivatives using SRB protocol on breast cancer and HCC cell lines was performed. Preliminary screening findings concluded that <b>dehydroabietylamine</b> derivative- 2 (DAAD- 2) with Nacetyl cysteine in ring A at C- 18 is the most potent derivative among all trial drugs. DAAD- 2 subjected for cytotoxic effects on ten HCCs and one breast cancer cell line. Hep 3 B cells were the most sensitive with IC 50 of 2. 00 Â± 0. 4 Ã¬M on DAAD- 2. Similarly, obvious morphological deviations including detachment of cells, cell rounding and low confluency; and statistically significant time dependent changes in sub-G 1 (8 - 9 fold increase) and G 2 /M phase (2 fold decrease) in Hep 3 B cells after 48 and 72 hours of DAAD- 2 treatment were recorded. Alkaline comet assay was performed to see the single stranded DNA breaks and WHSC 1 gene expression experiments were also performed. The present outcomes also exhibit the structural significance of our trial novel drugs, their vital influence and correlation on cytotoxic and cell proliferation studies. Our current findings provide sufficient evidence that DAAD- 2 induces growth attenuation of HCC cells by apoptotic mechanism of death. Further microarray and invivo studies on anti carcinogenic properties of different kind of cancers including HCC and its mechanism of action can be opted to rationalize the role of DAAD- 2 in future cancer research and therapy...|$|E
