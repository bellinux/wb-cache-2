5000|$|Foraminoplasty is an aware state {{endoscopic}} technique {{developed by}} Martin Knight MD, FRCS, MBBS and team about many years ago. It {{can be used}} to address many pathologies in the raging spine and also failed back surgery. The aware state feedback helped the medical team to discover the true sources of back pain and has allowed to optimise the treatment at each level. The improved kit now allows to undertake multilevel combination foraminoplasty. The medical team of Dr. M. Knight has now many studies developed in years with results described in specialty literature. In the [...] "Endoscopic Foraminoplasty: A Prospective Study on 250 Consecutive Patients with Independent Evaluation", the conclusion is shown as a minimalist means of exploring the <b>extraforaminal</b> zone, the foramen, the disc, and the epidural space and performing discectomy, lateral recess decompression, osteophytectomy, and neural mobilization with the endoscopic laser foraminoplasty utilised in the aware state. It provides identification and accurate localization of the causal source of pain in multilevel disc disease.|$|E
40|$|Study Design. An {{anatomic}} {{study of}} the <b>extraforaminal</b> attachments of the lumbar spinal nerves was performed using human lumbar spinal columns. Objectives. To identify and describe the existence of ligamentous structures at each lumbar level that attach lumbar spinal nerves to structures {{at the level of}} the <b>extraforaminal</b> region. Summary of Background Data. During the last 120 years, several mechanisms to protect the spinal nerve against traction have been described. All these structures involved are located in the spinal canal, proximal to the intervertebral foramen. Methods. Five embalmed human lumbar spines (T 12 -S 1) were used. Bilaterally, the <b>extraforaminal</b> region was dissected to describe and measure anatomic structures and their relationships. Histology was performed with staining on the sites of attachment and along the ligament. Results. The levels T 12 -L 2 show bilaterally 2 ligaments, a superior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligament and an inferior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligament. The superior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligament emerges from the joint capsule of the facet joints and inserts in both, the intervertebral disc and the ventral crista of the intervertebral foramen, passing the spinal nerve laterally. In one specimen on level L 2 -L 3, the superior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligament is not attached to the spinal nerve. The inferior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligament emerges from the intervertebral disc, passing the nerve medially and attaching the spinal nerve. At the levels L 2 -L 5, the inferior <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments are only attached to the intervertebral disc, not to the joint capsule. Histologically, the ligaments consisted of mainly collagenous structures. Conclusion. Ligamentous connections exist between lumbar <b>extraforaminal</b> spinal nerves and nearby structures. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Background: In a {{previous}} study, ligaments that connect the <b>extraforaminal</b> lumbar spinal nerves with the fibrous capsule of the facet joints and the dorsolateral {{side of the}} intervertebral disc were described. This anatomical configuration suggests a mechanical role in transferring <b>extraforaminal</b> spinal nerve traction. Methods: One embalmed human lumbar spine was dissected from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the first sacral vertebra to isolate the twelfth thoracic to the fourth lumbar spinal nerves. The spinal nerves from L 1 to L 4 were pulled at different angles {{with respect to the}} axis of the spine. Forces of 1 - 6 N were applied. The displacements of reflective markers glued to the proximal and distal ends of the adjoining ligaments were recorded with a video system. Findings: The spinal nerve proximal of the <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments stays centred in the intervertebral foramen when pulling at an angle. At levels L 1 -L 4 strain reduction by the <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments was largest when pulling at a wider angle to the spinal axis in the sagittal plane. Proximal to the <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments less displacement was seen compared to the displacement distal of the <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments when pulling in longitudinal direction. A graded decrease in the displacement proximal to the <b>extraforaminal</b> ligaments was seen from the levels L 1 -L 4. Interpretation: <b>Extraforaminal</b> ligaments {{play an important role in}} the prevention of damage due to spinal nerve traction. The proximal attachments secure a spinal nerve position central in the intervertebral foramen and also reduce longitudinal tension. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc {{herniation}} and stenosis {{that results}} in compression of a nerve root lateral to the foramen is defined as <b>extraforaminal.</b> In recent years the recognition of such pathology has increased with technology and greater awareness. Various approaches and techniques {{have been developed for}} <b>extraforaminal</b> decompression in the lumbar region. The {{purpose of this study was}} two fold: 1) Determine the safety of treating patients operatively via a paramedian muscle splitting approach on an outpatient basis, and 2) Highlight the technical aspects of the approach to the <b>extraforaminal</b> region. METHODS: One hundred consecutive <b>extraforaminal</b> decompressions were performed from 1992 to 2007 by a single surgeon. A retrospective review was performed consisting of chart reviews. Summary statistics and the Pierson Chi-square test were used to analyze the data. The primary outcome measure was the need for hospital admission or readmission following surgical decompression. RESULTS: Seven of 100 patients (7 %) were required to remain in the hospital for twenty-three hour observation due to Medicare requirements. Five (5 %) of the patients originally scheduled for an outpatient procedure were converted to inpatient status due to postoperative pain. All were released within 2 days (average 1. 25 days). Only one (1 %) patient was readmitted for urinary retention that resolved without incident. There was no significant difference (P = 0. 137) in complication rate between our control and those that underwent <b>extraforaminal</b> decompression. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Extraforaminal</b> lumbar decompression as an outpatient procedure can be done safely without the need for hospital admission...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} {{the reliability of the}} MRI findings in detecting symptomatic <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniation in the lumbar spine. Overview of Literature: There are no reports of the characteristics and reliable MRI findings of <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniation. Methods: Thirty age-and gender-matched asymptomatic volunteers and 30 patients with symptomatic <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniation, who underwent surgery between March 2006 and Dec 2008, were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent spinal MRI. The following parameters were evaluated: {{the presence or absence of}} focal eccentricity of the disc, change in the diameter of the nerve root, and displacement of the nerve root at the <b>extraforaminal</b> zones. Radiologic studies were reviewed blindly and independently by 3 spine surgeons. Results: The overall agreement in determining the presence or absence of a symptomatic <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniation between the three reviewers was 89. 4 % (161 / 180). The consensus showed focal eccentricity of the disc in 33 cases (55 %), a change in diameter in the nerve root in 31 cases (51. 7 %), and a displacement of the nerve root in 23 cases (38. 3 %). An assessment of the paired intraobserver and interobserver reliability revealed mean Kappa statistics of 0. 833 and 0. 667 for focal eccentricity of the disc, 0. 656 and 0. 556 for a change in the diameter of the nerve root, and 0. 669 and 0. 020 for a displacement of the nerve root, respectively. Conclusions: There are three possible MRI findings that can be used to determine the presence or absence of symptomatic <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniation. Among these MRI findings, focal eccentricity of the disc was found to be the most reliable...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of CT-guided CTSI is {{to inject}} {{medication}} into the foraminal region where the nerve root is inflamed. The optimal location for needle placement and therapeutic delivery, however, remain uncertain. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate how needle positioning and angle of approach impact the transforaminal distribution of injectate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed fluoroscopic images from 90 CT-guided CTSI procedures for needle-tip location, needle angle, and contrast distribution. Needle-tip position was categorized as either foraminal zone, junctional, or extraforam-inal. Distribution of contrast injected immediately before steroid administration was categorized as central epidural, intraforaminal, or <b>extraforaminal</b> in location. Needle-tip location and angle were correlated with contrast distribution. RESULTS: The needle tip was most commonly placed in the junctional position (36 cases, 40 %), followed by foraminal (30 cases, 33 %) and <b>extraforaminal</b> (24 cases, 27 %) locations. Intraforaminal contrast distribution was highest when the needle location was foraminal (30 / 30, 100 %) or junctional (35 / 36, 97 %), compared with <b>extraforaminal</b> (7 / 24, 29 %) (P value. 0001). There was no relationship between needle angle and contrast distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Needle-tip location at the outer edge of the neural foramen (junctional location) correlated well with intraforaminal distribution of contrast for CT-guided CTSI and compared favorably with injectate distribution following foraminal zone needle position-ing. Junctional needle positioning may be preferred over the foraminal zone by some proceduralists. <b>Extraforaminal</b> needle positionin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. <b>Extraforaminal</b> {{decompression}} of the L 5 {{nerve root}} remains a challenge due to anatomic constraints, severe level-degeneration, and variable anatomy. The {{purpose of this}} study is to introduce the use of navigation for transmuscular transtubular decompression at the L 5 /S 1 level and report on radiological features and clinical outcome. Methods. Ten patients who underwent a navigation-assisted <b>extraforaminal</b> decompression of the L 5 nerve root were retrospectively analyzed. Results. Six patients had an <b>extraforaminal</b> herniated disc and four had a foraminal stenosis. The distance between the L 5 transverse process and the para-articular notch of the sacrum was 12. 1 [*]mm in patients with a herniated disc and 8. 1 [*]mm in those with a foraminal stenosis. One patient had an early recurrence and another developed dysesthesia that resolved after 3 months. There was a significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative NRS with the results being sustainable at follow-up. ODI was also significantly improved after surgery. According to the Macnab grading scale, excellent or good outcomes were obtained in 8 patients and fair ones in 2. Conclusions.

40|$|Abstract Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the outcome of endoscopic decompression surgery for intraforaminal and <b>extraforaminal</b> nerve root compression in the lumbar spine. Methods The records from seventeen consecutive patients treated with endoscopic posterior decompression without fusion for intaforaminal and <b>extraforaminal</b> nerve root compression in the lumbar spine (7 males and 10 females, mean age: 67. 9 ± 10. 7 years) were retrospectively reviewed. The surgical procedures consisted of lateral or translaminal decompression with or without discectomy. The following items were investigated: 1) the preoperative clinical findings; 2) the radiologic findings including MRI and computed tomography-discography; and 3) the surgical outcome as evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale for lower back pain (JOA score). Results All patients had neurological findings compatible with a radiculopathy, such as muscle weakness and sensory disturbance. MRI demonstrated the obliteration of the normal increased signal intensity fat in the intervertebral foramen. Ten patients out of 14 who underwent computed tomography-discography exhibited disc protrusion or herniation. Selective nerve root block was effective in all patients. During surgery, 12 patients were found to have a protruded disc or herniation that compressed the nerve root. Sixteen patients reported pain relief immediately after surgery.

There was additional posterolateral protrusion or spinal stenosis {{at the level}} of the lateral herniation in seven and four cases, respectively. The patients were reviewed at three months and two years after surgery. Radiographs showed three grades of facetectomy: grade I, removal of 50 % or less, grade II, excision of 51 % to 75 %, and grade III, subtotal or total facetectomy.

40|$|Large lumbosacral disc herniations effacing {{both the}} paramedian and the {{foraminal}} area often cause double radicular compression. Surgical management of these lesions may be difficult. A traditional interlaminar approach usually brings into view only the paramedian {{portion of the}} intervertebral disc, unless the lateral bone removal is considerably increased. Conversely, the numerous far-lateral approaches proposed for removing foraminal or <b>extraforaminal</b> disc herniations would decompress the exiting nerve root only. Overall, these approaches share the drawback of controlling the neuroforamen on one side alone. A combined intra-extraforaminal exposure is a useful yet rarely reported approach. Over a 3 -year period, 15 patients with bi-radicular symptoms due to large disc herniations of the lumbar spine underwent surgery through a combined intra-extracanal approach. A standard medial exposure with an almost complete hemilaminectomy of the upper vertebra was combined with an <b>extraforaminal</b> exposure, achieved by minimal drilling of the inferior facet joint, the lateral border of the pars interarticularis and the inferior margin of the superior transverse process. The herniated discs were removed using key maneuvers made feasible by working simultaneously on both operative windows. In all cases the disc herniation could be completely removed, thus decompressing both nerve roots. Radicular pain was fully relieved without procedure-related morbidity. The intra-extraforaminal exposure was particularly useful in identifying the <b>extraforaminal</b> nerve root early. Early identification was especially advantageous when periradicular scar tissue hid the nerve root from view, {{as it did in}} patients who had undergone previous surgery at the same site or had long-standing radicular symptoms. Controlling the foramen on both sides also reduced the risk of leaving residual disc fragments. A curved probe was used to push the disc material outside the foramen. In conclusion, specific surgical maneuvers made feasible by a simultaneous extraspinal and intraspinal exposure allow quick, safe and complete removal of lumbosacral disc herniations with paramedian and foraminal extension...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Minimally {{invasive}} interventions {{have become}} increasingly popular with the developments in technology and surgical tools. In this article, we present our experience with 67 cases of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy. Material and Method: A total of 67 cases that underwent endoscopic surgery for foraminal and <b>extraforaminal</b> disc hernia between 2004 and 2010 were retrospectively examined. Results: The mean pre-operative VAS score was 8. 13. The mean post-operative VAS score was 2. 4 in the 1 st month and 2. 01 in the 12 th month. Satisfaction according to MacNab criteria in the 12 th month was excellent in 35 (52. 2 %) patients, good in 18 (26. 9 %) patients, fair in 11 (16. 4 %) patients, and poor in 3 (4. 5 %) patients. Microdiscectomy was required due to continuing symptoms in 3 patients (4. 5 %). Temporary dysesthesia was found in 3 patients.

The gritty particles were removed during decompressive surgery and these were proven to be a dystrophic calcification. The patient recovered from weakness and radiating leg pain. Repetitive triamcinolone acetonide injections after discectomy may be the cause of dystrophic calcification not only in the degenerated residual disc, but also in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Possible mechanisms may include the toxicity of preservatives and the insolubility of triamcinolone acetonide.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the anatomy of vertebral arteries using magnetic resonance imaging scans of 250 consecutive patients. OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence of midline vertebral artery (VA) migration in a subgroup of patients presenting with neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy and to identify the course of the VA through the TFs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Knowledge of VA anomalies and their respective prevalence may help surgeons decrease the incidence of iatrogenic injury to this artery. METHODS: In this retrospective review of 281 consecutive patients, who had an magnetic resonance imaging for axial neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy, anatomic measurements were obtained from C 2 to C 7. RESULTS: The observed VA anomalies can be classified into following 3 main groups: (1) intraforaminal anomalies-midline migration, (2) <b>extraforaminal</b> anomalies, and (3) arterial anomalies. Midline migration of the VA was identified in 7. 6 % (19 / 250) of patients. The etiology can be degenerative or traumatic. It is important to note that the pattern of medial migration was clockwise rotation from caudal to cephalad and was present in all of our patients with anomalous arteries. Additionally, at C 6, only 92 % (460 / 500) of VAs were located within their respective transverse foramens and hypoplastic VAs were identified in 10 % (25 / 250) of patients. CONCLUSION: Anomalies that must be considered before surgery include interforamenal anomalies, extraforamenal anomalies, and arterial anomalies. The intraforaminal anomalies involve midline migration, which places the VA at direct risk during corpectomy. <b>Extraforaminal</b> anomalies are related to VAs entering the transverse foramen at a level other than C 6, which can increase the risk of injury during the anterior approach to the cervical spine. Arterial anomalies can be fenestrated, hypoplastic, or absent. These raise concern with the ability to maintain cerebral perfusion in the setting of damage to one of the VAs with the presence of contralateral arterial abnormality...|$|E

The symptoms did not improve after conservative treatment; second stage surgery was performed under a diagnosis of double lesion neuropathy at the lumbar spine and at the piriformis muscle. For release of sciatic nerve compression, incision of the piriformis muscle was performed. The symptoms decreased; however, they persisted. Surgical treatment for the lumbar lesion was performed. The symptoms disappeared immediately after surgical removal of the disc herniation and posterolateral fusion. It {{is important to consider}} double crush syndrome at lumbar lesion and piriformis levels...|$|E
40|$|In laminectomies for costal {{osteochondroma}} causing {{spinal cord}} compression, visualization of the <b>extraforaminal</b> {{part of the}} tumor is limited. The authors describe using a costotransversectomy to resolve spinal cord compression by a costal osteochondroma invading through the neural foramen. A 21 -year-old woman with hereditary multiple exostoses presented with hand numbness and progressive neck and upper back pain. Plain radiographs identified a large lesion of the T 2 and T 3 pedicles, with encroachment on the T 2 - 3 neural foramen causing ~ 50 % spinal canal stenosis. Costotransversectomy was performed to resect the cartilaginous portions of the osteochondroma, debulk the mass, and decompress the spinal canal. A mass of mature bone was left, but no appreciable cartilaginous tumor. At five-year follow- up, the patient had improvement of neck pain, no new neurological deficits. a stable residual mass, and no new osteochondromas, indicating that appropriate surgical management can yield good results and no evidence of recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic disc herniations (TDH) {{requiring}} surgery are rare. They usually {{present with}} pain and/or myelopathy. Only 6 % are wide lateral, either intraforaminal or <b>extraforaminal.</b> A 52 -year-old patient presented with chronic mid-thoracic pain, radiating along the left 9 th and 10 th ribs. After nephrologic and pancreatic diseases had been exclud-ed, a CT-scan showed a far-lateral calcified TDH {{in the left}} Th 9 -Th 10 neuroforamen, compressing the nerve root. Through a paramedian muscle-splitting approach, microscopic drilling of the medial part of the Th 9 -Th 10 facet joint was performed, allowing exposure of the nerve root and removal of a soft her-nia, a mix of degenerative debris and harder calcified aggregates. Postoperatively, the pain disappeared immediately. The authors conclude that intraforaminal TDH may be misleading and mimick pain from abdominal origin. Even if calcified, these lesions may be soft, not adherent and thus easily resectable: this may allow a simpler approach. A microscopic transfacet route offers a minimally invasive approach to the neuro-foramen...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of renal {{carcinoma}} metastasis involving a lumbar nerve root. Metastases to nerve roots are rare occurrences, {{and to our}} knowledge, only six cases have been reported {{so far in the}} literature. The patient in this report presented with weakness in the right lower limb and intractable pain irradiating along the L 5 dermatome. MRI findings revealed a right-sided L 5 nerve root mass, suggestive of a schwannoma, involving the spinal ganglion and its <b>extraforaminal</b> region. Complete macroscopic resection of this mass was performed, and histopathologic analysis confirmed the lesion to be a metastasis of a renal clear cell carcinoma. Local radiotherapy was given and tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered. At 5 months, the patient was pain-free and his right limb weakness had completely resolved. A tumoral recurrence could be observed on the control MRI 5 months after surgery. This report presents the first case of a patient with a renal clear cell carcinoma metastasis to a L 5 nerve root, as well as a brief review of previous cases of metastases to peripheral nerve roots...|$|E
40|$|Bowhunter's syndrome, {{also known}} as {{rotational}} occlusion of the vertebral artery, involves posterior circulation ischemia resulting from dynamic compromise of the dominant vertebral artery. This case {{highlights the importance of}} provocative digital subtraction angiography in making the diagnosis. A 41 -year-old man presented for outpatient neurological evaluation for “lightheadedness” of several years' duration provoked by leftward head rotation. The only abnormality identified on initial magnetic resonance angiography was atresia of the nondominant left vertebral artery. Conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) followed by provocative DSA revealed development of a dynamic stenosis of the right vertebral artery involving the <b>extraforaminal</b> segment just superior to the C 1 vertebra. Noncontrast computed tomography of the cervical spine confirmed ossification of the posterior right atlanto-occipital membrane leading to a near complete bony arcuate foramen. Following neurosurgical decompression, the patient demonstrated complete resolution of all neurologic symptoms. Bowhunter's syndrome is a unique clinical entity that must be considered in the evaluation of patients with symptoms of posterior circulation ischemia. Provocative DSA remains the preferred modality for definitive diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Objective is {{to analyze}} the {{surgical}} strategy, safety, and clinical results of percutaneous full-endoscopic discectomy through interlaminar or <b>extraforaminal</b> puncture technique for LDH. Preoperative CT and MRI were analyzed, which {{were based on the}} main location of the herniated disc and its relationship with compressed nerve root. Sixty-two patients satisfied the inclusion criteria during the period from August 2012 to March 2014. We use percutaneous full-endoscopic discectomy through different puncture technique to remove the protrusive NP for LDH. Sixty patients completed the full-endoscopic operation successfully. Their removed disc tissue volume ranged from 1. 5 [*]mL to 3. 8 [*]mL each time. Postoperative ODI and VAS of low back and sciatica pain were significantly decreased in each time point compared to preoperative ones. No nerve root injury, infection, and other complications occurred. The other two patients were shifted to open surgery. No secondary surgery was required and 91. 6 % of excellent-to-good ratio was achieved on the basis of Macnab criteria at postoperative 12 months. Acquired benefits are fewer complications, rapid recovery, complete NP removal, effective nerve root decompression, and satisfactory cosmetic effect as well. This is a safe, effective, and rational minimally invasive spine-surgical technology with excellent clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Many {{surgical}} {{approaches have}} been defined and {{implemented in the}} last few decades for thoracic disc herniations. The endoscopic foraminal approach in foraminal, lateral, and far lateral disc hernias is a contemporary minimal invasive approach. This study was performed to show that the approach is possible using the microscope without an endoscope, and even the intervention on the discs within the spinal canal is possible by having access through the foramen. Methods. Forty-two cases with disc hernias in the medial of the pedicle were included in this study; surgeries were performed with transforaminal approach and microsurgically. <b>Extraforaminal</b> disc hernias {{were not included in the}} study. Access was made through the Kambin triangle, foramen was enlarged, and spinal canal was entered. Results. The procedure took 65 minutes in the average, and the mean bleeding amount was about 100 cc. They were mobilized within the same day postoperatively. No complications were seen. Follow-up periods range between 5 and 84 months, and the mean follow-up period is 30. 2 months. Conclusion. Transforaminal microdiscectomy is a method that can be performed in any clinic with standard spinal surgery equipment. It does not require additional equipment or high costs...|$|E

40|$|BACKROUND AND PURPOSE: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and clinical utility of a fluoroscopically guided anterolateral oblique approach technique for outpatient diagnostic and therapeutic selective cervical nerve root blockade (SCNRB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a 13 -year period (1994 through February 2007), 4612 patients underwent fluoroscopically guided diagnostic and/or therapeutic <b>extraforaminal</b> SCNRB by using an anterior oblique approach at affiliated outpatient imaging centers. Each procedure was performed by 1 of 6 procedural radiologists, all highly experienced in and actively performing spinal injections on a full-time basis in clinical practice. All of the proceduralists were thoroughly experienced with lumbar injections before endeavoring to perform SCNRBs. Nonionic contrast was injected in nearly all patients (except isolated patients with contrast allergy), and a minimum of 2 projection filming procedures were performed to document the accuracy of needle placement and contrast dispersal before the injection of therapeutic substances. All clinically significant complications beyond skin discoloration and tem-porary exacerbation of symptoms were recorded. RESULTS: There were no serious neurologic complications, such as stroke, spinal cord insult, or permanent nerve root deficit. One life-threatening anaphylactic reaction occurred and was attributed t...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Finite-element {{method was}} used to {{evaluate}} biomechanics stability of <b>extraforaminal</b> lumbar interbody fusion (ELIF) under different internal fixation. Methods. The L 3 –L 5 level finite-element model was established to simulate decompression and internal fixation at L 4 -L 5 segment. The intact finite model was treated in accordance with the different internal fixation. The treatment groups were exerted 400 [*]N load and 6 [*]N·m additional force from motion to calculate the angular displacement of L 4 -L 5. Results. The ROMs were smaller in all internal fixation groups than those in the intact model. Furthermore, the ROMs were smaller in ELIF[*]+[*]UPS group than in TLIF[*]+[*]UPS group under all operating conditions, especially left lateral flexion and right rotation. The ROMs were higher in ELIF[*]+[*]UPS group than in TLIF[*]+[*]BPS group. The ROMs of ELIF[*]+[*]UPS[*]+[*]TLFS group were much smaller than those in ELIF[*]+[*]UPS group, and as compared with TLIF[*]+[*]BPS group, {{there was no significant difference}} in the range of experimental loading. Discussion. The biomechanical stability of ELIF with unilateral pedicle screw fixation is superior to that of TLIF with unilateral pedicle screw fixation but lower than that of TLIF with bilateral pedicle screws fixation. The stability of ELIF with unilateral fixation can be further improved by supplementing a translaminar facet screw...|$|E
