5|$|Formerly {{part of the}} Diocese of Lincoln, {{it served}} what was {{historically}} the largest parish in Buckinghamshire, and the church traditionally had two vicars. Initially the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) was held jointly {{by a pair of}} prominent local families, but {{in the wake of the}} 12th century civil wars of the reign of King Stephen(1135–1154), the advowsons were <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monks of Woburn Abbey and to the Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester, each of whom appointed their own vicars to the parish. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Woburn Abbey, together with its half of the advowson, was <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earls of Bedford, while the half that had belonged to Leicester Abbey passed through a succession of private owners. In 1769 the Duke of Bedford acquired the Leicester half of the advowson and unified the parish, and from then on the parish was served by a single vicar.|$|E

In 1907 the land was <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canadian government, which used it to detain German and Austro-Hungarian nationals during the First World War. During the Second World War, prisoners were sent to McNabs Island instead, and ammunition depots were kept on Melville Island.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E

Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city.

Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
