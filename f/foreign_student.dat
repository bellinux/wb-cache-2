500|$|Phi Tau {{was founded}} at Dartmouth College in 1905 as the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa. While the {{national}} fraternity {{proved to be}} an early leader among its peers in the area of non-discrimination, mid-1950s Tau Chapter leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. The pace of change was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional <b>foreign</b> <b>student</b> members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it had also welcomed Catholics and Jews {{at a time when most}} fraternity members were Protestant. But it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited pledging of Black students between 1952–56, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, Tau broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist. [...] Yet ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused Tau to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members. There has been no reconciliation, even though both groups remain progressive. Today, Phi Tau prides itself on its progressiveness; when the house constitution was rewritten in 1956, references to gender were deliberately excluded, making the house officially coeducational even before Dartmouth College accepted women as students. [...] Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek organization at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them, and was the first Greek house at Dartmouth to add sexual orientation to its non-discrimination clause. [...] Members of Phi Tau refer to one another as [...] "brothers" [...] regardless of gender. The fraternity is known for its quarterly [...] "Milque and Cookies" [...] party, featuring thousands of homemade cookies and milkshakes. [...] Phi Tau completely replaced their residence hall in 2002, at a cost of $1.8 million, funded in part by the sale of [...] of land to the college.|$|E

The purpose of my research was to examine and assess the nature, degree and reasons that <b>foreign</b> <b>students</b> engage in intercultural interactions when on-campus, and determine what my findings indicated towards the greater international student community in New Zealand. One of two methods that I used during my fieldwork consisted of interviewing seven research participants, who I contacted through personal friendships and Massey University clubs and organizations associated with <b>foreign</b> <b>students,</b> about their on-campus intercultural interactions. The second method was a level of participant observation, in which I participated in and observed my research participants during their academic and social university activities to assess their on-campus intercultural interactions. Major findings include the significant role of social and sports organizations in helping <b>foreign</b> <b>students</b> establish intercultural interactions, which are also promoted for many <b>foreign</b> <b>students</b> new to Massey via orientation programs, and the importance of campus accommodation facilitating <b>foreign</b> <b>students</b> intercultural interactions.
