50|$|The Springfield Steam Power Company Block is a {{historic}} <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> at 51-59 Taylor Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. The block was built in 1881 for the Springfield Steam Power Company, which was established by {{the directors of the}} Wason Car Manufacturing Company to provide factory buildings that had steam power facilities for their tenants. The block is a utilitarian three story brick building with some Panel Brick decoration. Its first floor was modified in the 20th century to accommodate retail activities.|$|E

It was built in 1916 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 24, 1983. Here Willys-Overland automobiles were sold {{before and after the}} company became Jeep in the 1960s. Located in the three blocks surrounding the Apremont Triangle Historic District and the famed Hotel Kimball, Willys Overland was among numerous early and mid-twentieth century automobile sellers in the neighborhood.

50|$|The {{vicinity}} of the former station is located near the Forest Hills Volunteer Ambulance Corps. The former <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> west of the line is currently a shopping center. The land east of the line south of Metropolitan Avenue is currently {{the site of the}} Metropolitan Avenue Public School Campus built from 2006 to 2010; the northern entrance to the campus is on Metropolitan Avenue, and the school building sits on the former right-of-way of the northern Montauk connection. The southern wye is used by baseball fields. The overpass above the Montauk branch has been demolished. Shortly after the opening of the Metropolitan campus in 2010, the trestle and overpass over Metropolitan Avenue near the school were deemed to be structurally unsound in a report by the Vornado Realty Trust.|$|E
50|$|In May 2015, {{days before}} Letterman retired, Seth Stevenson {{described}} {{what it was}} like to attend a taping of Late Show:It felt almost regal to enter the Ed Sullivan Theater beneath a lit marquee on 53rd and Broadway instead of through some unmarked, dented metal door on an <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> of Hell's Kitchen. The theater for Late Show with David Letterman seats 450 people instead of 100, and its rococo balcony offers a glorious vista over the sprawling stage where the Beatles first performed in America. Instead of bathing us in washed-out, piped-in music, or a half-hearted pop quintet, Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra rocked us with a wall of sound, including a horn section that blasted riffs clear to the theater rafters...It was hard not to sit in that Late Show studio audience and feel—for the first time—indispensable. Letterman puts on a show. He presents fully-rounded entertainment, and he feeds off the energy in the room. This is a big, brassy venue with a live orchestra, instead of a cramped black-box studio with somebody's iPod plugged into ceiling speakers. And Letterman needed us there.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} types of swage block: Industrial, as {{described}} above, & Artistic. Artist Blacksmiths sometimes require {{a tool that}} will allow metal to be formed in ways that an anvil or traditional <b>industrial</b> swage <b>block</b> will not allow, a special Artists' block is then often used. As with <b>industrial</b> swage <b>blocks,</b> artistic blocks come in many shapes and sizes; common features are hemispherical and ovoid depressions, asymmetrical curves and non-standard angled planes (i.e. not 45 or 90 degrees). In addition, individual blocks may contain unique features of specific use or relevance to a particular smith or branch of the blacksmithing craft.|$|R

40|$|After ten years, the Mercosur {{seems to}} be the most {{successful}} integration process in Latin America. However, its development remains imperfect due to asymmetric situations between the countries. Brazil is the regional <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> and the integration process would lead his partners to become captive markets and to see their domestic industrial production decrease. In order to analyze the possibility of such scenario, we adopt a New Economic Geography modelwith three regions and asymmetries. Its serves as a support to numerical simulations of trade liberalization in Mercosur. We show a redeployment of industrial activities from Brazil to Argentina, witch has the best differential of productivity, and may appear to be the new regional <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> in the end of integration process. An empirical verification is donewith a Grubel-Lloyd indicator upon trade flows within Mercosur. It confirms largely theconclusions of the theoretical model. (Full text in French) ...|$|E

It is dem onstrated that supply disturbances originating in the raw-materials m arket lead to positive across economic zones and persistent over time comovements in trade, investment, and output if the world real inter est rate moves countercyclically. It is also shown that the sign of t he response of the current account to a supply shock depends on the s ize of the distribution of gains from trade. ...|$|E
40|$|Interstitial iron (Fei) and iron-boron pairs {{influence}} or even limit the recombination lifetime in <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> cast multicrystalline (mc) silicon, though the proportions {{in the total}} iron concentration are generally small. Most of the iron in mc silicon is precipitated and less recombination active. This work aims for {{a better understanding of}} the distribution of iron in its different states (precipitated or dissolved) over the block height, as well as in regions of different crystal quality. In experimental studies several features of iron in mc silicon were observed, which occur due to the high extended defect density. In our 2 -dimensional model for mc silicon, trapping of interstitial Fe at extended defects and precipitation at the extended defects are taken into account. The results are compared with NAA-data and spatial resolved measurements of the Fei concentration...|$|E
40|$|Test model {{generation}} {{is crucial in}} the test generation process of a high-performance design targeted for large volume production. A key process in test model generation requires the extraction of a gate-level (logic) model from the transistor level representation of the circuit under test. Logic extraction is an error prone process due to extraction tool limitations and due to the human interference. Errors introduced by extraction require manual debugging, a resource intensive and time consuming task. This paper presents a set of extraction errors typical in an industrial environment. It also proposes an automated solution to extraction error diagnosis and correction. Experiments on circuits with similar architecture to that of high speed custom-made <b>industrial</b> <b>blocks</b> are conducted to confirm the fitness of the approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings' Infinity Initiative {{program is}} the carpet industry's first {{commercial}} operation {{to address the problem}} of solid waste disposal. In this program, Collins & Aikman assists customers with the coordination and return of their carpet for recycling. During 1995, 3. 75 million pounds of extrudable material was diverted from land filling. In the Infinity Initiative program, reclaimed commercial carpet and manufacturing waste are reduced in size by a grinding process. The ground, thermoplastic material is then extruded into other useful products. These products can be recycled again and again, thus creating products with an infinite life cycle. The program was named "Infinity Initiative" because products will essentially have an infinite life cycle. Extensive market research was conducted to ensure that products produced from recycling through the Infinity Initiative program would have real market value. Products currently produced from recycled composite material (ER³) include: car parking stops, <b>industrial</b> <b>block</b> flooring, and highway sound barrier walls. A program is currently in place to use this source of recycled material in Collins & Aikman products - that is to recycle our product back into itself. The company's goal is to offer a product with high recycle content before late 1996. Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings is one of industry's largest suppliers of specialty commercial flooring. Their plants, located in Dalton, Georgia, manufacture modular carpet tile with a conventional, vinyl "hard back" as well as six-foot wide roll goods with a vinyl "cushion" back. Collins & Aikman Powerbond RS products are constructed differently than many "conventional" caipets. Powerbond products, engineered for maximum performance, are composed of a densely constructed, premium nylon 6. 6 face and a vinyl composite backing. A microencapsulated tackifier (RS) system applied to the product during manufacturing eliminates the use of "wet" adhesives during installation...|$|E
