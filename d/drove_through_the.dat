5|$|Austria's Alexander Wurz <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{field in}} his Williams from 19th {{at the start}} to finish third by taking one pitstop, {{completing}} 40 laps on super soft tires. By finishing third Wurz, recorded his third career podium, in the race that marked ten years since his debut race in F1. Nick Heidfeld finished in second place after trailing Hamilton {{for the majority of}} the race. The safety car deployments also allowed Heikki Kovalainen to move up to fourth after starting at the back of the grid. The race was the first time in the 2007 season where a driver from a team other than Ferrari or McLaren made the podium.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Huskisson was {{appointed}} to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy. In the same year he succeeded George Canning in the important constituency of Liverpool. He oversaw a number of reforms aimed at developing industry and free trade, including reform of the Navigation Acts and reduction of taxes on manufacturing and on the import of foreign goods. He <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> restructuring of Britain's network of overseas outposts and colonies into the network of economically and politically interdependent states which became the British Empire, aiming for a gradual abolition of slavery and accelerating British colonisation.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} 27 stockmen from Wellshot moved the biggest ever single mob of sheep when {{a flock of}} 43,000 were <b>droved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area in 1886.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is named}} after a large granite rock, Latham Rock, that is located close to the townsite. The rock was named after an early {{pastoralist}} in the region who established a watering place for stock being <b>droved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
5|$|Løvold was {{an active}} member of Foreningen Kristiansunderen, an {{organization}} which worked for the betterment of the town. After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue fountain in Kristiansund. The mermaid statue was never built, although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain. Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota, which he had not seen in 42 years. He also visited New York City, where he <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Holland Tunnel. On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool {{team were}} welcomed {{back to the}} city by {{approximately}} half a million people, as the open-top bus <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city to the town hall. Three days after the final, Liverpool faced Italian team Internazionale in the first leg of the semi-finals of the 1964–65 European Cup. Before the match kicked off, Bryne and Gordon Milne paraded the FA Cup around the stadium. Liverpool won the match 3–1, but they did not perform as well in the second leg at the San Siro, as they lost 3–0 to exit the competition 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed, the other two were engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E

5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donbass, drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow. The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. They <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> German positions, making broad and deep penetrations. By 5 August, the Soviets had liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|Kasey Kahne {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by Carl Edwards, who started second. On the following two laps, Jimmie Johnson took over the fourth position. On the fourth lap, Edwards passed Kahne for the first position. After starting from 37th, Denny Hamlin had moved to 27th by lap six. Eleventh-placed qualifier Jeff Gordon joined team-mate Johnson in the top ten four laps later. Johnson passed A. J. Allmendinger on lap 12 to claim the third position, as David Reutimann and Kurt Busch collided into the wall. Five laps later, the first caution was given after Reutimann collided into the wall again. Most of the front runners made pit stops, except for J. J. Yeley, who didn't pit until the following lap. At the lap 22 restart, Edwards was first, ahead of Kahne, Allmendinger, and Johnson. Hamlin turned sideways and <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grass in the infield, prompting the second caution on the following lap. Hamlin only sustained minor damage to his splitter. Edwards remained the leader during the restart, while Allmendinger took over second from Kahne.|$|E
5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson {{to feel more}} at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E

5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Just past 6:00am on June 4, as {{a convoy}} of {{students}} who had vacated the Square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the Square, firing tear gas and one <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowd, killing 11 students, injuring scores.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of Michael Brown's death, mourners decided to hold a protest by {{blocking}} a road way. A vehicle later <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> protesters hitting one and knocking them into the air. Protesters then began to shoot at the fleeing vehicle. The injured protester was later brought to a hospital and the driver cooperated with police.|$|E

25|$|Owens co-hosted a {{radio show}} called Buck and Britt in 1945. In the late 1940s he became a truck driver and <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> San Joaquin Valley of California. He was {{impressed}} by Bakersfield, {{where he and his}} wife settled in 1951. Soon, Owens was frequently traveling to Hollywood for session recording jobs at Capitol Records, playing backup for Tennessee Ernie Ford, Wanda Jackson, Tommy Collins, Tommy Duncan, and many others.|$|E
25|$|In Bahrain, Räikkönen {{suffered}} electronic {{problems during}} Friday practice and a spectacular rear suspension breakage {{during the first}} qualifying session, which forced him back to 22nd place on the grid. Nevertheless he <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> field, ending third behind Alonso and Michael Schumacher. In Malaysia, Räikkönen was hit from behind by Red Bull Racing's Christian Klien on the first lap. The impact caused a left rear suspension failure resulting in Räikkönen retiring from the race.|$|E
25|$|The {{features}} that became Niagara Falls {{were created by}} the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a continental ice sheet that <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris. Scientists argue {{there is an old}} valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.|$|E

The last was part-time Private William Megrath of 11 UDR who was shot dead in July 1987 as he <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Twinbrook area of west Belfast {{on his way home from}} his civilian job.|$|E
25|$|On the 21st Army Group's left, one {{corps of}} the Canadian 1st Army reached the North Sea near the Dutch-German border on 16 April, while another <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> central Netherlands, {{trapping}} the German forces remaining in that country. However, {{concerned that the}} bypassed Germans would flood {{much of the nation}} and cause complete famine among a Dutch population already near starvation, General Eisenhower approved an agreement with the local enemy commanders to allow the Allies to air-drop food into the country in return for a local ceasefire on the battlefield. The ensuing airdrops, which began on 29 April, marked the beginning of what was to become a colossal effort to put war-torn Europe back together again.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{building}} became a royal residence, the hall received noted visitors, including three Governors General of the Province of Canada: the Lord Sydenham, the Earl of Elgin, and Sir Edmund Head. It {{was said that}} the watercolours of Barrack Hill (now Parliament Hill) painted by the latter governor's wife, Lady Head, while she was visiting Rideau Hall, had influenced Queen Victoria to choose Bytown (now Ottawa) as the national capital. Also, on 2 September 1860, {{the day after he}} laid the cornerstone of the parliament buildings, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), <b>drove</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grounds of Rideau Hall as part of his tour of the region.|$|E
