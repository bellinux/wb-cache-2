2500|$|Toot is {{the same}} cousin who tried to steer T.I. toward {{positivity}} and is most notably shouted out on [...] "Rubber Band Man". Jay-Ru was a buddy T.I. used to hustle with. The two had a falling out and Jay-Ru died before the two {{had a chance to}} reconcile. [...] "Me and Jay-Ru was still close partners," [...] T.I. explained. [...] "We lived together, we was in the streets hustling together. I had got involved with my older son's mom at the time. I moved out of the apartment into my own spot with her. Me and Jay-Ru fell out about that it took a toll on me. To this day I still think about him, especially when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> daughter",T.I. stated. According to T. I. himself, [...] securing Jamie Foxx on piano wasn't too tough of a task. [...] "I sent the word I wanted him to get on it and he got on it the next day. [...] I was thinking about everybody who could play the piano as well as sing, and Jamie {{was at the top of}} my list". [...] T. I. added that he was just about done with his album, but he's not ruling out a last-minute guest appearance by Jay-Z, who was supposed to get on a record called [...] "Good Life", [...] but due to scheduling conflicts he didn't make it and Common took his place. The two hooked up while both were in Los Angeles for the Grammys. T.I. would also have recording sessions for the album with record Producers Just Blaze, Keith Mack, Travis Barker, The Neptunes, Kevin [...] "Khao" [...] Cates, Nick [...] "Fury" [...] Loftin and Tony Galvin.|$|E

6000|$|... "Wal, tell me or not, jest as you like. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> tracks--follered them. An' Wade, old pard, I've {{reckoned}} {{long ago}} thar's a nigger in the wood-pile." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice {{something}} seemed to come back to the face of the older man. He rose slowly to <b>his</b> feet. <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> white fingers trembling, but <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> eyes suddenly fill with a new and stronger light.|$|R
60|$|SLOAN (soberly). <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> (<b>His</b> eyes {{fall on the}} pianola in surprise.) Ah--a piano.|$|E
6000|$|... 3 [...] I see a {{beautiful}} gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies [...] of the sea, [...] His brown hair lies close {{and even to}} his head, he strikes out with [...] courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, [...] <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> white body, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> undaunted eyes, [...] I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on [...] the rocks.|$|E

60|$|And {{sure enough}} out he popped {{from the back}} room at that very instant. Katie looked at him, {{and he looked at}} Katie, and <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> face get kind of hard; but he didn't say a word. And {{presently}} he went out again.|$|R
60|$|In {{the rays}} of the lantern <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> perplexed face peering down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I {{can find}} him. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> him when <b>I</b> first came in, but <b>I</b> can't <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face because he's {{hiding behind the}} prosecuting attorney." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Describe {{him to me}} once more," [...] {{she said}} eagerly. [...] "For the last time, before <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> <b>His</b> eyes, his hair, his complexion--everything!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{dying for}} a little encouragement. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face now, and his earnest absorbed look while I talked. I never saw an ugly man look so handsome." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leaning over a ledge of rock, and peering keenly {{down into}} a clear pool which was {{sheltered}} from the surf, Dan suddenly exclaimed, [...] "There's one, Matt; <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> feelers." ...|$|E

60|$|Never had <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> {{beautiful}} eyes so brightly soft, so irresistibly tender, as {{they appeared}} now. He {{held out his hand}} to me. It is one of my small merits to be (in the popular phrase) as good as my word. I took his hand; well knowing that the action committed me to accepting his friendship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Particularly gentlemanlike," [...] said Mr. Rivers. [...] "Very clever--the {{head of the}} school, as {{his father}} tells me--and so modest and unassuming--though <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> father is very proud of him." ...|$|E
60|$|Even after {{knowing that}} the deserter was near at hand, we had {{considerable}} difficulty in locating him, and not until after making a complete circle around the swimmer could <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
6000|$|Kit laughed. [...] "Miss Brown meant well, {{you mean}} well, but you don't understand. Wolf is {{cheating}} the French captain. He'd an object for {{asking him to}} the feast. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> plan." ...|$|E
60|$|If she {{had been}} a man Ray would have struck her. <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> white teeth clenched {{fiercely}} together.|$|R

6000|$|... "Charity--and poverty--and {{some not}} very congenial 'job,' {{as you call}} it, to put bread in your mouth. No, no, I {{would not like to}} trust myself to your Providence, or to your Chance. Though I admit your Chance is a sounder {{proposition}} than Lilly's Providence. You speculate with your life and your talent. I admit the nature which is a born speculator. After all, with your flute, you will speculate in other people's taste for luxury, as a man may speculate in theatres or trains de luxe. You are the speculator. That may be your way of wisdom. But Lilly does not even speculate. <b>I</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>his</b> point. <b>I</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>his</b> point. <b>I</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>his</b> point.

60|$|For a space he is silent, {{and we go}} {{on through}} the trees. A Utopian tram-car passes and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, poor bitted wretch! looking pinched and scared in its {{trailing}} glow of light.|$|E
6000|$|L. Ha.—Look ye, I {{knew you}} could not say it and forbear {{laughing}} [...] [looking over Charlotte].—Oh! <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> name as plain as you [...] do—F—r—a—n Fran,—c—i—s, cis, Francis, ’tis in every line of the [...] book.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> {{monument}} there,' shouted Stephen. 'But {{there is}} no connection between his family and mine: there cannot be.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> upturned {{face as he}} floated onwards {{down the}} stream, through the meadow! It was full of deep resignation.|$|R
60|$|In county {{elections}} you {{had better}} stand by Governor Johnson's plan; otherwise you will have conflict and confusion. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> plan.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} dead man walked no more Amongst the Trial Men, And I {{knew that he was}} {{standing}} up In the black dock's dreadful pen, And that never would <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face In God's sweet world again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, in truth, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> yellow hair. And the other, {{him with}} the beard, it is Lockwood of Skipton. Alas for his wife who keeps the booth by the bridge-head of Ribble! I wot not who the third may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bundercombe, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face change. His mouth came wide open; {{his eyes}} {{looked as though}} they would drop out. He bend over that note. He {{looked at it and}} looked at it; and then he looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> wife, <b>I</b> sh'd caution {{her about}} lettin' him climb {{mountains}} too much. A'n't your father afraid he'll ovado?" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>his</b> dilemma. It was {{the best}} man who should go, and yet it {{was the best}} man whom he could least spare.|$|R
