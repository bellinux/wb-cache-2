5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sync with the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play {{on the subject of}} Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E

The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E

5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> phase with another.|$|E

5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the loop}} <b>is</b> {{a form of}} partial ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether the feeling of failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop can be eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to enjoy being a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, the raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E
