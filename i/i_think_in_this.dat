60|$|Thus much I {{could not}} refrain from saying, not that I think John Bull is very often {{right in his}} controversies with ourselves, but because <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, he is; and because I believe it far safer, in the long run, for a nation, or an individual, to have justice on his side, than always to carry his point.|$|E

60|$|An {{intelligent}} foreigner's {{testimony about}} our manners is always worth having, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect {{the work of}} an eminent American, Mr. N. P. Willis is eminently valuable and impartial. In his 'History of Ernest Clay,' a crack magazine-writer, the reader will get an exact account of the life of a popular man of letters in England. He is always the lion of society.|$|E

[...] "Although not very friendly, they would nevertheless help us, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hour of need. They have been demoralised by traders, and drawn away from the mission at Godhaab. But how we are to get to the mainland it is difficult to see, unless God mercifully clears away the ice." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the midst}} of my eighteenth year fortune began to darken. My mother had told me little of the world, its chances and changes, cares and troubles. What I had learned of these came chiefly from books and my own speculations. We had few {{visitors}} and from {{all but the most}} familiar I was quickly packed away. My mother was sensitive of me, for both our sakes. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> she was mistaken, for when my time came, Life found me raw, and it rubbed in the salt rather vigorously.|$|E

In {{theatrical}} circles each principal performer is furnished {{with what is}} termed in the profession an under-study. This is an actor, male or female, {{as the case may}} be, who studies the part of the performer, and is capable of going through with it, with more or less ability, in case the regular actor, from sickness or any other cause, is prevented from appearing in his part. In this way the manager provides against emergencies which might at any time stop his play and ruin his business. Now, I should like very much to be your under-study, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> capacity I could be of great service to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bradley {{hesitated a}} little. [...] "No, we can't do that, {{but we can}} destroy any special {{privilege}} they hold. But {{the first thing that}} stares us in the face is the war tariff that is eating us up. I'm going to state just what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign, and you can vote for me or not. It is sheer robbery to continue a tariff that was laid {{at a time when we}} needed enormous revenue. See the surplus piling up in the public vault. You say it's better to have a surplus than a deficit. Yes, but I'd rather have the surplus in the pockets of the people. This taxing the people to death, in order to have a surplus to expend in senseless appropriations, is poor policy." ...|$|E

Anything {{might happen}} either before or after; but still, with your leave, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case we {{may as well}} certify first; {{you might want to}} be getting away, and it will save so much trouble later.

You do not resemble my countrymen in that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Freud and Bacon {{appeared}} {{as two of}} the Eight Portraits, an unpublished manuscript of photos and writings which was discovered after Deakin's death. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> work, Deakin wrote of Bacon: [...] "He's an odd one, wonderfully tender and generous by nature, yet with curious streaks of cruelty, especially to friends. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> portrait <b>I</b> managed to catch something of the fear which must underlie these contradictions in his character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{a matter}} of fact, Mrs Lovat, there are seven. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case Mrs Lawford intends to suggest not so much that--that her husband is in that condition; {{habitual}} sin, you know--grave enough, of course, I own--but that he is actually being compelled, even {{to the extent of}} a more or less complete change of physiognomy, to follow the biddings of some atrocious spiritual influence. It is no breach of confidence to say that I have myself been present at a death-bed where the struggle against what I may call the end was perfectly awful to witness. I don't profess to follow all the ramifications of the affair, but though possibly Mr Danton may seem a little harsh, such harshness, if I may venture to intercede, is not necessarily [...] "vindictive." [...] And--and personal security is a consideration.' ...|$|E
60|$|In a glass case, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> room, was {{exhibited}} the suit of clothes he last wore; a blue coat with large metal buttons, plaid trousers, and broad-brimmed hat. Around {{the sides of}} this room there was a gallery of light tracery work; {{a flight of stairs}} led up to it, and in one corner of it was a door which the woman said led to the poet's bed room. One seemed to see in all this arrangement how snug, and cozy, and comfortable the poet had thus ensconced himself, to give himself up to his beloved labors and his poetic dreams. But there was a cold and desolate air of order and adjustment about it which reminds one of the precise and chilling arrangements of a room from which has just been carried out a corpse; all is silent and deserted.|$|E
6000|$|... 23. Now, at last, I see {{my way to}} useful {{summary of}} the whole, which I had better give in a {{separate}} chapter: and will try in future to do the preliminary work of elaboration of the sap from my authorities, above shown, in its process, to the reader, without making so much fuss about it. But, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, it was desirable that the floods of pros-, par-, peri-, dia-, and circumlocution, through which one has to wade towards any emergent crag of fact in modern scientific books, should for once {{be seen in the}} wasteful tide of them; that so I might finally pray the younger students who feel, or remember, their disastrous sway, to cure themselves for ever of the fatal habit of imagining that they know more of anything after naming it unintelligibly, and thinking about it impudently, than they did by loving sight of its nameless being, and in wise confession of its boundless mystery.|$|E
5000|$|Yves Winkin, a Belgian {{professor}} of communications, {{responded to a}} popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper Le Soir that [...] "There is no transcendent truth. ... It {{is not surprising that}} these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does." ...|$|R

60|$|ATTEN. Well, Sir, as {{you have}} intimated, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we have, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> place, spoken enough about these kind of men; if you please, let us return again to Mr. Badman himself, {{if you have any}} more to say of him.|$|R
60|$|But {{this notion}} of a sneer is not admissible. Dickens was far too frank and generous a writer to employ such an {{elaborate}} plot of silence. His satire was always intended to attack, never to entrap; moreover, he was far too vain a man not to wish the crowd to see all his jokes. Vanity is more divine than pride, {{because it is more}} democratic than pride. Third, and most important, Dickens was a good Liberal, and would have been horrified at the notion of making so venomous a vendetta against one race or creed. Nevertheless the fact is there, as I say, if only as a curiosity of literature. I defy any man to read through Our Mutual Friend after hearing this suggestion, and to get out of his head the conviction that Lammle is the wrong kind of Jew. The explanation lies, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> that Dickens was so wonderfully sensitive to that change that has come over our society, that he noticed the type of the oriental and cosmopolitan financier without even knowing that it was oriental or cosmopolitan. He had, in fact, fallen a victim to a very simple fallacy affecting this problem. Somebody said, with great wit and truth, that treason cannot prosper, because when it prospers it cannot be called treason. The same argument soothed all possible Anti-Semitism in men like Dickens. Jews cannot be sneaks and snobs, because when they are sneaks and snobs they do not admit that they are Jews.|$|E
60|$|Certainly a Stoic {{would have}} smiled {{to see me}} at dinner. There sat my royal majesty, and {{absolute}} prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a king eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had done. Poll, {{as if he had}} been my principal court favorite, was the only person, permitted to talk with me. My old but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour. These were not the cats I had brought from the ship; they had been dead long before, and interred near my habitation by mine own hand. But one of them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their young I had made tame; the rest ran wild into the woods, and in time grew so impudent as to return and plunder me of my stores, till such time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me without troubling me any more. In this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my boat; I knew not which way to get her round the island. One time I resolved to go along the shore by land to her; but had any one in England met such a figure, it would either have affrighted them, or made them burst into laughter; nay, I could not but smile myself at my habit, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> place will be very proper to describe.|$|E
6000|$|The {{principal}} {{objection to}} Proctor's {{theory is that}} there seems no adequate reason why Jasper should not have murdered his nephew if he wanted to. And there seems even less reason why Drood, if unsuccessfully murdered, should not have raised the alarm. Happy young architects, when nearly strangled by elderly organists, do not generally stroll away and come back some time afterwards in a wig and with a false name. Superficially it would seem almost as odd to find the murderer investigating {{the origin of the}} murder, as to find the corpse investigating it. To this problem two of the ablest literary critics of our time, Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. William Archer (both of them persuaded generally of the Proctor theory) have especially addressed themselves. Both have come to the same substantial conclusion; and I suspect that they are right. They hold that Jasper (whose mania for opium is much insisted on in the tale) had some sort of fit, or trance, or other physical seizure as he was committing the crime so that he left it unfinished; and they also hold that he had drugged Drood, so that Drood, when he recovered from the attack, was doubtful about who had been his assailant. This might really explain, if a little fancifully, his coming back to the town in the character of a detective. He might think it due to his uncle (whom he last remembered in a kind of murderous vision) to make an independent investigation as to whether he was really guilty or not. He might say, as Hamlet said of a vision equally terrifying, [...] "I'll have grounds more relative than this." [...] In fairness it must be said that there is something vaguely shaky about this theory; chiefly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect; that there is a sort of farcical cheerfulness about Datchery which does not seem altogether appropriate to a lad who ought to be in an agony of doubt as to whether his best friend was or was not his assassin. Still there are many such incongruities in Dickens; and the explanation of Mr. Archer and Mr. Lang is an explanation. I do not believe that any explanation as good can be given to account for the tale being called The Mystery of Edwin Drood, if the tale practically starts with his corpse.|$|E

60|$|It is not common, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country, {{to publish}} on the half- profits system, {{but it is}} very common in England, where, owing {{probably}} to the moisture in the air, which lends a fairy outline to every prospect, it seems to be peculiarly alluring. One of my own early books was published there on these terms, which I accepted with the insensate joy of the young author in getting any terms from a publisher. The book sold, sold every copy of the small first edition, and in due time the publisher's statement came. I did not think my half of the profits was very great, but it seemed a fair division after every imaginable cost had been charged up against my poor book, and that frail venture had been made to pay the expenses of composition, corrections, paper, printing, binding, advertising, and editorial copies. The wonder ought to have been that there was anything at all coming to me, but I was young and greedy then, and I really thought there ought to have been more. I was disappointed, but I made the best of it, of course, and took the account to the junior partner of the house which employed me, and said that I should like to draw on him for the sum due me from the London publishers. He said, Certainly; but after a glance at the account he smiled and said he supposed I knew how much the sum was? I answered, Yes; it was eleven pounds nine shillings, was not it? But I owned {{at the same time that}} I never was good at figures, and that I found English money peculiarly baffling. He laughed now, and said, It was eleven shillings and ninepence. In fact, after all those charges for composition, corrections, paper, printing, binding, advertising, and editorial copies, there was a most ingenious and wholly surprising charge of ten per cent. commission on sales, which reduced my half from pounds to shillings, and handsomely increased the publisher's half in proportion. I do not now dispute the justice of the charge. It was not the fault of the half- profits system; it was the fault of the glad young author who did not distinctly inform himself of its mysterious nature in agreeing to it, and had only to reproach himself if he was finally disappointed.|$|E

30|$|I {{would like}} to {{conclude}} calming the spirit of multiculturalists. They {{have no reason to}} be offended. I have argued that MC has many reasons to move from an initial idealist period to a much more pragmatic one, limiting its claim for inclusion under the auspices of equal justice. This MC pragmatic period (post-MC period) also means that the MC policy paradigm must abandon its hegemonic attitude and learn to share diversity-friendly narratives with other emerging distinctive policy paradigms: IC. <b>In</b> fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> MC legitimacy crisis I have drawn, IC can play the role of giving MC new breath.|$|R
