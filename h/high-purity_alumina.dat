40|$|Nanoscopic {{aluminium}} fluoride and magnesium fluoride were investigated as sintering additives for <b>high-purity</b> <b>alumina</b> ceramic production. Nanoscopic magnesium fluoride {{has been found}} to be an excellent sintering additive.

These complexions included a thick crystallized film that was likely amorphous at high temperatures, a thin intergranular film, multilayer adsorption, and a type of boundary that showed no observable film by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|Work in the {{development}} of fluid-bed fluoride volatility processes is described. In these processes, uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuels are converted into hexafluoride compounds in a fluid-bed reactor. The uranium and plutonium hexafluorides are volatile and can be separated from fission products, cladding, and alloying materials by techniques such as vaporization and distillation. The experimental work was directed toward devising a fluorination procedure for uranium and plutonium dioxides which would result in a high degree of removal of uranium and plutonium as hexafluorides. In these experiments synthetic mixtures made up to simulate a charge for a fluidized bed reactor (100 kg U, 0. 4 kg Pu, approximates 1 kg F. P., and 30 kg inert solids) were used. <b>High-purity</b> recrystallized <b>alumina</b> was found to be a suitable material for use as the fluidized inert solid. After a 10 -hr fluorination period at 450 deg C, the concentrations of residual uranium and plutonium on the alumina were 0. 01 and 0. 03 wt%, respectively. A reaction temperature of 450 deg C was found to be optimum, since experiments at 500 and 550 deg C resulted in plutonium retentions on the alumina of 0. 060 and 0. 090 wt%, respectively. At all these temperatures, the residual uranium content of the residue was less than 0. 01 wt%. When fission product element oxides, in quantities that would be expected in a Dresden-type fuel after 100, 000 Mwd/ton burnup and 30 days of cooling, were added to the uranium dioxide-plutonium dioxide [...] alumina and the mixture was fluorinated at 450 deg C for 10 hr, the concentration of plutonium on the alumina increased to a value of 0. 065 U%. Additional recovery of the plutonium retained on the alumina was obtained by either pyrohydrolysis followed by refluorination at 450 deg C for 10 hr, or by refluorination alone at 550 deg C for 10 hr. These procedures reduced the residual plutonium content of the alumina to less than 0. 02 wt%. Experiments were also performed to determine the feasibility of using the same batch of alumina as the inert solid for the fluorinations of five batches of the urania [...] plutonia solid solution. Experiments were performed in which the solid solution of plutonium dioxide in uranium dioxide was oxidized prior to fluorination. The oxidation resulted in a powdered mixture of uranosic oxide and plutonium dioxide. Fluorination of this oxide mixture in alumina resulted in the removal of essentially all of the uranium in a reaction time of 2 hr at 450 deg C when 10 vol% fluorine was used. When this fluorination was followed by a second fluorination period of 5 hr at 550 deg C with 75 vol% fluorine, the plutonium content of the alumina was 0. 011 wt%. When both fluorination periods were extended to 10 hr each, the retention of plutonium was 0. 007 wt%, which corresponded to a removal of 99. 5 % of the plutonium contained in the solid mixture. During {{the first part of the}} fluorination period, in which the major portion of the uranium is removed from the mixture of uranium dioxide, plutonium dioxide, alumina, and representative fission product element oxides, a low ternperature (450 deg C) and a low concentration of fluorine (10 vol% fluorine in nitrogen) are desirable. However, in order to remove the plutonium efficiently during the last portion of the fluorination period, it is desirable to use a higher temperature (550 deg C) and a higher fluorine content of the gas mixture (75 vol% fluorine in nitrogen).

However, most ceramics are almost transparent to microwaves at room temperatures and frequencies reserved for industrial usage.

40|$|A rather broad {{investigation}} was carried {{on in the}} materials and methods which are considered possibly useful in forming ceramic to metal seals and composite structures {{for use in the}} environment of cesium-plasma thermionic converters. Initially, studies of five specific meands of joining refractory metals to alumina were undertaken, as well as studies of metallizing methods, of forming graded tungsten-alumina composites, and of the possible metals and ceramics which could be utilized best in structures operated at 2000 deg C. The five joining methods studied are: (1) Formation of a continuous electroplated layer of refractory metal across the adjacent surfaces of metal and ceramic. (2) Welding of a metal member to the ceramic by ultrasonic welding techniques; i. e., without heat. (3) Use of high temperature brazing alloys. (4) Formation of a bond between metal and ceramic by the diffusion of compatible intermediate materials into both structural members. (5) Welding of single oxide ceramics directly to refractory metals using electron-beam welding equipment. The study of metallizing methods was started because the first three of the joining methods listed require the use of a metallized surface of the alumina. It was determined that three of the five methods for joining refractory metals to alumina which were under study were not practically fessible. The methods considered impractical are: formation of a continuous electroplated joint, welding by ultrasonic energy, and welding with electron beam techniques. The studies on these methods were ended. Significant achievements {{have been made in the}} other studies. A metallizing process has been developed by which a strongly adherent sintered tungsten film can be applied to commercially available, high-purity, silica-free alumina. No fluxing materials or active metals which are susceptible to attack by cesium are used in this process. Bonding of alumina to molybdenum has been successful by several methods developed from the diffusion seal study. Some of these have been tested at 1500 deg C successfully, i. e., with neither structural failure nor loss of hermeticity resulting from the test. Methods of fabricating graded-composition, tungsten-alumina emitter and envelope stractures have been developed. Techniques for making brazed joints between refractory metals and <b>high-purity</b> <b>alumina</b> metallized with tungsten, using high temperature brazing alloys, are considered to be well enough developed for use of these structures near 1500 deg C. Diffusion joining methods for molybdenum or niobium and alumina are also considered to be processes which are immediately applicable to joining molybdenum or niobium and commercially available <b>high-purity</b> <b>alumina</b> for use at this temperature. Tungsten, rheniuan, hafnia, thoria, and yttria have been identified as the most promising materials for 2000 deg C service. The techniques developed for fabrication of tungsten-alumina composite bodies are considered to be directly applicable to formation of composite structures utilizing combinations of the materials for 2000 deg C service. Diffusion bonding of tungsten or rhenium to hafnia, thoria, or yttria demonstrates a high potential capability as a means of joining these materials for use at 2000 deg C. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Fine-grained and {{coarse-grained}} aluminas containing either equiaxed or elongated grain {{structures were}} fabricated from commercial-purity and <b>high-purity</b> <b>alumina</b> powders. Compared to the high-purity aluminas, the commercial-purity aluminas having a coarse grain size and elongated grain structures exhibited significantly more pronounced flaw tolerance and T-curve behavior. T-curve behavior determined from indentation strength tests suggested {{that only the}} coarse- grained, elongated-grain alumina had a T-curve sufficient to cause stable crack extension prior to failure, a requirement for any observable improvement in reliability. In the high-purity aluminas {{as well as the}} fine-grained commercial-purity aluminas, however, it is likely that little or no stable extension occurs prior failure, suggesting that strength in these materials is dependent on the critical flaw size. Strength tests on polished specimens showed the commercial-purity aluminas had a lower means strength than the high- purity aluminas and the coarse-grained aluminas exhibited a lower mean strength compared to the fine-grained aluminas. An analysis of the mean strength versus grain size revealed that the differences in critical flaw size alone could not account for the differences in mean strength. Instead, a combination of changes in flaw size as well as T-curve behavior were shown to be responsible for the differences in strength and flaw tolerance. T-curve behavior was also found to have a profound influence on the strength variability of alumina. For example, the Weibull modulus for the coarse-grained, commercial- purity alumina was almost twice that of the fine-grained, high-purity material. Tests with indented specimens conclusively demonstrated that improvements in reliability in these materials are not due solely to changes in the critical flaw size distribution but rather a combination of flaw size distribution and T-curve behavior...|$|E
40|$|Isoelectric {{trapping}} (IET), {{has proven}} {{to be one of the}} most successful electrophoretic techniques used for separations of ampholytic compounds. IET is carried out in multicompartment electrolyzers (MCEs) in which adjacent compartments are joined through buffering membranes whose pH values bracket the pI of the ampholytic component to be trapped in the compartment. The present small-scale instruments use plastics as their structural materials, which causes poor Joule heat dissipation. The separation compartments have cylindrical or pear-shaped interiors with large internal diameters, which create long heat transfer paths. The long electrode distances yield low field strengths that lead to low electrophoretic velocities for the analytes. These factors interrelatedly limit the electric power that can be applied to the system, contributing to long separation times. Furthermore, these devices do not offer a realistic solution to the problems associated with the detection of low abundance proteins. To address these problems, two novel IET devices have been developed for small-scale IET separations. The first device, named MSWIFT, was constructed using thermally conductive, <b>high-purity</b> <b>alumina</b> as the structural material of the separation compartments. By creating narrow, 0. 1 - or 0. 2 -mL channels in thin alumina blocks, the heat transfer path from the center of the compartment to the wall was significantly decreased; and the distance between electrodes was greatly shortened. MSWIFT achieved 6 to 50 times faster IET separations compared to other MCEs. The second device, named ConFrac, was developed to simultaneously fractionate and concentrate ampholytic components from a complex sample into 0. 1 -mL collection compartments. By designing a system with a 2 -dimensional pH gradient and allowing recirculation of the sample feed, the ConFrac demonstrated enrichment of analytes by a factor of 100 and greater...|$|E
