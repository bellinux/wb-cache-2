40|$|Burdekin Falls Dam is Sunwater's primary {{water storage}} for North Queensland. With a total storage of 1, 860, 000 ML, {{it is the}} largest water {{reservoir}} in Queensland, capable of supplying 1, 000, 000 ML of water per annum. During the 1991 routine safety inspection of the dam it was observed that the radial gate vibrated considerably when operated in conjunction with the <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>gate.</b> This project aims to determine the likely source and cause of observed vibrations in the radial gate through scale hydraulic modelling and to develop recommendations and plans to reduce the vibration and remove the possibility of damage to the gates...|$|E
5000|$|Water is {{released}} through {{three sets of}} gates. The crest spillway is controlled by 8 radial gates, each 9.3 m high and 14 m wide. The bottom sluiceway is controlled by three <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>gates</b> of 3 x 2.5 m. There is also a tunnel spillway, consisting of a tunnel 386.13 m long and 10 m wide. With all gates open the dam can release [...] of floodwater.|$|R
5000|$|The Falcon Dam is a 150 ft {{high and}} 26,294 ft long earthen {{embankment}} dam. The dam {{is made of}} [...] of earth-fill, [...] of concrete and 10,300 ST of reinforced steel. The center of the dam is over-topped with a 1,300 ft long spillway with widths ranging from 350 ft {{at the top and}} 600 ft at the bottom. The spillway is controlled by six 50 x 50 ft <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>gates</b> and can release up to [...] downstream.|$|R
5000|$|The dam is a {{concrete}} gated weir design, 5985 ft long, with a structural height of 52 ft. Eleven <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>gates,</b> each 60 ft wide and 18 ft high, control the outflow {{of water to}} the Sacramento River. The concrete piers between the gates are 8 ft in width. The entire structure contains about [...] of concrete. Lake Red Bluff, formed by the dam when the gates are lowered, had a maximum depth of 13 ft, a normal storage of , and a maximum storage of [...] The original design of the dam included two fish ladders, one on {{each end of the}} dam; a third was added in 1984 {{in the middle of the}} dam.|$|R

50|$|The SZD-24 Foka series were Standard class gliders of {{predominantly}} wooden construction with <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> and skid undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> {{with either}} 6 or 8 support legs, and {{optional}} self-rotating capsules. 56 passenger cars, each {{able to carry}} 8 people.|$|R
50|$|These {{cars were}} mixed first- and second-class {{versions}} of the standard <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> rollingstock. First Class compartments were slightly wider, allowing for more legroom.|$|R
25|$|A109K2: High-altitude and {{high-temperature}} {{operations with}} <b>fixed</b> <b>wheels</b> {{rather than the}} retractable wheels of most A109 variants. Typically used by police, search and rescue, and air ambulance operators.|$|R
50|$|By April 1910, the WS fleet {{numbered}} 1 - 120. In the 1910 recoding, the WS class letters became simply _W__. The {{vehicles were}} re-numbered {{in the process}} which makes research from the Diagram Books difficult. Construction and conversion into this group continued after April 1910 as the 'W' class and in that number group.TypesThe WS class includes conversions from: _AB_ First/Second class <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> cars, _B__ / _BH_ Second class <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> cars, _E__ mail vans and _D__ Guards Vans. 1-8WS became 2-9W; 10-12WS became 1-3WW; 13-118WS became 11-118W.|$|R
50|$|Two-place model {{introduced}} in 2006, BHPA certified in 2007 {{and still in}} production in 2012, made from 7075-T6 aluminum tubing. Has optional <b>fixed</b> <b>wheeled</b> landing gear with bungee suspension.|$|R
50|$|Sheil was {{the first}} British rider to ride a 25-mile time-trial in 55 minutes, using a 48x15 <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1957. He held {{national}} records at 5, 10, 25 miles and 1 hour (26miles 1398yds).|$|R
50|$|The railway {{records show}} twenty two <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> mail vans in service. They {{were given the}} code E and were {{numbered}} 1 - 22, and externally resembled D guard's vans without the cupola at one end.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 he rode {{his first}} 25 mi race {{in less than}} an hour, riding a 78 in gear <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel,</b> the highest gear he had ridden. In 1959 he beat the record for the {{distance}} with 55m 11s.|$|R
50|$|The canoeable {{portion of}} the river can be {{accessed}} by <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> aircraft at an airstrip at Sheslay {{which is at the}} junction of the Sheslay and Hackett Rivers. A 2 km portage leads from the airstrip to the Sheslay.|$|R
40|$|The {{curve line}} {{translation}} motion {{can be generated}} in the particular form of the circular translation, through mono-mobile mechanisms with articulated links of simple parallelogram type (with a fixed side) or through transmission with toothed belt with a <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel.</b> Also, the circular translation can be generated through planar mechanisms with two cylindrical gears with a <b>fixed</b> central <b>wheel.</b> It is mentioned that the two cylindrical gearings of the Fergusson mechanisms are both exterior and interior...|$|R
5|$|On 24 May 2002, Queen ElizabethII {{opened the}} Falkirk Wheel {{as part of}} her Golden Jubilee celebrations. The opening was delayed a month due to {{flooding}} caused by vandals who forced open the <b>wheel's</b> <b>gates.</b> The damage, which cost Â£350,000 to repair, resulted in the dry well being flooded, damaging electrical and hydraulic equipment.|$|R
25|$|The main {{undercarriage}} had one <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> on each side, mounted on three diagonally-braced struts, {{one to the}} upper and two to the lower edge of the fuselage; there was a single tailwheel. Ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings.|$|R
25|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was an American catapult-launched {{observation}} floatplane. It was {{a compact}} mid-wing monoplane, {{with a large}} central float and small stabilizing floats. Performance was modest, because of its light engine. The OS2U could also operate on <b>fixed,</b> <b>wheeled,</b> taildragger landing gear.|$|R
50|$|An {{articulated}} locomotive with no <b>fixed</b> <b>wheels</b> (i.e. excluding the Mallet locomotive but including other articulated steam locomotives, {{as well as}} most diesel and electric locomotives) may have a separate frame beneath the superstructure, or the bodywork's internal structure may be load-bearing. Rarely is a true monocoque structure used.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the {{railways}} experimented by placing several sets of roller bearing axles under U vans. As more bogie rolling stock was being built {{it was decided}} that further <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> tests were inappropriate; vans already fitted retained the roller bearings, but no new wagons were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} include a tandem cockpit, starboard tail rotor with a port tailplane, a <b>fixed</b> <b>wheeled</b> undercarriage {{as well as}} wire cutters {{above and below the}} cockpit and on the undercarriage. When the Rooivalk first came out, it was the only helicopter in the world that could fly upside down.|$|R

25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is mainly}} built with wood, a semi-monocoque construction with steel tubes for wing attachments. The two seat cockipt has dual controls. The empennage is conventional, with a braced tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. The landing gear is a forward skid with elastic dampers and a single, <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> aft of the centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Hans Luenger {{imported}} one Condor IV-2 to the United States in 1952. After {{the wooden}} fuselage was damaged {{he built a}} new design replacement from welded steel tube and covered it with doped fabric. The new fuselage included a <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> for landing gear. This aircraft {{was removed from the}} US Federal Aviation Administration registry in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The MBR-2 was {{designed}} by Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev and first flew in 1931, powered by an imported 373 kW (500 hp) BMW VI.Z engine. Production models, which arrived in 1934, used a licence-built version of this engine, the Mikulin M-17 of 508 kW (680 hp), and could be fitted with a <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> or ski undercarriage.|$|R

50|$|Battery-operated trains {{were still}} available. The motor was kept unchanged. Upgrading a {{battery-operated}} train to a 12-volt electric train required {{changes to the}} train to fit the smaller, redesigned 12-volt motor underneath. The <b>fixed</b> <b>wheels</b> of the new 12-volt motor were black, finalizing the color scheme that had developed in the blue-track era, where 12-volt locomotives started to be distinguished by black wheels.|$|R
50|$|As the Z <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> vans {{were long}} overdue for {{retirement}} {{by the early}} 1970s, the railways decided to build a batch of ZF vans, numbered 1-50. These were different from the 1960s batch of ZF vans (which were by now the ZLP's), in that {{the design of the}} body had different window arrangements, different periscopes and different door locations.|$|R
50|$|Transportable Ferris {{wheels are}} {{designed}} to be operated at multiple locations, as opposed to <b>fixed</b> <b>wheels</b> which are usually intended for permanent installation. Small transportable designs may be permanently mounted on trailers, and can be moved intact. Larger transportable wheels {{are designed to}} be repeatedly dismantled and rebuilt, some using water ballast instead of the permanent foundations of their fixed counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{project is}} funded by Landsvirkjun, which {{operates}} the dams and FljÃ³tsdalur Power Station. The Italian company Impregilo is the largest contractor working on the dams. The {{total cost of the}} hydropower project is 1.3 billion USD. The penstock was built in place by the German company DSD-NOELL (WÃ¼rzburg) whereas ATB Riva Calzoni of Italy provided intake structures, <b>wheels</b> <b>gates</b> and sliding gates. In total, more than 4,000 tons of steel were used for the steel liner.|$|R

50|$|Engers' career {{included}} track racing - {{he raced}} against Tom Simpson and Barry Hoban at Herne Hill velodrome in 1963 {{and he won}} medals in the national pursuit championship. In July 1969 he won the national kilometre time trial on the track. His 1959 25 mi time-trial record of 55m 11s, set when he was 19, was ridden on an 84 in <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{components of}} the bike should also be considered. A middle grade dÃ©railleur is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes are equipped with hub gears. If the rider plans {{a significant amount of}} hillclimbing a triple-chainrings crankset gear system may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive double chainring may be better. Much simpler <b>fixed</b> <b>wheel</b> bikes are also available.|$|R
