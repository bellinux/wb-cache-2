5000|$|Cephalopods, {{as active}} marine predators, possess sensory organs {{specialized}} {{for use in}} aquatic conditions. [...] They have a camera-type eye which consists of an iris, a circular lens, vitreous cavity (<b>eye</b> <b>gel),</b> pigment cells, and photoreceptor cells that translate light from the light-sensitive retina into nerve signals which travel along the optic nerve to the brain. For the past 140 years, the camera-type cephalopod eye has been compared with the vertebrate eye {{as an example of}} convergent evolution, where both types of organisms have independently evolved the camera-eye trait and both share similar functionality. Contention exists on whether this is truly convergent evolution or parallel evolution. Unlike the vertebrate camera eye, the cephalopods' form as invaginations of the body surface (rather than outgrowths of the brain), and consequently they lack a cornea. Unlike the vertebrate eye, a cephalopod eye is focused through movement, much like the lens of a camera or telescope, rather than changing shape as the lens in the human eye does. The eye is approximately spherical, as is the lens, which is fully internal.|$|E

Methods: Patients who underwent pterygium surgery were separated into two groups. Forty patients in group 1 were given <b>eye</b> <b>gel</b> containing sodium hyaluronate, xanthan gum, and netilmycine, and 40 patients in group 2 were given one drop of <b>eye</b> <b>gel</b> containing fusidic acid. The patients in both groups were examined at the 12 th, 24 th, and 48 th hours in the postoperative period by using slit-lamp technique. The subjective complaints of the patients such as pain and stinging, and the recovery periods of the corneal epithelial defect were evaluated comparatively by fluorescein staining. Results: The mean ages were 26 ± 8 years (range: 18 – 35) and 24 ± 6 years (range: 18 – 33) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The closure period of the corneal epithelial defect was observed as 24 ± 8 hours (range: 16 – 42) and 36 ± 12 hours (range: 18 – 48) in groups  1 and 2, respectively. The number of the patients suffering from subjective complaints such as pain and stinging in the first 12  hours was six and 29 in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

40|$|Background: Floppy eyelid {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disorder characterized by tarsal atonia, common spontaneous eversion of the upper eyelids in conjunction with chronic papillary conjunctivitis. Floppy eyelid {{syndrome is}} a frequent cause of recurrent keratitis of different severity up to corneal ulceration.   Aim: To assess tear production, tear film and status of cornea in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome. Materials and methods: We examined 8 women aged 47 – 81 years (median 59 years) with clinical signs of floppy eyelid syndrome. For functional assessment, Schirmer and Norn tests were used.   Results: All patients had dry eye syndrome due to increased evaporation and fluid loss from the ocular surface in combination with meibomian gland dysfunction. In all cases, keratitis of varied severity was diagnosed: pitted corneal erosions in 7 patients, severe keratitis on 1 patient.

40|$|Abstract Background Reversible {{assembly}} and disassembly of nanostructures has important function in controllable construction of nanodevices. There are several methods to achieve reversible assembly/disassembly, such as pH, temperature, DNA hybridization and so on. Among these methods, pH driven reversible assembly presents superiority {{due to its}} ease-of-use and no waste produced. Herein we report a novel design that use two single-stranded (ss) DNAs wrapped single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for the pH controlled assembly of SWCNTs without generation of waste. Results Both of the two DNAs with a same wrapping sequence of d(GT) 20 and different free terminals showed a very high tendency to wrap around carbon nanotubes. The assembly was driven by the hybridization between the two free terminals of wrapped DNAs on the neighboring SWCNTs: i-motif (four-stranded C-quadruplex) and its complemental stranded G-quadruplex which would form tight tetraplexes and break the hybridization under slightly acidic conditions. Thus the {{assembly and}} disassembly are reversibly controlled by pH. And this assembly/disassembly process can be easily distinguished by naked <b>eyes.</b> <b>Gel</b> electrophoresis and Atomic Force Microscope are used to demonstrate the assembly and disassembly of SWCNTs at different pH. Conclusions A novel pH induced reversible assembly and disassembly of SWCNTs was realized which may have potential applications {{in the area of}} controlled assembly of nanostructures. </p...|$|R

Fresh porcine eyes were positioned in a specially developed holder and transfixed to the retinal layers with a microwire, and the other end was fixed to the load cell of a strain gauge. the cutter to be assessed was introduced into the eye by a micromanipulator at a 45 angle adjacent to the retina. the traction force was evaluated when the cutter was at 3 and 5 mm from the retina. As control, the experiment was repeated in eyes filled with water, and the results were compared to those when the <b>eyes</b> had vitreous <b>gel.</b> RESULTS. Results from the <b>eyes</b> with vitreous <b>gel</b> indicate that retinal traction increased with increasing aspiration vacuum (7. 90 dyn for each 100 mm Hg increased; P < 0. 05) and proximity to the retina (2. 17 dyn; P < 0. 05) and decreased with increasing cut rate (2. 51 dyn for each 500 cuts per minute increased; P < 0. 05). in all eyes filled with water, traction was not observed.

Participants and methods: One hundred and fifty eyes of 150 IVI-naïve patients with macular edema caused by various pathological conditions (age-related macular degeneration, central or branch retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic retinopathy) were scheduled to undergo an IVI of ranibizumab (0. 5 mg/ 0. 05 cc).

The incidence of clinically significant intraocular hypertensive spikes (> 25 mmHg and > 40 mmHg) was then assessed. Results: Our findings showed that mean IOP at baseline was significantly higher than at both 5 and 60 minutes after IVI (P 25 mmHg were recorded at either time in 27 patients (54 %) in group 1, 23 patients (44 %) in group 2, and 24 patients (48 %) in group 3. None of the between-group differences were significant. Spikes of > 40 mmHg (which were only detected 5 minutes after IVI) were recorded in nine (18 %), eight (16 %), and one patient (2 %) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The only significant difference was between the control and group 3 (P= 0. 012). Conclusion: An increase in IOP after antivascular endothelial growth factor IVI is a frequent complication. The prophylactic use of timolol 0. 1 % gel effectively reduced the mean IOP when administered 2 hours before IVI and was also effective in preventing dangerous IOP spikes of > 40 mmHg.

2500|$|Ethidium bromide is {{commonly}} used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a UV lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to <b>eyes</b> and skin, <b>gels</b> stained with ethidium bromide are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer's eyes and exposed skin should be protected. [...] In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit {{a higher degree of}} resolution, and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.|$|R

Patients and methods: Patients with traumatic corneal abrasions were randomly treated as follows: Group A (n = 20) with an occlusive patching for 12 hours plus one drop of an <b>eye</b> <b>gel</b> containing 0. 15 % sodium hyaluronate, 1 % xanthan gum and 0. 3 % netilmicin qid for 5 days; and Group B (n = 20) with an occlusive patching for 2 &ndash; 3 days plus one application of 0. 3 % netilmicin ophthalmic ointment qid for 5 days. All patients were evaluated after the third and seventh day by slit-lamp examination, fluorescein staining, and corneal defect photograph in order to assess corneal re-epithelialization. Conjunctival hyperaemia, lid oedema, subjective symptoms of discomfort, and conjunctival swabs were also evaluated. Results: No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of the extent of corneal healing after 3 days of treatment. Both treatments were also highly effective in decreasing the erosion score and the conjunctival hyperemia (P &lt; 0. 0001, P &lt; 0. 005, respectively) without any significant difference between the two types of treatment. Subjective symptoms of discomfort and conjunctival swabs were also evaluated. Conclusion: In the management of traumatic corneal abrasions, the administration of an <b>eye</b> <b>gel</b> containing sodium hyaluronate and xanthan gum is able to reduce the length of occlusive patching. In addition, the presence of netilmicin guarantees good antibiotic prophylaxis during the wound repair process. Keywords: netilmicin, xanthan gum, wound healing, patching, corneal abrasio...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the use of collagen gel loaded with human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE 19) in cellular transfer and to assess its viability within the gel. Collagen solution was prepared by dissolving calfskin in hydrochloric acid to make a final concentration of 2. 0 mg/ml and this was mixed with 10, 000 ARPE 19 cells/ml. The cell viability in gel was determined using MTT assay. van Gieson stain and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were used to identify the location of collagen and to localize the site of cell proliferation, respectively. The ARPE 19 cells in gel appeared to be healthy with a rounded morphology. The optimal collagen concentration was 1. 9 mg/ml. When this concentration was used to hold cells for over 12 days, it could be seen that the growth rate was the same between day 2 and day 8 in get and on plastic. When the cell-loaded gels were transferred onto standard tissue culture plastics, progressive cell migrations over time resembling cell migrations in organotypic explant cultures were observed. Upon intravitreal injection of cell-containing collagen suspension into a rabbit's <b>eye,</b> the <b>gel</b> became suspended within the vitreous a few hours after injection (day 0). However, it became obvious that the gel dispersed and spread around the vitreous even after just 24 h. These cells inside the vitreous were PCNA positive, indicating that the human ARPE 19 cells have the capacity to proliferate even after I I days. The present study demonstrated the potential use of collagen gel as a tool in the transfer of cellular matrix onto other substrates. The results show that the cell seeding number must be critically balanced with the concentration of gel for it to be used as transplant material...|$|R
5000|$|Moisturizers are creams or lotions that hydrate {{the skin}} and help it to retain moisture; they may contain {{essential}} oils, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain {{a small amount of}} foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared {{with the rest of the}} face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or Vitamin K to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. <b>Eye</b> creams or <b>gels</b> should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop and {{characterize}} an ion-activated in situ gel-forming estradiol (E 2) solution eye drops intended for the prevention of age-related cataracts. Accordingly, in situ <b>gelling</b> <b>eye</b> drops were made using gellan gum as an ion-activated gel-forming polymer, polysorbate- 80 as drug solubilizing agent, mannitol as tonicity agent, and combination of potassium sorbate and edetate disodium dihydrate (EDTA) as preservatives. The formulations were tested for the following characteristics: pH, clarity, osmolality, antimicrobial efficacy, rheological behavior, and in vitro drug release. Stability of the formulation was also monitored for 6 months at multiple storage conditions per ICH Q 1 A (R 2) guidelines. The solution eye drops resulted in an in-situ phase change to gel-state when mixed with simulated tear fluid (STF). The gel structure formation was confirmed by viscoelastic measurements. Drug release from the gel followed non-fickian mechanism with 80 % of drug released in 8 hr. The formulations were found to be clear, isotonic with suitable pH and viscoelastic behavior and stable at accelerated and long-term storage conditions for 6 months. In vitro results suggest that the developed formulation is suitable for further investigation in animal models to elucidate the ability of estrogen to prevent and delay cataracts...|$|R
