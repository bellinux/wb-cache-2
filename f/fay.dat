5|$|Agnes <b>Fay</b> {{was born}} in 1884 in Peoria, Illinois. Her parents were Patrick <b>Fay</b> and his second wife, the former Mary Dooley. Patrick and Mary <b>Fay</b> had come from Galway, Ireland. He was a manual laborer and then a builder. Agnes <b>Fay</b> was the third of the family's four children. A {{graduate}} of Peoria High School, <b>Fay</b> received a full college scholarship from a local donor. She went to Vassar College {{for a short time}} before transferring to the University of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fay</b> {{accelerated}} {{towards the}} Texas coast and made landfall early on September 7. The storm meandered throughout inland Texas, {{and as the}} system moved inland, forward speed decreased and <b>Fay</b> weakened to a tropical depression. The last advisory was issued on <b>Fay</b> on September 7, although the depression persisted for several days just inland of the Texas Coast.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Fay</b> was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>Fay</b> evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm <b>Fay</b> steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, <b>Fay</b> briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on <b>Fay,</b> causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E

It is revealed by the ambassador that his country has captured a general {{who might have been}} helping <b>Fayed.</b> Buchanan persuades President Palmer to order the ambassador to have the captured general contact <b>Fayed.</b> Nadia Yassir warns Buchanan {{that there might be a}} distress signal encoded in the phone call. <b>Fayed</b> is later killed by Jack Bauer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fay's</b> {{steadily}} grew in Central New York—the resulting <b>Fay's</b> Drugs Company, Inc. {{was incorporated}} on October 20, 1966 and <b>Fay's</b> Drugs opened {{its headquarters in}} Syracuse, New York with the bulk of its operations residing in Liverpool, New York. At its peak there were over 300 stores operating in New York and Northeast Pennsylvania. <b>Fay's</b> enjoyed #1 market share in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.|$|R
50|$|One of Rascal's daughters, and granddaughter to Christopher, was {{paired with}} a {{purebred}} Swiss Alpine, to produce a fine line of American Lamanchas, {{one of which was}} 'Mickey'. Mickey gave birth to <b>Fay's</b> 'Mickey' L-64, who was then bred to <b>Fay's</b> Ernie L-1, which yielded both <b>Fay's</b> 'Erna' L-76 and <b>Fay's</b> 'Myrna' L-77. As of Mrs. Frey's 1960 writing, Myrna was owned by a Mr. Amos Nixon.|$|R
5|$|While {{teaching}} at the University of Montana in 1907–08, <b>Fay</b> married Arthur I. Morgan, who was a senior football player at the university. Though <b>Fay</b> had been Morgan's chemistry teacher, Morgan was four years older than <b>Fay,</b> having enrolled at Montana after military service in the Spanish–American War. Arthur Morgan became the headmaster of a boy's school and later worked for the Sperry Flour Company, becoming its vice president.|$|E

5|$|By 19 March Fay's track {{had turned}} to the west-southwest, {{and over the next}} day it {{continued}} to strengthen in due to favourable upper level outflow and weak vertical sheer. On 21 March, <b>Fay</b> became a Category5 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. A mid-latitude trough caused the steering ridge to weaken, and subsequently, <b>Fay</b> to turn to the south. Over the next two days, the environmental shear around the cyclone decreased, which would normally have led to intensification; however, as the shear decreased, the cyclone also moved over an area of dry air, weakening the system. By 23 March, <b>Fay</b> had moved in a loop, and the system weakened to a Category 2. Over the next day, favourable outflow counteracted the dry air that had weakened the system, and a banding eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. <b>Fay</b> then encountered moister air as it moved southward, leading it to re-intensify on 25 March. A weak eye of 10 nm was observed on 26 March which grew to 15nm as the day went on. Strengthening into a Category 4 system early on 27 March, <b>Fay</b> made landfall on the Pilbara coast between 8am and 9am AWST (0000 and 0100UTC) with winds of , weakening below cyclone strength somewhere between the towns of Nullagine and Telfer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fay</b> {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago as a physics major, but she changed her major to chemistry after taking a course in that subject from Julius Stieglitz. He was an influential chemist who {{became a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Chemical Society. <b>Fay</b> completed a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in chemistry in 1904 and 1905, respectively. For about a year, <b>Fay</b> was a college chemistry instructor, though there are conflicting sources as to the name of the college.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fay</b> {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} the studio to record a new album by American record {{producer}} Joshua Henry, who was a fan of Fay's Deram albums after he had heard them played by his father. <b>Fay</b> and Henry assembled a group of musicians that included guitarist Ray Russell and drummer Alan Rushton, who had both played on Time of the Last Persecution. Recording took place across ten days at Snap Studios in North London with engineer Guy Massey. It was released to critical acclaim, featuring on several critic's year-end lists and reaching number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. <b>Fay</b> donated the proceeds from the album to the humanitarian aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that <b>Fayed</b> moved to England where he lived in central London. In the mid 1960s, <b>Fayed</b> met the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid al Makhtoum who {{entrusted}} <b>Fayed</b> with helping transform Dubai. <b>Fayed</b> introduced British companies like the Costain Group (of which he became a director and 30 percent shareholder), Bernard Sunley & Sons and Taylor Woodrow to the Emirate {{to carry out the}} required construction work. He also became a financial adviser to the then Sultan of Brunei Omar Ali Saifuddien III, in 1966.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, <b>Fay's</b> Drugs {{was sold}} to JCPenney for $285 million in stock. JCPenney merged its drug {{operations}} into Eckerd in 1997. Many of the original <b>Fay's</b> Drugs locations {{that have not been}} closed in favor of stand-alone Eckerd stores (many now Rite Aid locations) still feature the familiar <b>Fay's</b> aisle and pharmacy formats that served as models for drug chains nationwide.|$|R

As {{a result of the}} murder, the U.S. Government seized all of the assets of e-Bullion, resulting in the closure of the company in August 2008.|$|R
5|$|Immediately after forming, {{the storm}} moved northwestward around the {{periphery}} of a ridge of high pressure in the central Atlantic. As <b>Fay</b> moved away from its parent upper low, wind shear once again increased. The National Hurricane Center originally expected the cyclone to remain weak, but <b>Fay</b> began organizing more quickly than anticipated. Relatively strong winds sampled by a Hurricane Hunters aircraft necessitated a special off-hour advisory to raise the cyclone's intensity estimate. The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system, and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center, Fay's wind speeds steadily increased. Upper-level air divergence from the nearby non-tropical low {{may have contributed to}} the storm's resilience. After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted, <b>Fay</b> transitioned into a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on October11. At the same time, the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge, soon gaining an easterly component to its movement. <b>Fay</b> remained heavily sheared, with the deepest convection still displaced from the center.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{nutrition}} laboratory at Berkeley was renamed Agnes <b>Fay</b> Morgan Hall.

5|$|Life Is People is {{the fourth}} studio album by English singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Bill <b>Fay,</b> released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. <b>Fay</b> had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. In order to support himself, <b>Fay</b> took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Metallizing {{has emerged}} as an {{effective}} protective coating for steel bridge members, providing a physical barrier and a galvanic protection. Recent {{research has shown that}} metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces used in high strength bolted connections provide higher slip resistance than specified values for uncoated blast-cleaned <b>faying</b> surfaces in North American design standards. As a particularity, relaxation of the clamping force is observed in the slip-critical connections with metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces. In this study, tests were designed to evaluate the effect of relaxation on the slip resistance of metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces in high strength bolted connections. Some design parameters included in this study are the coating thickness, the amount of bolt preload, the type of bolt and the presence of burrs. Test results showed that the relaxation of the clamping force does not adversely affect the slip resistance of connections with metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces...|$|R

5|$|Forecasters {{originally}} believed <b>Fay</b> to {{have only}} briefly been a hurricane, but post-season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a Category1 hurricane by early on October12 and maintained that strength for 12 hours. The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and weather radar data. At 08:10UTC, the cyclone made landfall on Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), the hurricane's peak intensity. <b>Fay</b> was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Emily in 1987. Its satellite presentation improved as a mid-level eye feature formed, though the system remained lopsided. <b>Fay</b> then accelerated toward the east-northeast ahead of a shortwave trough to the north, which also acted to further enhance shear in the area. The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low-level center decoupled from the mid-level low and became elongated. By {{the early morning hours}} of October13, <b>Fay</b> started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it entered a baroclinic environment and ingested colder, drier air. The circulation rapidly deteriorated; consequently, the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21:00UTC on October12. Early the following day, the storm degenerated into an open trough, ending its existence as a tropical cyclone. Shortly after, the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone, which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15.|$|E
