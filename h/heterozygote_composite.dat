40|$|Introduction: In {{children}} with cystic fibrosis (CF), low immunoglobulin (IgG) levels {{have been reported}} to be associated with significantly less severe lung disease. However, decreased IgG can be a sign for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and affect clinical outcome. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze clinical and serological data of patients having low IgG levels in routine blood tests at annual assessment, particularly their antibody response to polysaccharide antigens. Method: Retrospective chart review of demographic data of CF patients followed at the pediatric CF clinic throughout 2009. Clinical parameters (genotype, pancreas sufficiency, FEV 1), presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and number of exacerbations per year were correlated with immunoglobulin and vaccination antibodies levels (antibodies to pneumococcal serotypes 14, 19, 23, 1, 5 and 7 F measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay). Results: 4 out of 60 patients (6. 7 %) had lower IgG-levels for age. Ages ranged from 1 year 8 months to 11 years, 2 boys, 2 girls. Three patients were delF 508 homozygotes, one <b>heterozygote</b> <b>composite</b> delF 508 /G 542 X. All were pancreatic insufficient. FEV 1 ranged from 74 to 108 %. One patient never had colonization by PA, 2 had intermittent PA colonization and one was chronically infected. After conjugated vaccination all patients had protective antibodies against serotypes 14, 19, 23 F. For serotypes not included in the vaccine, only one patient had protective titers for 1 out of 3 serotypes. None of the patients had received unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine. There was no significant clinical difference in FEV 1, PA colonization or number of exacerbations according to IgG and vaccination antibody levels. Conclusion: Cystic Fibrosis patients with low immunoglobulin levels have normal antibody response to protein antigens. However, despite recurrent infections, there seems to be delayed or deficient antibody response to polysaccharide antigens. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the development of polysaccharide antibody responses in CF-patients to monitor for CVID. With early detection of CF by newborn screening program, long term follow up could be started early in childhood...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} oculopharyngeal {{muscular dystrophy}} (OPMD) is an adult-onset disease which is particularly frequent in the French Canadian population. It usually presents {{in the sixth}} decade with progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), eye lid drooping (ptosis) and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers are its pathological hallmark. This thesis charts the successful positional cloning of the gene responsible for OPMD, from its chromosomal localization by linkage to the identification of its causal mutations. A genome search using 166 polymorphic markers on a large French Canadian family established linkage to chromosome 14 q 11. 2 - q 13. Linkage analysis on 11 families of similar ancestry defined a 2 cM candidate interval. To better characterize the French Canadian founder effect we haplotyped 42 carrier chromosomes. Our molecular analysis confirms that a single OPMD mutation was introduced into this population. By combining genealogies with haplotype data we demonstrate that the mutation was likely brought to North America in 1648 by three French sisters. Our proposed Genealogy-based Estimate of Historical Meioses (GEHM) count fine-mapped the OPMD locus to a 0. 26 cM (217 kb) candidate interval in chromosome 14 q 11. We isolated the poly (A) binding protein 2 (PABP 2) gene from this region. A (GCG) 6 repeat encoding a polyalanine tract located at the NH 2 -terminus of the protein was expanded to (GCG) 8 - 13 in the 144 OPMD families screened. The French Canadian (GCG) 9 mutation {{appears to be the}} most frequent worldwide. Interestingly, more severe phenotypes were observed in <b>composite</b> <b>heterozygotes</b> for the (GCG) 9 mutation and a (GCG) 7 allele found in 2 % of the population, whereas homozygosity for the (GCG) 7 allele leads to autosomal recessive OPMD. Thus the (GCG) 7 allele {{is an example of a}} polymorphism which can act as either a modifier of a dominant phenotype or as a recessive mutation. We suggest that pathologica...|$|R
