5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (reigned 604–618), the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>provinces,</b> while the successive military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy ("Mandate of Heaven") among the provincial governors.
