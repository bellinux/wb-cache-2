The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania,</b> which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 1998, al-Qaeda {{struck the}} U.S. {{embassies}} <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania,</b> killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, U.S. President Bill Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach, a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan against targets the U.S. asserted {{were associated with}} WIFJAJC, although others have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan {{was used as a}} chemical warfare facility. The plant produced much of the region's antimalarial drugs and around 50% of Sudan's pharmaceutical needs. The strikes failed to kill any leaders of WIFJAJC or the Taliban.|$|E
25|$|In June 1998 CCDG-3 {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf. The deployment {{was the first}} on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. On 20 August 1998, the group took part in Operation Infinite Reach, launching Tomahawk cruise missiles against the Sudanese Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. This factory was suspected of assisting Osama Bin Laden in making chemical weapons. The Battle Group also launched a second wave of Tomahawk cruise missiles against Bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. These cruise missile strikes were ordered by President Bill Clinton 13 days after terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania.</b> Rear Admiral Kevin Green transferred command of the group to incoming Rear Adm. Phillip Balisle on 3 December 1999, aboard the flagship Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|On January 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} case, sentenced Ghailani, believed to be 36 {{years old at the}} time, to life in prison for the bombing, stating that any suffering Ghailani experienced {{at the hands of the}} CIA or other agencies while in custody at Guantanamo Bay pales in comparison to the monumental tragedy of the bombings of the U.S. embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> in 1998, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and left thousands injured or otherwise impacted by the crimes. The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.|$|E

500|$|The Taliban {{announced}} {{within a}} day that bin Laden had survived the attacks, which Wright notes strengthened his image in the Muslim world [...] "as a symbolic figure of resistance" [...] to the U.S. Bin Laden had prominent support in Pakistan, where two hagiographies of the al-Qaeda chief were soon published, parents began naming their newborn sons Osama, mosques distributed his taped speeches, and cargo trucks bore the slogan [...] "Long Live Osama". Children <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> wore bin Laden T-shirts, and al-Qaeda sold propaganda videos of the strikes' damage in European and Middle Eastern Islamic bookstores. A 1999 report prepared by Sandia National Laboratories stated that bin Laden [...] "appeared to many as an underdog standing firm {{in the face of}} bullying aggression," [...] adding that the missile strikes sparked further planning of attacks by extremists. Operation Infinite Reach also strengthened bin Laden's associates' support for him, and helped the al-Qaeda leader consolidate support among other Islamist militant groups. The attacks also helped al-Qaeda recruit new members and solicit funds. Naftali concludes that the strikes damaged the Khost camps but failed to deter al-Qaeda and [...] "probably intensified [...] hunger for violence." [...] Similarly, researcher Rohan Gunaratna told the 9/11 Commission that the attacks did not reduce the threat of al-Qaeda.|$|E

2500|$|Claims {{of direct}} Iraqi {{involvement}} come from Dr. Laurie Mylroie of the American Enterprise Institute and former {{associate professor of}} the U.S. Naval War College, with the claims rejected by others. CNN reporter Peter Bergen has called her a [...] "crackpot" [...] who claimed that [...] "Saddam was not only behind the '93 Trade Center attack, but also every anti-American terrorist incident of the past decade, from the bombings of U.S. embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> to the leveling of the federal building in Oklahoma City bombing to September 11 itself." [...] Daniel Benjamin, {{a senior fellow at}} the Center for Strategic and International Studies, writes: [...] "The most knowledgeable analysts and investigators at the CIA and at the FBI believe that their work conclusively disproves Mylroie's claims." [...] Dr. Robert Leiken of the Nixon Center comments on the lack of evidence in her work: [...] "Laurie has discovered Saddam's hand in every major attack on US interests since the Persian Gulf War, including U.S. embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> and even the federal building in Oklahoma City. These allegations have all been definitively refuted by the FBI, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other investigatory bodies...." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese {{government}} of the National Islamic Front had begun {{to back away from}} its previous hard-line stance. [...] This was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the National Islamic Front government. [...] U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies <b>in</b> <b>Kenya</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tanzania</b> by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan. [...] Over the next several years, Khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the LRA.
