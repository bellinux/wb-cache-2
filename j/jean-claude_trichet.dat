25|$|European {{political}} leaders embarked on substantial austerity drives. In July 2010, leading European economic policy maker <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet,</b> {{president of the}} ECB, stated {{that it was time}} for all industrial nations to stop stimulating and start tightening. Keynesian economists and Keynes biographer Lord Skidelsky contested the move to implement cuts given the still fragile economy.|$|E

50|$|Mersch {{has been}} {{regarded}} as relatively hawkish on interest rate policy. While in May 2010 he voiced concerns over <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet’s</b> unconditional debt-purchasing programme, he - unlike Jens Weidmann of Germany - supported Mario Draghi’s conditional plan to buy government bonds.|$|R
5000|$|In a late November, 2011, {{speech in}} Berlin, Weidmann criticized the errors and [...] "many years of wrong developments" [...] of the EMU’s {{peripheral}} states, particularly the wasted opportunity represented by their [...] "disproportionate investment in private home-building, high government spending or private consumption", David Marsh reported. In early December, with {{another in a}} string of Eurozone summits imminent, Bloomberg commented that the new ECB head Mario Draghi [...] "knows he can't afford to repeat" [...] his predecessor <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet's</b> mistake of alienating the Bundesbank. Draghi was said in the report to be courting Weidmann by, among others, Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays in London.|$|R
500|$|In September 2011, EU {{commissioner}} Joaquín Almunia {{shared this}} view, saying that expelling weaker countries from the euro {{was not an}} option: [...] "Those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration". The former ECB president <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet</b> also denounced {{the possibility of a}} return of the Deutsche Mark.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Jürgen Stark {{became the}} second German after Axel A. Weber {{to resign from}} the ECB Governing Council in 2011. Weber, the former Deutsche Bundesbank president, was {{once thought to be}} a likely {{successor}} to <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet</b> as bank president. He and Stark were both thought to have resigned due to [...] "unhappiness with the ECB's bond purchases, which critics say erode the bank's independence".|$|E
500|$|The {{crisis is}} {{pressuring}} the Euro {{to move beyond}} a regulatory state and towards a more federal EU with fiscal powers. Increased European integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on 14 June 2012 by Jens Weidmann President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, expanding on ideas first proposed by <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet,</b> {{former president of the}} European Central Bank. Control, including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut, would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed. This proposal is similar to contemporary calls by Angela Merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would [...] "allow Europe oversight possibilities".|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Briefing Paper is {{to discuss the issue}} of Treaty reform and its {{consequences}} for monetary policy. Inter alia, the changes include that the institutional set-up will be subtly changed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be grouped {{in the first part of}} the Treaty as one of the "other institutions and advisory bodies". Possibly more importantly, the euro area as such will be in the position to act legally as itself within the European Union (EU) legal structures. The Eurogroup also will be officially recognized ("Euro-Ecofin-Council"). The rules for enhanced cooperation have also been further facilitated from the Treaty of Nice, also applying for the area of economic governance (e. g. euro area coordination, tax policy, exchange rates). What should we think of these reforms? Will they make euro area governance more efficient and/or could they potentially jeopardize the independence of European monetary policy and the European Central Bank (ECB) ? From a theoretical point of view it can be argued that an independent central bank may reduce the inflationary bias of monetary policy making. A substantial amount of empirical research supports the inverse relationship between central bank independence and the level of inflation. The negative relationship between indicators of central bank independence and inflation in OECD countries is quite robust, also if various control variables are included in the regression.

President <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet's</b> concern about the status of the ECB under the new Treaty and fear that by including the bank in a list of EU institutions implies a risk that EU member states could formulate policy recommendations to the ECB, but may also lead to more central bank conservatism with the ECB as explained in our analysis. In this paper we analyze the trade-off between central bank independence and conservatism with New Keynesian framework following Woodford [Woodford, M., 2003. Interest and prices: foundations of a theory of monetary policy. Princeton University Press, Princeton. ] and others. Our conclusion is that the trade-off between central bank independence and conservatism still holds within the New Keynesian framework. Politicians should therefore realize that their attempts to downgrade ECB's independence legally and verbally will only increase its conservatism in order to maintain the same inflationary bias and limit the ECB's degrees of freedom with respect to its interest rate policy.

2500|$|The Eurozone is {{a special}} case where some members, principally Germany, enjoy a large current account surplus and so could accept or even benefit from {{currency}} appreciation. [...] Other countries though such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have twin deficits and so {{to a large extent}} would benefit from a depreciation. [...] While the European Central Bank (ECB) did practice some QE in 2009, this was to a much lower extent than the US or UK, and they did not deploy a second round. The value of the Euro has been effectively left to float, and in fact early in 2010 central authorities intervened to defend the Euro’s value against the market. Following the generally positive results from bank stress testing that were released in summer, [...] market participants stopped speculating against the Euro, and the currency has tended to rise as a result of other countries practicing competitive devaluation. A major driver for the rise in the Euro {{in the latter half of}} 2010 was China's purchase of Euro-denominated bonds. While China's intervention was in some ways helpful for the Eurozone, it also generated concern with several European officials speaking out against the action. These officials included: [...] ECB governor <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Trichet</b> and Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker.|$|E
