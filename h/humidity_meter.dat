30|$|Testing {{commenced}} {{on top of}} {{the central}} platform at Huánuco Pampa on 4 July 2015, at 10  a.m. The weather was cloudier than a typical “dry season” day in the northern Peruvian highlands, and dark clouds to the southwest signaled an approaching storm. Winds increased around 11  a.m., occasionally contributing to 50 – 70  dBA measured peak noise levels during gusts; typical background noise readings without gusts were around 35  dBA. The storm moved into the area around 2  pm, with rain and hail starting around 3 : 30  p.m., marking the practical end of fieldwork. Although we have used temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>meters</b> in previous Andean archaeoacoustics work—and strongly recommend logging these environmental data, along with wind speed and direction—we did not have access to meteorological tools. We noted the directionality of windy gusts, their noise level peaks (via sound level meter), and based on our team’s extensive experience in Andean fieldwork, made estimates of temperature (12 – 16  ℃), and humidity (47 – 68 %). Temperature and humidity measures are useful in calculating the speed of sound during an acoustical survey, which can be used for alternate distance calibration with video-documented points, and data-driven acoustical modeling.|$|R

The DNA film was deposited using drop-casting method onto a glass substrate pre-deposited with Al {{followed by an}} Al contact to fabricate the Al/DNA/Al Schottky junctions. Alpha radiation irradiation was then carried-out for different periods (10, 20, 30 and 40 min). Results indicate an initial increase followed by a drastic drop in {{the resistance of the}} film at 257, 289, 421, 587 and 129 kΩ times and for pristine or non-radiated, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively, with a rise in the relative humidity level. It was also observed that under the effect of humidity, the capacitance of the DNA thin film increased to 935, 581, 1035, 301 and 329 nF times for the same corresponding exposure periods. The capacitive/resistive sensor was found to demonstrate a quasi-linear function with relative humidity in the range of 20 - 99. 9 % with only a small hysteresis and a response/recovery time of about 120 s.

40|$|Handheld {{temperature}} and relative <b>humidity</b> (T/RH) <b>meters</b> {{are commonly used}} in residential indoor air surveys. Although popular, T/RH meters are prone to sensor drift and consequent loss of accuracy, and thus instrument manufacturers often recommend annual calibration and adjustment. Field-use conditions, however, {{have been shown to}} accelerate electronic sensor drift in outdoor applications, resulting in out-of-tolerance measurements in less than one year. In the study described in this article, sensor drift was evaluated under residential field use for 30 handheld T/RH meters to predict needed calibration intervals based on hierarchical linear modeling. Instruments were used in 43 home visits over a 93 -day period and were calibrated (without adjustment) 49 times over the study period with a laboratory standard. Analysis of covariance showed significant drift among temperature sensors for all three instrument types (p 3 ̆c. 0001) and among humidity sensors in two instruments.

40|$|The vapor liquid-equilibrium {{of water}} + ionic liquids is {{relevant}} {{for a wide}} range of applications of these compounds. It is usually measured by ebulliometric techniques, but these are time consuming and expensive. In this work it is shown that the activity coefficients of water in a series of cholinium-based ionic liquids can be reliably and quickly estimated at 298. 15 K using a <b>humidity</b> <b>meter</b> instrument. The cholinium based ionic liquids were chosen to test this experimental methodology since data for water activities of quaternary ammonium salts are available in the literature allowing the validation of the proposed technique. The COSMO-RS method provides a reliable description of the data and was also used to understand the molecular interactions occurring on these binary systems. The estimated excess enthalpies indicate that hydrogen bonding between water and ionic liquid anion is the dominant interaction that governs the behavior of water and cholinium-based ionic liquids systems, while the electrostatic-misfit and van der Walls forces have a minor contribution to the total excess enthalpies. The results here reported show that water activity measurements allow a quick scan for selecting ionic liquids according to their behavior in mixtures with water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Some {{researches}} have doubts that it occurred during last two decades, but allergic pathology spread increased in several times more and continue to grow. That’s why the cause should be searched in the epigenetic influences (environmental, food, ets.). More than the half of the modern hypothesis concerning allergy spread are associated with food (7 from 13).

40|$|Southeast {{region of}} the country has hot and dry weather which causes to happen heavy {{rainfall}} in short time period of warm seasons and to occur river flooding. These precipitations are influenced by monsoon system of India ocean. In these thesis, It was tried to evaluate the relation between thermal anomaly of sea surface in India ocean and Arab sea which effects on southeast monsoon precipitations of Iran, For evaluation of this happening in southeast, data were collected from 7 synoptic observation stations of Bandar Abbas, Minab, Kerman, Bam, Chabahar, Iranshahr, Zahedan and 17 rain gauge stations during June to September of each year from 1980 to 2010. Rainy days were determine and then some information about synoptic circulation models, maps of average pressure of sea surface, geopotential height of 700 hP surface, geopotential height of 500 hP surface, temperature of 850 hPa surface, humidity of 700 hPa surface, vertical velocity of 700 hPa surface, vertical velocity of 500 hP and <b>humidity</b> of 2 <b>meters</b> height for 6 systems were extracted from NCEP/NCAR website for evaluation. By evaluation of these systems it was determined that the monsoon low pressure system tab brings needed humidity of these precipitations to this region from India ocean and Arab sea with a vast circulation. It is seen that warm air pool locates on Iran and cold air pool locates on west of India at 800 hPa surface. In a rainy day this warm air transfers to high latitudes and influences the temperature trough of southeast cold air pool of the country. In the middle surfaces of 700 and 500 hPa, the connection between low height system above India and low height system above the higher latitudes causes the low height system above India to be strength and developed. By evaluation of <b>humidity</b> at 2 <b>meters</b> height and 700 hPa surface we observe that humidity Increases in the southeast region. With penetrating of the low height system of India above the 700 and 500 hPa surfaces of southeast of Iran, the value of negative omega (Rising vertical velocity) is increased. In the second pace, it was shown the evaluation of how the correlation between sea surface temperature anomaly in India Ocean and Arab sea influences southeast monsoon precipitation of Iran. For this purpose the data of water surface temperature anomaly of Arab sea and India ocean, the data of precipitation anomaly of 7 synoptic stations, mentioned above, and correlation coefficient among the data of precipitation anomaly and water surface temperature anomaly of Arab Sea, east and west of India ocean were calculated. In conclusion it was shown that the maximum correlation coefficient of precipitation anomaly had belonged to India Ocean in June and no meaningful correlation was resulted in July among precipitation anomaly and sea surface temperature anomaly for three regions, which were evaluated...|$|R

Understanding this phenomenon and the required ambient conditions {{is key to}} preventing ice related failures in the future. This paper investigates the required ambient temperature and relative humidity for inlet ice formation. It presents the data collected from an on site ambient temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>meter</b> {{as well as a}} real time bell-mouth inlet camera. An ambient temperature and relative <b>humidity</b> <b>meter</b> was installed on site and used to protect the turbine by shutting it down (trip) based on high relative humidity and low ambient temperatures. The initial criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) used to trip and protect the unit were a combination of an educated guess and values cited in General Electric document Gas Turbine Inlet Air Treatment. [1] To further refine these trip parameters and better understand the inlet icing process, a camera was installed in the turbine inlet housing {{with a view of the}} bell-mouth and inlet guide vanes (IGV). This provided real time images of the inlet icing phenomena that was then correlated with the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). Also, the camera images showed, after a significant icing event, that pieces of ice sloughed off the IGVs and were ingested by the turbine. Weather Radar data collected from www. weather. com shows that this can occur without precipitation. The theory of inlet ice formation was investigated using the Magnus equation for dew-point calculations and the ?Ideal Gas Law? with an assumption of constant specific heat for the flowing inlet temperature depression. Using a temperature recovery factor of. 8 (this has been supported by numerical modeling in previous research by Stewart [2]) the inlet guide vane temperature depression was predicted to be 6. 9 ?F (3. 8 ?C). With this IGV temperature depression, icing was predicted for ambient temperatures less then 38. 9 ?F (32 + 6. 9 ?F) (3. 8 ?C) and RH above 74 to 76 %. Evidence is also given for inlet ice formation on a General Electric model Frame 3 turbine at the same location. The collected RH, ambient temperature data and inlet camera images suggest condensate and not precipitate icing could be the root cause of the past ice ingestion failures. With the ambient temperature, RH data and bell-mouth camera images, the temperature depression at the inlet guide vanes was measured to be about 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C). The temperature recovery factor (RF) was shown to be 0. 73. A 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C) IGV temperature drop will result in IGV ice when ambient temperatures are below 41. 5 ?F (32 + 9. 5 ?F) (5. 3 ?C) and RH above 67 to 69 %. Setting the trip criteria to guarantee ice free operation will negatively impact the reliability and drop it to unacceptable levels. The original trip criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) remain and are now seen as an acceptable compromise. Inlet air heating as a method of preventing inlet ice formation will be discussed. The amount of heat added to the inlet air to guarantee ice free operation is determined to be greater than 250 hp (186 kW). Finally, options for the inlet air heating energy source are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{heat stress}} {{is a cause}} of many {{occupational}} disorders that disrupt worker performance {{and the quality of}} work and, in extreme cases, can lead to death. In the industrial context, thermal discomfort is cited as one of the major causes of dissatisfaction in workplaces when people are exposed to extremely hot or cold thermal environments. Given the time that people spend in their workplaces, studies evaluating the comfort of the thermal environment are becoming increasingly important. However, comfort evaluation studies are time-consuming and for many organizations become expensive and difficult to implement {{due to the lack of}} a simplified model for evaluating the thermal environment of workplaces and the thermal sensations of their occupants. This paper aims to show the possibility of assessing the thermal patterns of industrial spaces and consequently identifying the most critical areas in terms of thermal comfort, using thermal indexes supported by real data collected using inexpensive measuring tools. This study was carried out in two Portuguese industrial manufacturing facilities with different characteristics, evaluating the thermal environment and the workers' thermal sensation in the season of spring. The data related to environmental parameters were collected using two similar measuring instruments, Testo 435 - 4 and Center 317 - temperature <b>humidity</b> <b>meter,</b> while the workers' thermal sensations were collected using a thermal sensation colour scale that is aligned with the ASHRAE seven-point thermal sensation scale. The results were reproduced in colour maps based on MatLab algorithms, using the calculation formula of three thermal indexes, EsConTer (a new index), THI, and PPD. The applied methodology, using the EsConTer index, proved to be an interesting method for easily studying thermal environments and predicting the thermal comfort of an indoor space. Moreover, the representation of thermal indexes in colour maps is an informative approach, prompting recommendations and development actions with the aim of providing more comfortable, safer, and healthier work conditions, and minimizing occupational disorders. Indeed, the practical results were appreciated by the Health and Safety Department of each industry in order to develop measures that improve the occupational health of the occupants to prevent work accidents and work-related disorders. Accordingly, the methodology applied in this work, using a colour scale with the EsConTer index, proposes a new, simplified model for thermal stress risk evaluation, aiming to minimize difficult and time-consuming investigations to identify thermal comfort problems in workplaces. The coloured maps generated by MatLab algorithms proved to be a useful tool to visualize the thermal pattern of an environment, and consequently to identify thermal comfort problems...|$|E
