[...] My storyline has come to an end, but there is a good indication that the writers see my character coming back." [...] Elba made an appearance in [...] "Company Picnic", the fifth season finale. Elba said he did not watch [...] "Broke" [...] after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to torture myself." ...|$|E

After her performance, the singer was asked how she felt it went, saying she had [...] "forgotten what a crowd like that feels and looks like. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to get nervous – I don't like to think about things too much beforehand, otherwise I worry too much. I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E

And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations.

500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. I watch it and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure {{said there was a}} great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to move in that direction to demonstrate Pam was trying to figure out what she wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire.

500|$|... "Dream Team" [...] {{was written}} by B. J. Novak and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. It originally aired on April 9, 2009, {{the same day as}} the episode [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company"; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes. It marks the first appearance of Novak as Ryan since [...] "Frame Toby" [...] in November 2008, when Novak briefly left the show to film his role in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Mindy Kaling, an Office writer who also stars as Kelly Kapoor, thought of the idea of Ryan dying his hair blond. Novak wore a baseball cap in public between the times his hair was dyed and when the episode aired, {{in order to make the}} reveal a surprise, and even kept the cap on when he and the rest of the cast and crew did a public forum and Q session. [...] "Dream Team" [...] was the third of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from the television series The Wire.

It originally aired April 9, 2009, {{the same day as}} the episode [...] "Dream Team"; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes. [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] was the fourth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to torture myself." [...] According to the Season 5 DVD episode commentary, B. J. Novak came up with the story idea involving Jim and the [...] "run-down" [...] and worked it into Spitzer's final script. The episode included a new title sequence with footage of the series characters in the new Michael Scott Paper Company office setting, rather than the Dunder Mifflin setting from the previous episodes. Rainn Wilson and Ed Helms practiced the guitar competition in Ed Helms' trailer during lunch the day of the filming; Helms, a proficient bluegrass banjo player, coached Wilson, who is proficient at guitar and drums. Wilson said he proposed doing a full studio cover of the song, with Creed Bratton providing backup guitar and vocals, and selling it on iTunes for charity. Helms said he was happy {{to have the opportunity to}} play banjo on screen, but did not feel the instrument made much sense for his character; Helms said, [...] "It's so fun and weird, but he's a Connecticut preppy guy. How did he pick up a banjo? It's one of Andy's many mysteries, not all of which I even understand." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Boss" [...] {{was written}} by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. [...] "New Boss" [...] {{was the first of}} six episodes Idris Elba was set to guest star in as Charles, Michael's new Dunder Mifflin superior. It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, [...] "The creators of the show called me, said they wanted to put me in as this new character, that I’d be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I’m still playing the straight guy, but he’s kind of got a bit of a quirk to him." [...] The writing staff for The Office are fans of The Wire, and have referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said [...] "New Boss" [...] was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to torture myself." [...] Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him [...] "a really interesting and great foil for Michael". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be [...] "incredibly nice and incredibly funny".|$|E

[...] Shakira has frequently stated she is inspired by oriental music and Indian music, which influenced many of her earlier works. She has also been influenced by her Arabian heritage, which was a major inspiration for her breakthrough world hit [...] "Ojos Así". She told Portuguese TV, [...] "Many of my movements belong to Arab culture." [...] She also cites her parents as having been major contributors to her musical style. She is also strongly influenced by Andean music and South American folk music, using her native instrumentation for her Latin dance-pop songs.|$|E

That same year, Kung Lao's hat splice Fatality ranked as 35th most gruesome finishing move ever by UGO.com. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon commented that Kung Lao's MK2011 'buzzsaw-on-the-ground' was [...] "probably the most painful-looking Fatality ever made;" [...] it was included by FHM on their list of nine most brutal Fatalities in the game.
