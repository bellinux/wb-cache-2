However, these models preclude a "contagion-risk'' channel, where the aggregate corporate bond index reacts adversely to a credit event. In this paper, we propose a tractable model for pricing corporate bonds subject to contagion-risk. We show that when investors have fragile beliefs (Hansen and Sargent (2009)), contagion premia may be sizable even if P-measure contagion across defaults is small. We find {{empirical support for}} contagion in bond returns in response to large credit events. Model calibrations suggest that while contagion risk premia may be sizable, jump-to-default risk premia have an upper bound of a few basis points. ...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{is often}} used as a <b>default</b> <b>attribute</b> {{reflecting}} lack of {{clear understanding of the}} influence of new patterns and actors of structural change beyond states, firms and institutions traditionally involved in regulatory practices across nations. The article argues that the notion of hybrid has a distinct relevance for engaging shortcomings of global governance literature. It explores the lessons to be drawn from ancient mythology by highlighting that ontological ambiguity and emotional ambivalence represent core features of hybrid creatures. It then builds upon critical scholarship in global political economy to conceptualise three generic levels of transfers of authority at which situating the hybrid dimension of governance in contemporary capitalism. Following this approach, the concept of hybrid explicates the ambiguity between formal and informal transfers of authority, which in turn provides an insight into the contested nature of the procedures used to reinforce this type of governance practices...|$|E
50|$|Although W3C XML Schema's {{ability to}} add <b>default</b> <b>attributes</b> to {{elements}} is an advantage, it is a disadvantage {{in some ways}} as well. It means that an XML file may not be usable {{in the absence of}} its schema, even if the document would validate against that schema. In effect, all users of such an XML document must also implement the W3C XML Schema specification, thus ruling out minimalist or older XML parsers. It can also slow down processing of the document, as the processor must potentially download and process a second XML file (the schema); however, a schema would normally then be cached, so the cost comes only on the first use.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} interactive design tasks based on Relational Grammars. Relational Grammars extend traditional one-dimensional string languages to higher dimensions through user-supplied domain relations. Design support {{takes the form of}} graphic inferences on partial input during design interaction with the user. Because {{of the nature of the}} rule definitions, design elements can be roughly &quot;sketched &quot; without concern for their specific details. During the interaction process, the system installs constraints, adds <b>default</b> <b>attributes,</b> and/or builds higher-level composite structures out of the original input. An example scenario of the use of this formalism is presented supporting the task of document design. A general algorithm for the integration of grammarbased parsing in an interactive design environment is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{class of}} well-behaved {{evaluation}} functions simplifies and makes efficient {{the handling of}} numerical attributes; for them it suffices {{to concentrate on the}} boundary points in searching for the optimal partition. This holds always for binary partitions and also for multisplits if only the function is cumulative in addition to being well-behaved. The class of well-behaved eval-uation functions is a proper superclass of convex evaluation functions. Thus, {{a large proportion of the}} most important attribute evaluation functions are well-behaved. This paper explores the extent and boundaries of well-behaved func-tions. In particular, we examine C 4. 5 ’s <b>default</b> <b>attribute</b> evaluation function gain ratio, which has been known to have problems with numerical attributes. We show that gain ratio is not convex, but is still well-behaved with respect to binary partitioning. However, it cannot handle higher arity partitioning well. Our empirical experiments show that a very simple cumulative rectification to the poor bias of information gain significantly outperforms gain ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|In the much-debated {{domain of}} globalisation, most {{critical}} approaches in political economy deny a priori assumptions abaout {{the relative importance}} of state and markets, the public and the private spheres, the domestic and the transnational arenas. By considering their relationship as closely integrated, they explore social and historical practices that contribute to define these relationship, as well as structural constraints framing the capabilities of social change in contemporary capitalism. Recent scholarship has sought to broaden the scope of enquiry to include new patterns and agents of structural change beyond states, firms, and institutions traditionally involved in regulatory practices on a transnational basis. Hybrid is often used as a <b>default</b> <b>attribute</b> reflecting lack of clear understanding of the breadth of this new type of influence and the opacity of the means involved. The paper explains why the notion of hybrid is relevant in elucidating what is at stake in the devolution of power taking place in a wide array of practices related to global governance. Drawing on the insights of philology and mythology, it argues that {{the use of the word}} hybrid explicates the ontological ambiguity between imaginary and real aspects of globalisation. Furthermore, it specifies the categories involved in the analysis of emerging forms of hybrid regulatory practices. Recent scholarship on globalisation tends to focus on the private/public nexus of the subjects involved in new forms of institutional arrangements and authority. Here, subjects, objects and space are analysed as joint issues of regulatory practices...|$|E

Standards do not take into account spatial dimension of sound and assessments are limited to the overall quality particularly in the context of audio coding. Through different elicitation methods, a long list of attributes has been established to characterize sound but it is difficult to include them in a listening test. A previous study aimed at clustering attributes in families. Thus 3 families of attributes were highlighted, ''timbre", ''space" and ''defaults". The overall quality and these three families were evaluated in the listening test presented in this article. The test protocol was based on the Mushra recommendation. However it included three anchors specific to each attribute and no reference in order to evaluate quality instead of fidelity. The aim of the experiment described in this paper was to verify the influence of those 3 attributes on the overall quality in a 5. 1 reproduction system. It results that the <b>defaults</b> <b>attribute</b> has more influence on the overall quality than the timbre and the timbre. Moreover the presentation of the three attributes on the same interface adds no bias...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is to define the relevant areas of activities for teachers and other stakeholders involved in assuring quality in higher education of the Republic of Croatia and to establish the relevance of their inclusion into the research model. Individual areas of activity have been confirmed based on the opinions expressed by experts from relevant institutions in the Republic of Croatia. The authors used the budget allocation method to aggregate expert opinion, assign weights to variables and define the aggregate index. Bootstrap testing of the hypothesis of arithmetic mean justified the inclusion of relevant areas of HEI quality into the model: teaching (X 1), scientific research (X 2), professional engagement (X 3), participation in faculty and university bodies (X 4) and support service activities (X 5). Expert opinions have generated the following weights for individual quality areas: w 1 = 0. 42; w 2 = 0. 27; w 3 = 0. 14; w 4 = 0. 08; w 5 = 0. 09.

50|$|Like the BASIC {{programming}} language, Visual Basic {{was designed}} to accommodate a steep learning curve. Programmers can create both simple and complex GUI applications.Programming in VB {{is a combination of}} visually arranging components or controls on a form, specifying attributes and actions for those components, and writing additional lines of code for more functionality. Since VB defines <b>default</b> <b>attributes</b> and actions for the components, a programmer can develop a simple program without writing much code.Programs built with earlier versions suffered performance problems, but faster computers and native code compilation has made this less of an issue. Though VB programs can be compiled into native code executables from version 5 on, they still require the presence of around 1 MB of runtime libraries. Core runtime libraries are included by default in Windows 2000 and later, but extended runtime components still have to be installed. Earlier versions of Windows (95/98/NT), require that the runtime libraries be distributed with the executable.Forms are created using drag-and-drop techniques. A tool is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window). Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed by the programmer. Many attribute values can be modified during run time based on user actions or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application. For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.|$|R
