40|$|Scaffolds for {{engineering}} soft tissue would ideally be mechanically compliant and anisotropic while possessing inherent bioactivity and enzyme sensitivity {{similar to the}} native extracellular matrix. Biodegradable elastomers, such as cytocompatible poly(ester urethane) ureas, represent attractive alternatives to more common biodegradable polyesters utilized in tissue engineering. These materials can be processed by electrospinning into scaffolds suitable for in vivo placement and support of cellular adhesion and growth. This process, where an electric field overcomes surface tension to generate and draw nanoscale fibers, can create scaffolds with extracellular matrix-like morphologies that retain mechanical strength and flexibility while also permitting protein incorporation into spun fibers to impart bioactivity. Poly(ester urethane) urea (PEUU) was blended with collagen or urinary bladder matrix and processed with electrospinning into nanofibrous scaffolds. Protein incorporation into the matrices resulted in increased cellular adhesion and scaffold degradation rate. PEUU scaffolds were fabricated with various degrees of fiber alignment to more closely mimic soft tissue anisotropy {{such as that of}} the native pulmonary valve. The fabrication of mechanically anisotropic scaffolds is desired due to their ability to direct cell growth during tissue remodeling. PEUU <b>elastomeric</b> <b>matrices</b> could serve as mechanical support scaffolds for cell adhesion and growth but can require long seeding and culture times to achieve high density cellular in-growth. Therefore, a microintegration technique was developed where the elastomeric fibers are spun concurrently with electrospraying of cells.

The functionality of electrospun PEUU was evaluated for its ability to release bioactive basic fibroblast growth factor or the antibiotic tetracycline.

Three types of mold geometries have been used according to ASTM standards to fabricate the composites on the hot isostatic press to evaluate in-situ back-face temperature elevation, linear/radial ablation resistance, and mechanical properties. High temperature (≈ 3000 o Thermal stability and heat absorbing capability investigations {{have been carried out}} on the TG/DTA equipment. Mechanical properties have been executed using Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and rubber hardness tester. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with the energy dispersive spectroscopy was performed to demonstrate the reinforcement’s dispersion, interface quality, char morphology, char–reinforcement interaction, and compositional analysis of the composites. C) oxy–acetylene torch coupled with the temperature data logging system was used to execute the ablation measurements of the ablative composites. The ablation, thermal, and mechanical properties of the fabricated composites have been positively influenced with increasing the concentration of the nanoclays/synthetic fibers/nanotubes in the host rubber matrices. The least backface temperature evolution under 200 s flame exposure, best linear/radial/mass ablation resistance, and the utmost improvement in tensile strength and elongation at break have been observed for 30 wt% nanokaolinite and 7 wt% chopped Kevlar fiber impregnated ablative composites. High thermal stability, heat quenching capability, low thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and remarkable reinforcement–matrix adhesion are identified as the most prominent factors for enhanced ablation performance. The novelty of this research work is the fabrication of new ablative formulations with augmented ablation resistance (linear ablation rate of ~ 0. 002 mm/s) and back-face temperatures in the vicinity of 55 oC. This compares with the ablation rates of 0. 01 mm/s and back-face temperatures 130 o C for contemporary work using elastomeric composites under similar conditions.

40|$|International audienceElastomer {{filled with}} fibrous clay (sepiolite) was {{manufactured}} using a hydrophilic elastomer matrix, poly 2 -hydroxyethylacrylate (PHEA). The surface silanol groups located onto the channel {{sides of the}} sepiolite were functionalized with both octyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) and 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS), which form covalent bonds with the mineral surface and modify their properties. After the grafting of OTMS, PHEA is in contact with a non-polar chain, which prevents matrix-filler interactions. After the grafting of MPTMS, covalent bonds are formed between the acrylate groups of PHEA and MPTMS, which increase the matrix-filler interactions. After functionalization, there is {{no change in the}} structural and zeolitic water of the sepiolite which conserves its hydrophilic character. So, an equivalent distribution of the pristine and modified sepiolite is detected in the <b>elastomeric</b> <b>matrices</b> on transmission electron microscopy views of ultramicrotome cuts. The elastomeric macroscopic behavior is therefore related to the PHEA-sepiolite interactions. We show that the stronger the host-matrix interactions, the more important is the reinforcement effect.

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore how {{structural}} parameters of composites filled with one-dimensional, electrically conducting elements (such as sticks, needles, chains, or rods) affect the percolation properties of the system. To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of asymmetric two-dimensional stick systems with anisotropic alignments. We compute the percolation probability functions {{in the direction of}} preferential orientation of the percolating objects and in the orthogonal direction, as functions of the experimental structural parameters. Among these, we considered the average length of the sticks, the standard deviation of the length distribution, and the standard deviation of the angular distribution. We developed a computer algorithm capable of reproducing and verifying known theoretical results for isotropic networks and which allows us to go beyond and study anisotropic systems of experimental interest. Our research shows that the total electrical anisotropy, considered as a direct consequence of the percolation anisotropy, depends mainly on the standard deviation of the angular distribution and on the average length of the sticks. A conclusion of practical interest is that we find that there is a wide and well-defined range of values for the mentioned parameters for which it is possible to obtain reliable anisotropic percolation under relatively accessible experimental conditions when considering composites formed by dispersions of sticks, oriented in <b>elastomeric</b> <b>matrices.</b> Comment: 27 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

Moreover, the strain softening (Payne effect) of selected rubbers with 30 part per hundred rubber (phr) filler content was also investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) in shear mode.

On the other hand, JIc did not change with filler loading for the NR/organoclay systems that was traced to straininduced crystallization effect in NR. The tearing modulus (TJ) also increased with increasing filler loading. The related increase strongly depended on both rubber and filler types.
