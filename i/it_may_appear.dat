5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5â€“20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E

25|$|However {{plausible}} <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> {{at first}} sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of angular momentum; if the Sun had indeed formed from {{the collapse of}} such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly. The Sun, though it contains almost 99.9 percent of the system's mass, contains just 1 percent of its angular momentum. This means that the Sun should be spinning much more rapidly.|$|E
25|$|As the Sun {{crosses the}} sky, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to be red, orange, yellow or white, {{depending}} on its position. The changing {{color of the}} Sun {{over the course of}} the day is mainly a result of the scattering of light and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by Rayleigh scattering of the sunlight by the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.|$|E
25|$|Characterising by {{reference}} to the lex causae, the law that is identified {{in the choice of}} law stage of the conflict process as the one to be applied to determine the case, would be problematic. Although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> logical to allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument: the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae.|$|E

25|$|The hymen is a {{membrane}} {{of tissue}} that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal opening. The effects of vaginal intercourse and childbirth on the hymen are variable. If the hymen is sufficiently elastic, it may return to nearly its original condition. In other cases, {{there may be}} remnants (carunculae myrtiformes), or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> completely absent after repeated penetration. Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, medical examination, masturbation or physical exercise. For these reasons, {{it is not possible}} to definitively determine whether or not a girl or woman is a virgin by examining her hymen.|$|E
25|$|Dermatitis {{symptoms}} {{vary with}} all {{different forms of}} the condition. They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, {{the area of the}} skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum. Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, many {{companies}} in debt decide {{it is more}} beneficial to start again by creating a new company, {{often referred to as}} a phoenix company. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the company in liquidation without approval from the Court, they will be committing an offence under S216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions). Persons participating in the management of the 'phoenix' company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under s217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.|$|E

25|$|The {{motif of}} the hand, with no body attached, {{provides}} {{a problem for}} the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or {{near the top of the}} image, but in iconic contexts <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's wreath (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus (see below). Several of the examples in the Dura Europos synagogue (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.|$|E
25|$|The Klabautermann (also spelt Klaboterman and Klabotermann) is a {{creature}} from {{the beliefs of}} fishermen and sailors of Germany's north coast, the Netherlands, and the Baltic Sea, and may represent a third type of kobold or possibly a different spirit that has merged with kobold traditions. Belief in the Klabautermann dates to at least the 1770s. According to these traditions, Klabautermanns live on ships and are generally beneficial to the crew. For example, a Klabautermann will pump water from the hold, arrange cargo, and hammer at holes until they can be repaired. The creatures {{are thought to be}} especially useful in times of danger, preventing the ship from sinking. The Klabautermann is associated with the wood of the ship on which it lives. It enters the ship via the wood used to build it, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> as a ship's carpenter.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> as {{somewhat of a}} mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you donâ€™t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. Thatâ€™s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel thatâ€™s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, thatâ€™s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E
