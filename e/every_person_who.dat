5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

5|$|Managers in the Premier League are {{involved}} in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Paula's disappearance, there was no state police {{organization}} in Vermont, and the state's attorney, county sheriff and state investigator Almo Franzoni {{were responsible for the}} investigation. Paula's father pressed the investigators and the governor to bring in additional professional law enforcement help. Vermont's governor asked Connecticut's governor to lend assistance. Connecticut State Police detective Robert Rundle and state policewoman Dorothy Scoville were assigned to the case. They interviewed <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> saw, or thought they saw Paula, <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> lived along the route she took or who were simply {{in the vicinity of the}} Long Trail on that December afternoon.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> bears a clan's name is a lineal descendant of the chiefs. Many clansmen although {{not related to the}} chief took the chief's surname or a variant of it as their own to show solidarity, for basic protection or for much needed sustenance. Historian C.I Fraser of Reeling stated that the bond between clansman and chief cannot in every instance have been that of a common blood.|$|E
25|$|Organizers of the London Marathon, {{which was}} held six days after the Boston bombing, {{reviewed}} security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect {{for the victims of}} Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests.

My feeling is always that by getting that individual's story out, you can illuminate the lives of others and help them, but if you can't do something for that one person, then you're not ultimately {{going to be able to}} do much effectively for the 1,000, the 10,000, the million.|$|R
25|$|The {{denial of}} bail for Chung Yik-tin sparked {{controversy}} over the subjective application of the law. Legislator Ronny Tong accused the police of humiliating a suspect by their excessively hasty actions. The police's selectiveness in this case, as compared with previous cases of pornography distribution on the Internet, was also the focus of public attention. The local Chairman of the Internet Society and legislator Regina Ip {{said that it was}} inevitable that police would apply the law selectively, for it would be impractical to take action against <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had committed an offence in Hong Kong.|$|E

We wanted each and <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell. And we called it Thingy.|$|E
25|$|Slavery was {{introduced}} to Manhattan in 1626, {{but it was not}} until December 13, 1711, that the New York City Common Council made Wall Street the city's first official slave market for the sale and rental of enslaved Africans and Indians. The slave market operated from 1711 to 1762 at the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets. It was a wooden structure with a roof and open sides, although walls may have been added over the years and could hold approximately 50 men. The city directly benefited from the sale of slaves by implementing taxes on <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> was bought and sold there.|$|E

25|$|New star-shaped Christmas tree {{lights were}} used in 1935, but some were stolen the week after Christmas. To {{discourage}} future thefts, a temporary low octagonal fence was constructed around the 1936 tree. The method of lighting the tree also changed. The National Park Service history of the tree claims that in 1936 or 1937, the button used since 1925 {{was replaced by a}} switchbox. The Washington Post, however, indicates that the button was still used in 1936. The box was definitely in use by 1937. It was constructed and donated by the Electric Institute of Washington, and was engraved with the name of <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had lit the tree since 1923. In 1938, the Electric Institute of Washington donated mercury-vapor floodlights to the federal government, which were used to help illuminate the tree.|$|E
25|$|One such {{massacre}} {{occurred at}} Nyarubuye. On April 12, more than 1,500 Tutsis sought refuge in a Catholic church in Nyange, then in Kivumu commune. Local Interahamwe, acting {{in concert with}} the authorities, used bulldozers to knock down the church building. The militia used machetes and rifles to kill <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> tried to escape. Local priest Athanase Seromba was later found guilty and {{sentenced to life in prison}} by the ICTR for his role in the demolition of his church; he was convicted of the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. In another case, thousands sought refuge in the Official Technical School (École Technique Officielle) in Kigali where Belgian UNAMIR soldiers were stationed. On April 11, the Belgian soldiers withdrew, and Rwandan armed forces and militia killed all the Tutsi.|$|E
25|$|Franklin {{kicked his}} 100th {{goal for the}} home-and-away season against Carlton in round 22 at Etihad Stadium, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} kick 100 goals in a season since Tony Lockett in 1998, and the first Hawthorn player since Jason Dunstall in 1996. Upon reaching the milestone, thousands of supporters stormed the field and formed a large huddle around Franklin, who was promptly ushered from the field and into the change rooms until the supporters had cleared. Prior to the match, the AFL had warned of a $6000 fine for <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> jumped the fence. He also was the first player of Aboriginal descent to achieve this. He then added to his tally by kicking another eight goals in the qualifying final against the Western Bulldogs, equalling Dermott Brereton's record for the most goals kicked by a Hawthorn player in a finals match. He kicked just one goal against St Kilda in the preliminary final, before Hawthorn {{went on to win the}} premiership. Although Franklin did not play a large part in the grand final, his two goals brought his season tally up to 113 goals. Franklin was named as full forward in the 2008 All-Australian team, his first ever selection; he then received his first Peter Crimmins Medal for his outstanding season.|$|E

The duty also extends to those who have statutory powers to arrange for the provision of dwellings, and those who do so in the course of business.

[...] No other term is legally recognized {{for the purpose of}} registration and the term Indian specifically excludes reference to Inuit as per section 4 of the Indian Act(R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5). Indian remains in place as the legal term used in the Canadian Constitution. Its usage outside such situations can be considered offensive.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the script}} was finalized, Gilroy {{knew that he}} wanted to direct the film. He sent the script to his brother Tony Gilroy, and asked him for advice on directing.

The production crew included film editor John Gilroy, cinematographer Robert Elswit, and composer James Newton Howard. Gilroy previously met Elswit while working as a screenwriter for The Bourne Legacy (2012); the two formed a partnership, and created a shot-list for Nightcrawler months before filming. The production team needed licensed background footage for the newsroom scenes, and the Raishbrook brothers, three real stringers, offered their footage.
