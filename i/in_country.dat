40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} effects of various types of R&D on multi-factor productivity growth, which are the spillover effects of R&D activities. Econometric estimates are conducted on a panel of 16 OECD countries, over the period 1980 - 98. All results are averages over countries and time, and little can be said about country specificities. Major results are as follows: an increase of 1 per cent in business R&D generates 0. 13 per cent in productivity growth. The effect is larger <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> that are intensive in business R&D, and <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> where the share of defence-related government funding is lower; a 1 per cent increase in foreign R&D generates 0. 46 per cent in productivity growth, and the effect is larger <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> intensive <b>in</b> business R&D; 1 per cent more in public R&D generates 0. 17 per cent in productivity growth. The effect is larger <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> where the share of universities (as opposed to government labs) is higher, <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> where the share of defence R&D is lower, and <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> which are intensive in business R&D. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{corporate}} payout {{data from}} 33 economies, this study investigates {{the contribution of}} stock repurchases {{to the value of}} the firm and cash holdings in different country-level investor protection environments. We find that stock repurchases contribute more to firm value <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with strong investor protection than <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with weak investor protection. We also report that dividends contribute approximately 60 % more to firm value than repurchases <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with weak investor protection. Furthermore, as the proportion of repurchases in total payouts increases, the marginal value of cash increases <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with strong investor protection, whereas it declines <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with weak investor protection. In a poor investor protection environment, the marginal value of cash for a firm that makes 100 % of its payouts via repurchases is 12 cents lower than that for a firm that distributes 100 % of its payouts via dividends. Overall, our findings highlight that stock repurchases are less effective than dividends in mitigating agency problems associated with free cash flow <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with poor investor protection.

Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated.

40|$|In a new dataset of 1. 3 million firms {{from over}} 100 countries, I {{establish}} {{a number of}} regularities in cross-country differences in economic concentration. Concentration of sales and employment is substantially higher <b>in</b> smaller <b>countries</b> and <b>in</b> less-developed countries; these two factors alone explain roughly half the cross-country variation in concentration. Nevertheless, a number of institutional factors offer additional explanatory power for concentration. Concentration is higher <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with higher entry costs for new firms, <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with weaker antitrust policy, <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with less financial development, <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with weaker rule of law, and <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> with more burdensome regulation. Weak institutions are associated with higher concentration especially in industries {{that do not have}} naturally high levels of concentration. In addition, the relationships between institutions and concentration are more pronounced in nontradable and investment-intensive industries, suggesting that natural barriers to competition facilitate the monopolization of sectors especially when institutions are weak. ...|$|R
