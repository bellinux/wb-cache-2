5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{stars are}} {{inducted}} in an annual group ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts {{more than two}} major stars at a time. Celebrities can {{have more than one}} star on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive as many as five stars under the various categories. This does not <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included {{as part of a larger}} group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian Parliament gave 400,000 kroner {{in support}} in 1873, and doubled it the {{following}} year. By then, the Swedish authorities {{had decided that}} all railways should be built in standard gauge, and the Norwegian Parliament chose to change their configuration to the same gauge in 1874, increasing estimated costs from 4.7 to 8.9 million kroner. This was a similar arrangement to what would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the two international lines in Eastern Norway, where the Kongsvinger and Østfold Lines were also built with standard gauge. Despite intense lobbying from representatives from Innherred, the Verdal alternative was finally discarded when parliament gave 3 million kroner to the Meråker Line.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E

25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne. He said “We {{gave away}} the islands (in the Aegean) through the Treaty of Lausanne,”, “The islands, which if we care to shout (from the western Asia Minor coast) we’ll {{be heard on}} the other side (the islands), we gave away with Lausanne. What will now <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the {{continental}} shelf? What will <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E
25|$|The three {{visual effects}} above {{are the primary}} concern for {{aviation}} experts. This is because they could <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> lower-powered lasers that are commonly available.

25|$|Aerogels are {{produced}} by extracting the liquid component of a gel through supercritical drying. This allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary action, as would <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> conventional evaporation. The first aerogels were produced from silica gels. Kistler's later work involved aerogels based on alumina, chromia and tin dioxide. Carbon aerogels were first developed in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic.

Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by {{the sweetness of the}} dessert, this does not <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Madeira.|$|E
25|$|For practicality, {{usually only}} the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal {{greetings}} or in scientific papers indexing.
