2500|$|Tube sinking, {{also known}} as free tube drawing, reduces the {{diameter}} of the tube without a mandrel inside the tube. The inner diameter (ID) is determined by the inner and outer diameter of the stock tube, the outer diameter of the final product, the length of the die landing, the amount of back tension, and the friction between the tube and the die. This type of <b>drawing</b> <b>operation</b> is the most economical, especially on thick-walled tubes and tubes smaller than [...] in diameter, but does not give the best surface finish. As the tube thickness increases the surface finish quality decreases. This process is often used for the tubing on low-cost lawn furniture.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} model which predicts the {{feasibility}} of deep <b>drawing</b> <b>operations</b> of thin plates for various directions of solicitation. The first part consists of a theoretical presentation and a comparison of experimental results. The influence of anisotropic parameters and their implications for the surface stress criteria are then analysed. It is possible to predict the optimal direction of solicitation (in direct or broken path) to increase the strains during deep <b>drawing</b> <b>operations</b> by using this approach. Finally, we propose a modification of the model to improve understanding {{of the influence of}} rate strain on forming limit stress and strain diagrams...|$|R
5000|$|A {{software}} implementation of double buffering has all <b>drawing</b> <b>operations</b> store their results in some region of system RAM; any such region {{is often called}} a [...] "back buffer". When all <b>drawing</b> <b>operations</b> are considered complete, the whole region (or only the changed portion) is copied into the video RAM (the [...] "front buffer"); this copying is usually synchronized with the monitor's raster beam {{in order to avoid}} tearing. Double buffering necessarily requires more memory and CPU time than single buffering because of the system memory allocated for the back buffer, the time for the copy operation, and the time waiting for synchronization.|$|R

50|$|During any <b>drawing</b> <b>operation,</b> {{there is}} a source (the pixels being {{produced}} by the paint) and a destination (the pixels already onscreen). Normally, the source pixels simply overwrite the destination pixels, but the composite allows this behavior to be changed.|$|E

It reviews the result between mechanical and hydraulic presses and between SPCC (Cold rolled material) and SPHC (Hot rolled material) which are commonly used in automotive industry. The chosen of these two materials are because of its high usage in automotive industries in Malaysia. SPCC is most popular because of its attractive surface finished.

50|$|However, {{performing}} {{this entire}} sequence of steps for each <b>drawing</b> <b>operation</b> {{would be very}} inefficient. Java 2D therefore optimizes common drawing operations so {{that many of these}} steps can be skipped. If the paint is a simple solid color, for instance, {{there is no need to}} actually command it to generate a list of colors to be painted. Likewise, if the default fully opaque composite is in use, actually asking it to perform the compositing operation is unnecessary and would waste effort.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel hydro-mechanical {{deep drawing}} for {{magnesium}} alloy sheets at gradient temperature is proposed and studied. The novel process {{is on the}} basis of the study in sheet metal forming, the properties of magnesium alloy and the forming characteristics of workpiece in deep drawing. It indicates that the deep <b>drawing</b> <b>operation</b> of magnesium alloy sheet should be done in warm condition due to the poor plasticity of magnesium alloy. In addition, the reasonable temperature gradient of the workpiece is necessary in light on the principle of deep drawing. The essence why the limited drawing ratio can be improved with the new process is demonstrated. The reasonable temperature gradient can be obtained by the fluid pressure control during deep <b>drawing</b> <b>operation.</b> Thus the feasibility of the new technology is verified...|$|E

Using numerical simulation and experiments, the stress distribution was determined in the technological process of the first deep <b>drawing</b> <b>operation.</b> The numerical simulation was performed using the software Simufact and the stress was determined by applying deformation analysis.

40|$|Previous {{conceptual}} structure editors have focussed {{on providing}} specialised drawing tools.
