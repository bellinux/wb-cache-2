5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E

5000|$|That {{is often}} omitted when used to {{introduce}} a subordinate clause—"He told me that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] {{could just as easily}} be [...] "He told me <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] Historically, [...] "that" [...] usually followed a comma: [...] "He told me, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] Middle Modern English grammarian Joseph Robertson recommended in On Punctuation that <b>a</b> comma <b>be</b> used with <b>a</b> conjunction. However, if the subordinate, conjunctional ellipse, null complement, or syntactic pleonasm of [...] "that" [...] <b>is</b> punctuated with <b>a</b> comma, then, in the English grammar, stylistically speaking, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> comma splice, especially in formal writing. Instead, <b>a</b> semicolon should <b>be</b> used to be grammatically correct: He told me; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read. In grammar, the usage of [...] "that" [...] constitutes a that-clause while its absence constitutes a bare clause.|$|R
5|$|In about 50CE, a Roman vexillatio built a large timber {{fortress}} on {{a hilltop}} (near {{the site of}} the current church) at Letocetum. This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of governor Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defensive position, but the poor farmland surrounding the fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers. During the Neronian period this initial fortress was replaced with a smaller one and Letocetum then developed into a large-scale posting station. Most of the troops moved to the fortress at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58CE.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.|$|E
5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of {{what the rest of}} the season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E

5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic {{over the next few}} years.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> omen. He found {{the owners of the}} animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It {{had been}} two years since the Marcommani refused to help Roman {{against the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force {{into the heart of the}} Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra was {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer of the Regiment of Patricians created after the ill-fated British invasions of the Río de la Plata. The increased militarization {{of the city and}} the relaxation of the system of castas allowed him, as other criollo peoples, to become a prominent figure in local politics. His intervention was decisive to thwart the Mutiny of Álzaga and allow Viceroy Santiago de Liniers to stay in power. Although he supported the establishment of a government Junta, as others created in Spain during the contemporary Peninsular War, he desired that criollos had an important role in it (the mutiny of Álzaga was promoted by peninsulars). He advised against rushed actions as well, and as his Regiment was crucial in any action against the viceroy, he denied his help until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> strategic moment to do so. The opportunity came in May, 1810, and the May Revolution successfully ousted the viceroy.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E

Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic.

5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued that this was not the case. Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E
5|$|Maheshinte Prathikaaram {{is based}} on an {{incident}} in screenwriter Syam Pushkaran native village. During the filming of Aashiq Abu Idukki Gold (2013), Pushkaran discussed it with Abu's associate-director Dileesh Pothan, who decided to make his directorial debut with it. The idea for a film was developed; it was decided to set and shoot it in Idukki, since they believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> location for a story about people living in the countryside. In August 2014, Fahadh Faasil was reported to star in the film, with Abu bankrolling it through his production house OPM Dream Mill Cinemas. It was Faasil's second film for Abu after 22 Female Kottayam (2012). Bijibal was signed as the film's composer and Shyju Khalid as its cinematographer. Filming was planned to start {{in the first week of}} December 2014. Maheshinte Prathikaaram was Pushkaran's first independent screenplay. In September 2014, Faasil was reported to join the project after completing Anwar Rasheed's Maniyarayile Jinnu. Because of Faasil's scheduling conflicts, production was postponed until early June 2015. It was postponed again when the actor was unavailable due to a conflict with Naale and Ayal Njanalla. Maheshinte Prathikaaram began production in early August 2015 for a planned Christmas release.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As {{they did not want to}} keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E
