5|$|The iron {{industry}} was pursued by both private entrepreneurs who owned their own smelters {{as well as}} government-supervised smelting facilities. The Song economy was stable enough to produce over a <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> kilograms (over two <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> pounds) of iron product a year. Large-scale deforestation in China would have continued {{if not for the}} 11th-century innovation of the use of coal instead of charcoal in blast furnaces for smelting cast iron. Much of this iron was reserved for military use in crafting weapons and armouring troops, but some was used to fashion the many iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing domestic market. The iron trade within China was advanced by the construction of new canals, facilitating the flow of iron products from production centres to the large market in the capital city.|$|E

It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> years ago, California lay at {{the bottom}} of a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nora was {{the first}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to bring gale-force winds to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. In Mexico, Nora produced high waves, flooding, and heavy damage. Many homes were destroyed. In the United States, rains were heavy, and damage amounted to several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> dollars. Several hundred people were rendered homeless, and there was wind and flood damage in Arizona. Nora killed two people in Mexico, and several indirect deaths were reported in California.|$|E

5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> {{years later the}} proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> pounds of pizza cheese is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese used in the United States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E

There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate paléozoïc stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana. There is also bluish marl of the Turonian.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of this law is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred {{times larger than the}} average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E

In the course of these twenty years, the government borrowed near five <b>hundred</b> <b>millions</b> of real capital, for which on a rough average, exclusive of the sinking fund, it engaged to pay about five per cent. But if corn should fall to fifty shillings a quarter, and other commodities in proportion, instead of an interest of about five per cent. the government would really pay an interest of seven, eight, nine, and for the last two <b>hundred</b> <b>millions,</b> ten per cent.|$|R
