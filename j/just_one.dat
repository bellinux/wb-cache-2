5|$|Tessellations {{in three}} or more {{dimensions}} are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City were {{struggling}} in the Second Division {{at the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season.

Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or <b>just</b> <b>one.</b> When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or <b>just</b> <b>one</b> gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
