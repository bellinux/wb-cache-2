25|$|The {{electrical}} contacts may control the power directly (as {{in a household}} iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a relay or the supply of natural gas or fuel oil through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a thermocouple that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic <b>ignitor,</b> either a resistance heater or an electrically powered spark generating device.|$|E

25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (<b>Ignitor</b> built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results from a new {{diagnostic}} tool for investigating the efiects of ignition on the discharge symmetry in gas-fed pulsed plasma thrusters (GF-PPTs). Using a fast-framing camera, up to 16 indi-vidual pictures of a single GFPPT discharge can be captured at frequencies as high as 20 MHz. This high framing rate capability allows the discharge initiation and current sheet formation to be visualized with a large degree of temporal resolution. Varying the frame rate, number and size of pictures per discharge, {{as well as the}} trigger delay sent to the camera al-lowed multiple discharges at difierent stages to be vi-sualized. Various conflgurations of GFPPT electrode geometry and discharge ignition systems were pho-tographed in operation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate laser ignition using a diode laser for elastomer-modified cast double-base (EMCDB) propellant in order to develop more liable and greener laser <b>ignitors</b> for direct initiation of the propellant. Samples of the propellant were ignited using a 974 nm near-infrared diode laser. Laser beam parameters including laser power, beam width and pulse width were investigated to determine their effects on the ignition performance in terms of delay time, rise time and burn time of the propellant which was arranged in several different configurations. The results have shown that the smaller beam widths, longer pulse widths and higher laser powers resulted in shorter ignition delay times and overall burn times, however, there came a point at which increasing the amount of laser energy transferred to the material resulted in no significant reduction in either delay time or overall burn time. The propellant tested responded well to laser ignition, a discovery which supports continued research into the development of laser-based propellant <b>ignitors...</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{inductor}} {{attempts to}} maintain a constant current flow through it. If the current in the circuit in which the inductor is connected goes down for some reason, the voltage developed across the inductor will go up {{in an attempt to}} try to maintain the constant current. When used with an <b>ignitor</b> ignition system in an engine, there is current flow when the <b>ignitor</b> contacts are closed. When the <b>ignitor</b> contacts are opened by the mechanical parts of the engine, current flow is interrupted. Because the low tension coil wants to maintain that current flow, the voltage across the coil rapidly goes up (usually to several hundred volts). When the voltage rises high enough, the voltage will jump the still very small gap of the <b>ignitor</b> contacts and create a spark which ignites the fuel mixture in the engine. Since there is a finite amount of energy stored in the coil, as soon as the spark jumps the gap the voltage across the coil collapses. As soon as the engine rotates and the <b>ignitor</b> contacts again close, current starts to flow through the coil and it again stores energy for the next cycle.

40|$|The {{concern of}} an {{overpressure}} condition on the aft {{end of the}} Space Shuttle caused by ignition of unburned hydrogen being trapped in the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust duct at the Vandenberg AFB launch complex has been investigated for fifteen months. Approximately twenty-five concepts have been reviewed, with four concepts being thoroughly investigated. The four concepts investigated were hydrogen burnoff <b>ignitors</b> (<b>ignitors</b> located throughout the exhaust duct to continuously ignite any unburned hydrogen), jet mixing (utilizing large volumes of high pressure air to ensure complete combustion of the hydrogen), steam inert (utilizing flashing hot water to inert the duct with steam) and open duct concept (design an open duct or above grade J-deflector to avoid trapping hydrogen gas). Extensive studies, analyses and testing were performed at six test sites with technical support from twenty-two major organizations.
