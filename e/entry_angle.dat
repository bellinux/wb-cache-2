This work is of importance for understanding reservoir dynamics so that water quality can be maintained. The fluid {{is assumed to be}} of finite depth and the incoming channel makes an angle with the horizontal axis. The problem is formulated using conformal mapping and integral equation techniques and the resulting problem is solved using a surface angle approach. The shape of the interface is computed for a range of <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> and flow rates. Exact solutions are presented at a high flow rate and compared with the solutions to the nonlinear problem. These results have appeared in [1]. Solutions with waves are shown to exist on the interface at small flow rate and these are computed at very small <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> using a physical plane method. The case in which the lake or the reservoir is stratified in density is also considered and the separation height is determined for different values of the stratification.

40|$|Background Implanting large {{appliances}} {{into the}} heart, such as investi-gational transcatheter mitral or aortic valves, will require large introducer sheaths. Transfemoral arterial access {{may be limited}} by vessel caliber or disease [1]; transvascular retrograde aortic access risks atheroembolism and stroke [2]. Minithoracotomy access to the left ventricular (LV) apex [3, 4] or ascending aorta [5] provides a “straight shot” for large rigid devices, but requires surgical repair. Trans-catheter access across the interatrial septum creates un-favorable <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> and working space [6, 7].

40|$|A {{new type}} of cosmic {{spherule}} is reported with textures suggesting settling of olivine during atmospheric deceleration. Numerical simulations of entry heating reveal that relict forsterite, which survives melting, can settle over the 1 - 2 s of flight at high <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> and <b>entry</b> velocities up to 16 km s- 1.

40|$|Methods of {{controlling}} the trajectories of high-drag-low-lift vehicles entering the earth's atmosphere at angles of attack near 90 deg and at initial <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> up to 3 deg are studied. The trajectories are calculated for vehicles whose angle of attack can be held constant at some specified value or can be perfectly controlled {{as a function of}} some measured quantity along the trajectory. The results might be applied in the design of automatic control systems or in the design of instruments which will give the human pilot sufficient information to control his trajectory properly during an atmospheric entry. Trajectory data are compared {{on the basis of the}} deceleration, range, angle of attack, and, in some cases, the rate of descent. The aerodynamic heat-transfer rate and skin temperature of a vehicle with a simple heat-sink type of structure are calculated for trajectories made with several types of control functions. For the range of <b>entry</b> <b>angles</b> considered, it is found that the angle of attack can be controlled to restrict the deceleration down to an arbitrarily chosen level of 3 g. All the control functions tried are successful in reducing the maximum deceleration to the desired level. However, in order to avoid a tendency for the deceleration to reach an initial peak decrease, and then reach a second peak, some anticipation is required in the control function so that the change in angle of attack will lead the change in deceleration. When the angle of attack is controlled in the aforementioned manner, the maximum rate of aerodynamic heat transfer to the skin is reduced, the maximum skin temperature of the vehicle is virtually unaffected, and the total heat absorbed is slightly increased. The increase in total heat can be minimized, however, by maintaining the maximum desired deceleration for as much of the trajectory as possible. From an initial angle of attack of 90 deg, the angle-of-attack requirements necessary to maintain constant values of deceleration (1 g to 4 g) and constant values of rate of descent (450 to 1, 130 ft/sec) as long as it is aerodynamically practical are calculated and are found to be moderate in both magnitude and rate.

A detailed LDA experimental study is reported on the effect of variations in feed annulus conditions on port flow jet characteristics. The data are relevant to primary and dilution jet flows as found in gas-turbine combustor liners. Alteration of jet velocity ratios and associated bleed flows past the jet ports for a typical annulus height/port diameter configuration was observed to produce significant variations in separation regions in the annulus, distortions in downstream annulus profiles, and jet exit conditions. Profiles of jet exit velocity, flow angle, and turbulent kinetic energy distribution have been provided which should prove invaluable as boundary conditions for related CFD studies.
