5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms {{have very little}} color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
25|$|In a {{homogeneous}} specimen, {{there is no}} difference between the two beams, and no contrast is being generated. However, near a refractive boundary (say a nucleus within the cytoplasm), the difference between the ordinary and the extraordinary beam will generate a relief in the image. <b>Differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> requires a polarized light source to function; two polarizing filters have to be fitted in the light path, one below the condenser (the polarizer), and the other above the objective (the analyzer).|$|E
25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
40|$|Proteins of the B-cell {{lymphoma}} 2 {{family are}} {{crucial for the}} regulation of apoptosis. B-cell lymphoma 2 -associated X is a pro-apoptotic protein, while B-cell lymphoma 2 protein opposes apoptosis. The influence of 1 &# 956;M 2 -methoxyestradiol was investigated on the expression levels of these two proteins in MCF- 7 cells. 2 -Methoxyestradiol exposure did not influence B-cell lymphoma 2 protein expression levels after 24 h of exposure. In contrast, B-cell lymphoma 2 -associated X protein levels were significantly reduced. An improved <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrasting</b> technique revealed compromised cell density {{and the presence of}} a mitotic block in exposed cells. The study proposes that the influence of 2 -methoxyestradiol on the expression of these proteins may be time- and cell type dependent and thus not evident during the mitotic block observed. Investigation of the regulation of the B-cell lymphoma 2 family will allow researchers to consider signaling pathways for diseases where apoptosis can potentially be controlled...|$|R
40|$|Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) can {{emulate the}} classic {{microscopy}} techniques, including <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> (DIC) <b>contrast</b> and (spiral) phase contrast. Their programmability entails {{the benefit of}} flexibility or the option to multiplex images, for single-shot quantitative imaging or for simultaneous multi-plane imaging (depth-of-field multiplexing). We report {{the development of a}} microscope sharing many of the previously demonstrated capabilities, within a holographic implementation of a stereo microscope. Furthermore, we use the SLM to combine stereo microscopy with a refocusing filter and with a darkfield filter. The instrument is built around a custom inverted microscope and equipped with an SLM which gives various imaging modes laterally displaced on the same camera chip. In addition, there is a wide angle camera for visualisation of a larger region of the sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare two different methods of evaluating bull sperm morphology, bright-field (BF) microscopy of eosin–nigrosin (EN) stained dry-mount semen smears and <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> phase <b>contrast</b> (DIC) microscopy of wet-mount semen 'fixed' in isotonic formal saline, both at 1000 ×. Ejaculates (n = 72) were evaluated, representing both pre- and post-breeding season ejaculates collected from 40 2 -yr-old beef bulls via electro-ejaculation. For both methods, 200 sperm were counted in random fields with defects categorized as major (MAD) and minor (MID). Sperm abnormalities were also placed into two other categories: those considered to be most influenced by process (wet or dry, METHDEF) and those with depictions that could be influenced by optics (BF or DIC, OPTIDEF). Differences (P 0. 05) in percent normal sperm 69. 1 / 70. 4 or sperm head defects 7. 5 / 8. 3. Acrosome, tail and droplet defects were observed in 98. 2 / 80. 5, 86. 1 / 100 and 98. 2 / 94. 4 percent of bulls for DIC and BF, respectively (P < 0. 05). As percent normal sperm did not differ between methods, bright-field microscopy assessment of EN preparations was considered to be a satisfactory method to categorize breeding soundness of bulls. However, DIC was more effective in visualizing major defects, while BF (which included stained smear preparation) was considered to cause more minor defects. Thus DIC was considered to be the preferred method of semen assessment for accurate assessment of sperm morphology in bulls...|$|R
25|$|A Wollaston prism {{is another}} {{birefringent}} polarizer {{consisting of two}} triangular calcite prisms with orthogonal crystal axes that are cemented together. At the internal interface, an unpolarized beam splits into two linearly polarized rays which leave the prism at a divergence angle of 15°–45°. The Rochon and Sénarmont prisms are similar, but use different optical axis orientations in the two prisms. The Sénarmont prism is air spaced, unlike the Wollaston and Rochon prisms. These prisms truly split the beam into two fully polarized beams with perpendicular polarizations. The Nomarski prism is {{a variant of the}} Wollaston prism, which is widely used in <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> microscopy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, <b>differential</b> <b>interference</b> <b>contrast,</b> epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it was {{demonstrated}} using in vitro assays that the avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum {{is able to}} invade nonphagocytic cells. It was also shown that this mycoplasma can survive and multiply intracellularly for at least 48 h and that this cell invasion capacity contributes to the systemic spread of M. gallisepticum from the respiratory tract to the inner organs. Using the gentamicin invasion assay and a differential immunofluorescence technique combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy, {{we were able to}} demonstrate in in vitro experiments that M. gallisepticum is also capable of invading sheep and chicken erythrocytes. The frequencies of invasion of three well-defined M. gallisepticum strains were examined over a period of 24 h, and a significant increase in invasiveness occurred after 8 h of infection. In addition, blood samples derived from chickens experimentally infected via the aerosol route with the virulent strain M. gallisepticum Rlow were analyzed. Surprisingly, M. gallisepticum Rlow was detected in the bloodstream of infected chickens by nested PCR, as well as by <b>differential</b> immunofluorescence and <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> microscopy that showed that mycoplasmas were not only on the surface but also inside chicken erythrocytes. This finding provides novel insight into the pathomechanism of M. gallisepticum and may have implications for the development of preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus {{is a giant}} {{double-stranded}} DNA virus {{defining a}} new genus, the Mimiviridae, among the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV). We used utrastructural studies {{to shed light on}} the different steps of the Mimivirus replication cycle: entry via phagocytosis, release of viral DNA into the cell cytoplasm through fusion of viral and vacuolar membranes, and finally viral morphogenesis in an extraordinary giant cytoplasmic virus factory (VF). Fluorescent staining of the AT-rich Mimivirus DNA showed that it enters the host nucleus prior to the generation of a cytoplasmic independent replication centre that forms the core of the VF. Assembly and filling of viral capsids were observed within the replication centre, before release into the cell cytoplasm where progeny virions accumulated. 3 D reconstruction from fluorescent and <b>differential</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>interference</b> images revealed the VF emerging from the cell surface as a volcano-like structure. Its size dramatically grew during the 24 h infectious lytic cycle. Our results showed that Mimivirus replication is an extremely efficient process that results from a rapid takeover of cellular machinery, and takes place in a unique and autonomous giant assembly centre, leading to the release {{of a large number of}} complex virions through amoebal lysis...|$|R

40|$|Multi-Beam-Interference (MBI) is a {{promising}} approach for the direct nano structuring of surfaces. An important characteristic of MBI is the <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> which describes the modulation {{depth of the}} intensity distribution. While theoretical calculation for the <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> exists in literature, no actual measurement in experiments is documented. In this paper we present a method for determining the <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> by measuring the virtual shift of the ablation threshold. This virtual shift {{is caused by the}} modified intensity distribution via interference. At first, the theoretical basis for the measuring method is introduced, secondly the method is tested with a two beam interference setup used for direct structuring of surfaces.
