5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There {{was a change}} from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Karl was a late-season {{and unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. A minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, Karl {{developed at the}} center of another, larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic. After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> independent of its parent storm and grew into a full-fledged hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the United States' Civil War, Catholicism grew {{slowly in}} America, but afterward, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{widespread}} as Catholic immigrants from eastern Europe {{moved to the}} four counties, which include Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana, and Westmoreland, to mine coal and produce coke to fire steel mills in Pittsburgh. This influx of Catholic immigrants resulted {{in the creation of}} more than 80 parishes and missions in the counties between 1865 and 1917.|$|E

5|$|The Senne/Zenne (French/Dutch) was {{historically}} {{the main}} waterway of Brussels, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> polluted and less navigable {{as the city}} grew.

It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{of a museum}} from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E
5|$|The {{houses of}} medieval peasants were of poor quality {{compared}} to modern houses. The floor was normally of earth, {{and there was}} very little ventilation or sources of light in the form of windows. In addition to the human inhabitants, a number of livestock animals would also reside in the house. Towards the end of the medieval period, however, conditions generally improved. Peasant houses became larger in size, and <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> common to have two rooms, and even a second floor.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s the Auxois reached {{the peak of}} its {{physical}} development. It was described, like the Ardennais and the Trait du Nord, as a born plowhorse, with a neck naturally held so low that the nose almost touched the ground. It was developed entirely for traction, and its conformation allowed it to move huge weights over short distances. At the same time, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> popular than the Nivernais, and was considered a southern representation of the Ardennais breed. Merchants visiting Burgandy horse fairs appreciated the breed, and deemed its bay coloration better able to hide dirt {{than that of the}} light gray Percheron or black Nivernais. The peak populations and usage of the Auxois and other French draft horses was short due to the advent of mechanization in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have factored into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E

5|$|The route {{remained}} unchanged {{until the early}} 1960s, when several highways were renumbered. Highway19 between Woodstock and Shakespeare was redesignated as Highway59, while Highway 100 between Thamesford and St. Marys was redesignated as Highway19. The concurrencies with Highway2 and Highway7 were relocated {{as a result of}} this renumbering; Highway19 became concurrent with Highway2 between Ingersoll and Thamesford, and with Highway7 between St. Marys and Stratford. While the length of the route was reduced insignificantly {{as a result of this}} renumbering, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> direct.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|The square was {{originally}} a gentrified residential area, with tenants including Frederick, Prince of Wales and artists William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> down-market {{in the late}} 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place, becoming a centre for entertainment. Several major theatres were established in the 19th century, which were converted to cinemas towards {{the middle of the}} next. Leicester Square holds a number of nationally important cinemas such as the Odeon Leicester Square, Empire, Leicester Square and the now closed Odeon West End, which are frequently used for film premieres, The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is popular for showing cult films and marathon film runs. The square remains a popular tourist attraction, including hosting events for the Chinese New Year.|$|E
