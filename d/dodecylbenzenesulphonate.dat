Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl 3 - 6 H 20) and anhydrous iron (III) chloride (FeCl 3) were used to intercalate graphite powder. Detergents containing <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (C 12 H 25 C 6 H 4 SO 3) was reacted with the iron (III) chloride in order to intercalate a large molecule in-between the layers of graphite.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of different types}} of surfactants on ultrafiltration membranes has been investigated. A basic approach to membrane-surfactant interactions is also presented. A nonionic (Triton X- 100), two anionic (potassium oleate and sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate)</b> and a cationic (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) surfactant were investigated. The effects on commercial membranes of polysulphone, poly(vinylidene fluoride) and cellulose acetate were studied. The flux reductions of the hydrophobic membranes were found to be much more pronounced than the flux variations of the hydrophilic membranes. Both the material and the molecular weight cut-off were found to influence the performance of the hydrophobic membranes. A drastic {{influence of}} hydrophobic impurities was demonstrated. The retention of the nonionic surfactant was low at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. The retention of the ionic surfactants was quite high, even at low concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{oxidation}} {{of sodium}} <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (SDBS), cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and oleic acid {{has been studied}} at platinum (Pt) and Co(OH) 2 modified platinum (Pt/Co(OH) 2) electrode. Two methods, namely, cyclic voltammetry and constant current electrolysis {{have been used in}} this study. It was found that the electrochemical oxidation of the compounds studied was best conducted in KOH supporting electrolyte. The oxidation current of each compound studied at Pt/Co(OH) 2 was higher than that at Pt electrode, and percent yield of CO 2 produced from constant current oxidation of each compound studied at Pt/Co(OH) 2 electrode was higher than that at Pt electrode showing that electrocatalytic oxidation of the compounds studied was occurred at Pt/Co(OH) 2 electrode. The results suggests that the Pt/Co(OH) 2 electrode could be used for fatty acid and surfactant destruction in polluted water...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{effects of}} sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (SDBS) and hexamethylenetetramine (HA) on the corrosion of mild steel in sulphuric acid solution {{have been studied}} using weight loss, electrochemical impedance and Tafel polarisation measurements. For HA, a monotonous increase in inhibition efficiency is observed {{as a function of}} concentration. For SDBS, however, an optimum in the inhibition efficiency is observed for a concentration close to 250 ppm, which is ascribed to the formation of hemi-micellar aggregates that provoke inhibitor desorption from the metal/solution interface. at higher concentrations. Upon mixing HA and SDBS, concentration regions showing synergistic and antagonistic inhibition behaviour are identified, and it is concluded that electrostatic interactions between adsorbate ions are likely responsible for both phenomena. Langmuir and Frumkin isotherms were tested for relevance in describing the adsorption behaviour of both HA and SDBS. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} (adsorption) of the anionic surfactant, sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (SDBS), at air-liquid {{and different}} (octadecanethiol, β-mercaptoethanol, α-lipoic acid) solid-liquid interfaces from aqueous solutions containing {{high concentrations of}} counter-ion has been investigated. SDBS adsorption at the solid-liquid interfaces was obtained using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) while its adsorption at the air-liquid interface was extracted from surface tension measurements. The results have demonstrated that SDBS packing at the air-liquid interface is similar to its packing at the hydrophobic octadecanethiol-liquid interface. Additionally, SDBS packing at the three solid-liquid interfaces increases with increasing surface hydrophobicity, irrespective whether the surface is neutral or negatively charged. Nonetheless, SDBS adsorption is always within monolayer coverage (no evidence of bilayer or admicelle formation). The results have also revealed that SDBS affinity for the solid-liquid interfaces increases with increasing surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, SDBS affinity for the air-liquid interface is more than 10 -fold its affinity for the solid-liquid interfaces. Scopu...|$|E
40|$|Preparation of TiO 2 nano―particles with {{controllable}} surface {{charges for}} electrophoretic display {{was investigated in}} ethylene tetrachloride, Isopar H and dodecylbenzene, in which TiO 2 nano―particles were modified by anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and polymers, respectively. The research results showed that TiO 2 nano―particles modified by cationic surfactants had negative charges in ethylene tetrachloride, while it had positive charges in Isopar H and dodecylbenzene, the nano―particles modified by anionic surfactants had the opposite character. The influence of concentration of charge control agents on TiO 2 nano―particles surface charges was discussed, in which TiO 2 nano―particles were modified by sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate,</b> hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and styrene/divinylbenzene, respectively. It was shown that &xi; potential of TiO 2 nano―particles had a minimum value near the critical micelle concentrations of the charge control agents, and a regular change with the increasing concentration, while the property of &xi; potential was still maintained. So, preparation of controllable surface charges of TiO 2 nano―particles can be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|Chlorophyll-protein-detergent {{complexes}} {{were prepared}} from pea chloroplasts by using sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Circular-dichroism spectra showed that complex CPI has a dimeric arrangement of chlorophyll a, with additional weaker interactions. Ellipticities were determined for both complexes and for purified chlorophylls in solution, {{and it is}} argued that the circular dichroism of complex CPII is derived from chlorophyll-protein interaction rather than from interaction between chlorophylls a and b. The detergent could be removed from the complexes by using urea and gel filtration, leaving the chlorophyll-protein in solution, although in each case a diminished ellipticity indicated some loss of organization. Three-peaked circular-dichroism spectra of chloroplast fragments before and after addition of detergent were compared with a curve obtained by summing graphically the spectra of complexes CPI, CPII and the free-pigment fraction. There was good correspondence at 650 nm, and the longer-wavelength peaks agreed in form and magnitude, but with discrepancies in position. It was concluded that complexes CPI and CPII pre-exist in the original material, but that there is an environmental effect which is destroyed when the complexes are extracted...|$|E

It 9 ̆ 2 s found the polycarboxylate surfactant of SMA (styrene-maleic anhydride) {{is better than the}} monomolecule sulfate surfactant of SDBS (<b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate)</b> in the emulsification of Epoxy E- 51, because the microcapsules from epoxy E- 51 /SMA emulsion possess good sphericity and clear surface. On the second step of reaction, U/F mole ratio should be controlled in 1. 5 2 : 1 region, and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) or m-dihydroxybenzene are strongly recommended to be added to strengthen the shell. For a higher encapsulation ratio, acidification time should be controlled in 2 3 h and the end-point pH value of the curing reaction should be controlled at 2 2. 5, respectively.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of surfactin, a lipopeptide biosurfactant, at the liquid–air interface {{has been}} investigated in this work. The maximum adsorption density and the nature {{and the extent of}} lateral interaction between the adsorbed surfactin molecules at the interface were estimated from surface tension data using the Frumkin model. The quantitative information obtained using the Frumkin model was also compared to those obtained using the Gibbs equation and the Langmuir–Szyszkowski model. Error analysis showed a better agreement between the experimental and the calculated values using the Frumkin model relative to the other two models. The adsorption of surfactin at the liquid–air interface was also compared to those of synthetic anionic, sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (SDBS), and nonionic, octaethylene glycol monotetradecyl ether (C 14 E 8), surfactants. It has been estimated that the area occupied by a surfactin molecule at the interface is about 3 - and 2. 5 -fold higher than those occupied by SDBS and C 14 E 8 molecules, respectively. The interaction between the adsorbed molecules of the anionic biosurfactant (surfactin) was estimated to be attractive, unlike the mild repulsive interaction between the adsorbed SDBS molecules...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of wormlike micelle {{and the following}} significant changes in rheological properties suffer misunderstanding from both theoretical and fundamental aspects. Recently, we have introduced a theory for interpreting such important phenomenon which {{is referred to as}} critical intermolecular forces (CIF). The theory has stated that the hydrophobic effect is the main factor for the {{formation of}} worm-like aggregates. Therefore, it seems interesting to check out the validity of this new physical insight through investigating the presence of benzene ring as less hydrophobic group in contrast to that of alkyl in surfactant tail. The mixture of anionic sodium <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (SDBS) and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) shows a high dynamic viscosity peak at the ratio of 80 / 20 of 3 wt. % CTAB/SDBS indicating the formation of wormlike micelles. The thermodynamic properties have been evaluated for this mixture exhibiting good agreement with the rheological changes. Interestingly, the results show the presence of benzene ring (in SDBS) causing a negative effect towards the formation of one dimensional aggregate in contrast to previous results which support the proposed CIF theory. The presence of nonionic surfactant TritonX- 100 in binary and ternary systems of SDBS and CTAB prohibits the formation of wormlike micelles...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to develop an SO 2 sensor based upon a {{conducting}} polymer. The methodology and properties of a conducting polymer sensor along with the electrochemical characterisation of various polypyrrole layers is described. It was found that polypyrrole layers containing Copper (11) Phthalocyanine - 3, 4 ', 4 ", 4 "'-tetrasulphonate anions (PPTSP), as the dopant, upon electrochemical switching exhibit cation movement {{in and out of}} the polymer matrix. A concentration, pH, temperature and scan rate study was performed on the process of cation movement. Also anions, such as CIO 4 ", <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonate</b> (DBS) were employed as the dopants within the polypyrrole matrix. In this work it is described that the low level of non-faradaic current, characteristic of PPDBS layers, was due to the presence of the DBS anion in solution rather than the polymer morphology. Differential Pulse Voltammetry is applied to various polypyrrole layers and sigmoidal differential current outputs were obtained. A model is proposed for this behaviour which includes a set of resistances in parallel. Potential Step experiments were also performed on the polypyrrole layers. A transmission line model is proposed to explain the behaviour of the polymer film. For several electroconducting polymers spectroelectrochemical studies were carried out. The absorption spectra are quantitatively analysed using the Nemst equation by a 'Monomer Unit Model. The reaction between pyrrole and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was studied electrochemically and spectroscopically. It was found that TCNE forms a charge transfer complex with pyrrole, and it is present within the PPTCNE layer as the dopant anion. The influence of solvent composition upon the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide system was investigated electrochemically. It was found that in organic solvents ferrocyanide is a strong reducing agent. Polypyrrole layers were deposited across interdigital array electrodes and their responses to various organic vapours and 5...|$|E
