2500|$|Mrs. Ruth Cheney Streeter {{was named}} the first {{director}} of the WR; commissioned a major and sworn in by the Secretary of the Navy on 29January 1943. A year later, Streeter was promoted to colonel. She {{was not the first}} woman to see active duty in the Marine Corps during World WarII. Weeks earlier, Mrs. Anne A. Lentz, a civilian clothing expert who had helped design the WR uniforms, was commissioned a captain. Lentz came to the corps on a 30-day assignment from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) and stayed on. Streeter was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1895 and attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. She was the wife of a prominent (Morristown, NJ) lawyer and businessman, and the mother of four children, three sons, [...] in the military during World WarII, and one younger daughter. Although Streeter had 20 years of active civic work, she had never held a paying job. She was selected from a field of twelve outstanding women, all recommended to the corps by Dean Virginia C. Gildersleeve of Barnard College, who had earlier recommended Mildred McAfee for the director of the WAVES, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services. Streeter was 47 years of age when selected to head the WR. She was described as confident, spirited, patriotic, and a principled person, all qualities she had demonstrated. In 1940 she believed the United States would be drawn into World WarII. Intending {{to be part of the}} war effort, Streeter had learned to fly, earning a commercial pilots license and purchasing a small airplane, and in the summer of 1941, she joined the Civil Air Patrol. Although her plane was used to fly missions, she was, unhappily, relegated to doing … [...] "all the dirty work". Then, when the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) was formed, Streeter was twelve years over the age limit, but applied five times and was rejected five times. In January 1943, when she inquired about service with the WAVES, she was told that flying was out of the question but that she could be a <b>ground</b> <b>instructor.</b> Streeter turned it down, and a month later became the director of the WR. During her tenure as the director, she sent an open letter to all women recruits, saying, [...] "It is not easy to Free a Marine to Fight (a recruiting slogan of the WR). It takes couragethe courage to embark on a new and an alien way of life…. Your spirit is a source of constant inspiration to all who work with you." [...] Colonel Streeter resigned her commission from the WR on 7December 1945. (She was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Katherine A. Towle.) A few months later, the Marine Corps presented her with the Legion of Merit. It was the highest award ever made to a woman marine as a result of World WarII service. The Marine Corps also dedicated the headquarters building of the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Paris Island, South Carolina, to her. Ruth Cheney Streeter died on 9September 1990, two days before her 95th birthday.|$|E
