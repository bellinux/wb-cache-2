40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the rise in inflation rate in Indonesia {{during the height of}} the 1997 financial crisis was among the sharpest that the East Asian economies has ever witnessed in the recent decades. This paper empirically tests the monetary hypotheses of inflation and compares and contrasts the sources of price changes during the pre- and post- 1997 financial crisis. We find a high explanatory power of the monetary model for the post-crisis period, but not for the pre-crisis. The high volatilities of the local currency and the unprecedented rapid growth rate of base money during the post-crisis are found to be the two key monetary determinants of the inflation in the country. <b>Inflation,</b> <b>Base</b> Money, Expected Depreciation, Exchange Rate Policy, East Asian Financial Crisis...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of studies done on the recent East Asian crisis, hardly any of them has however {{simultaneously}} evaluated the roots of the inflationary pressures and unearthed the sources of sharp variations between the inflation rates of the various crisis-effected economies. To help fill in this gap, our paper examines and contrasts the sources of inflation in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea during the period of 1985 to 2001. A number of potential sources of inflation will be considered in the study. But this study pays a particular attention to the possible roles of the monetary aggregates and the exchange rate uncertainties in encapsulating the rise in the inflationary pressures and the variations between the inflation rates experienced by these economies during the 1997 crisis. <b>Inflation,</b> <b>Base</b> Money, Expected Depreciation, Exchange Rate Policy, East Asian Financial Crisis...|$|E

40|$|Models of large-field <b>inflation</b> <b>based</b> on axion-like {{fields with}} shift symmetries can be simple and natural, {{and make a}} {{promising}} prediction of detectable primordial gravitational waves. The Weak Gravity Conjecture is known to constrain the simplest {{case in which a}} single compact axion descends from a gauge field in an extra dimension. We argue that the Weak Gravity Conjecture also constrains a variety of theories of multiple compact axions including N-flation and some alignment models. We show that other alignment models entail surprising consequences for how the mass spectrum of the theory varies across the axion moduli space, and hence can be excluded if further conjectures hold. In every case that we consider, plausible assumptions lead to field ranges that cannot be parametrically larger than the Planck scale. Our results are strongly suggestive of a general inconsistency in models of large-field <b>inflation</b> <b>based</b> on compact axions, and possibly of a more general principle forbidding super-Planckian field ranges.

40|$|Consumer {{price index}} {{is a measure}} of {{inflation}} and it consists of two parts: persistent component (trend inflation) and short-term shocks. Inflation targeting requires index of core inflation, that independent from shortterm shocks and demonstrates the changes of the trend inflation. Reserve Banks pay attention on the changes in the trend inflation, when they take decisions about monetary policy, because it’s more informative than consumer price index for estimation of medium-term inflation risks. The objective of this article is detecting the index of core inflation that could be appropriate for monetary policy. There are some different measures of core <b>inflation</b> <b>based</b> on practice of Reserve Banks from different countries and economic articles.

Thus, (3) the considered model survives current observational data. The COBE-DMR quadrupole data (4) give constraints on the coupling constant and the energy scale during inflation, and (5) require the gravitational wave contribution to be suppressed.
