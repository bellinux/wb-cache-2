Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget.

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> changing applications.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. <b>In</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted.

Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in color and texture <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> other changes.

The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the time {{that there would be no}} league in 2009/10. The Wildcats eventually received backing from property developer Diploma Group, while the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.|$|E

500|$|Românul Literar was a {{voice of}} anti-nationalist and anti-traditionalist sentiment, rejecting the school formed around Sămănătorul magazine, and {{promoting}} the Symbolists; its agenda has been summarized as [...] "anti-Sămănătorist", and <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> modern French literature.

Cruceanu, who joined the literary club while still a high school student, recalls being impressed by Caion's status as [...] "a literary historian and critic", [...] "his restrained demeanor and his intelligence, with its inscrutable pursuits." [...] However, Caion seemed [...] "ill and troubled", and had [...] "an unnatural and mean passion for going after those people who had {{made a name for}} themselves in our cultural life", with his [...] "venomous weaponry".
