40|$|Confronted {{with public}} {{concerns}} about health and obesity, food companies are taking several initiatives. However, {{it is unclear}} to what extent they should communicate these policies. This article explores reactions in the blogosphere to health-related announcements by large food companies. Results show that taste-related announcements generate not only more reactions, but also more positive buzz than knowledge-related announcements. Valence is influenced by <b>issue</b> <b>association</b> per company type: those with highest obesity associations generate more negative blog posts. In case of low <b>issue</b> <b>association,</b> there are only limited blogosphere reactions. This analysis {{has important implications for}} managing interaction with social media...|$|R
