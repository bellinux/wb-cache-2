5|$|Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose {{name has}} {{become synonymous with}} greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> demoralize Tom and break him of his {{religious}} faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, in Week 17 {{against the}} Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when {{teammate}} Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed {{on him with}} 5:15 left in the game. Luckily for him, there was no ACL damage, according to his MRI. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but didn't play due to the injury against Minnesota. Though he participated in the team's first four training camp practices, he hadn't participated in any other practices since July 31. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee, and has stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> play in the 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half.|$|E

25|$|The game {{follows the}} adventures of the player {{character}} Sneaky, a thief. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> escape from prison, avoid enemies and steal rubies in the process. The player is generally encouraged to avoid the guards, but various weapons can be unlocked for Sneaky's use. The iOS version of Sneaky Sneaky received generally positive feedback from critics. It was praised for its battle system. The PC version, on the other hand, received more mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Victor Fries / Mr. Freeze [...] A Nobel Prize-winning {{molecular}} biologist and two-time Olympic decathlete who suffers a terrible accident {{while trying to}} cryogenically [...] preserve his terminally ill wife. As a result, he {{is transformed into a}} criminal forced to live in a special sub-zero suit powered by diamonds. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> hold Gotham to ransom {{in order to get the}} money he needs to complete his research to find a cure for his wife's disease.|$|E
500|$|A nonbinding {{referendum}} in 2008 resulted in 72.5 {{percent of voters}} supporting NATO accession. In May 2013, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for his country from NATO in 2014. In June 2014, diplomats from NATO suggested that while a MAP was unlikely, a package of [...] "reinforced cooperation" [...] agreements was a possible compromise. Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed that this could include the building of military capabilities and armed forces training.|$|E

500|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} a youth named Benjamin {{in his quest}} to save the world. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine {{the state of the}} world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways. Many series staples are eliminated, such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received [...] middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story. Over time, the game has kept the reputation for being a [...] "beginner's Final Fantasy" [...] and has been praised for its music.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the first}} member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the {{organization}} in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, {{who was a member}} himself. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so. Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E
500|$|Spinoza, {{with his}} determinism, {{believes}} that {{man and nature}} must be unified under a consistent set of laws; God and nature are one, {{and there is no}} free will. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, intentionality, ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide a unified explanation of all these things within a naturalistic framework, and his notion of conatus is central to this project. For example, an action is [...] "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and conatus of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are determined in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free {{in the sense that it}} is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.|$|E
50|$|After the match, Baghdatis stated <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> finish 2015 in the world's top 50, {{believing in}} 4-5 years he {{can reach the}} world's top 10 again.|$|R

50|$|In early 2012, Jarrett Streebin {{began working}} on EasyPost after {{experiencing}} the difficulty of integrating shipping APIs. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> simplify shipping online across all the major carriers.|$|R
500|$|With {{extensive}} knowledge {{regarding the}} intricacies of the defense, Ryan has been criticized for not devoting similar time and effort into coaching the offense. Ryan refuted this, stating <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> implement a proficient running game, citing a desire to [...] "get after" [...] the opponent through running the ball. Ryan has also stated that passing the ball is important but should not be used incessantly as there should be a balance between both aspects of the offense. In 2009 and 2010, the Jets were ranked first and fourth overall in the league in rushing which coincided with their two playoff appearances. In 2011, the Jets attempted to convert to a more pass-oriented offense, which have become more widely used in the NFL, however, the team struggled with this adjustment and reverted to their former run-oriented offense {{by the middle of the}} season. His defensive strategy, in contrast, tends to be more elaborate taking into consideration his experience in the field. There are six different defensive formations utilized in football, but the two commonly used formations are the 3–4 formation, with three defensive lineman and four linebackers, and the 4–3 formation, with four defensive lineman and three linebackers. The Jets utilized the former of the two popular formations; however, Ryan tended to employ all six formations in varying forms. Furthermore, he often calls audibles [...] that have the defense line up in one formation and switch to another so as to cloak their intentions and confuse and pressure the opponent.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{has also}} {{examined}} {{the question of}} whether memory for certain types of relations is more heavily dependent on the activity of the hippocampus, and whether there are types of memories that do not depend on the hippocampus.

2500|$|Mike and Wendy Carey founded Seirus Innovation, {{a privately}} held company that {{manufactures}} ski and snowboarding gloves, face protection, and other cold-weather accessories, in 1979.

50|$|In 1925 a young Armenian-Iranian, Ovanes Ohanian (Oganianse), {{who studied}} film in Cinema Akademi Of Moscow, {{returned}} <b>to</b> Iran. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> establish a film {{industry in the}} country.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure that the game was balanced, the {{designers}} had to play through maps several times to ensure that they were not unbalanced. However, Shimojo commented that once he became more astute at the game, it became hard for him to judge {{what it would be like}} for a novice to play, though he comments that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the difficulty level is right enough to allow the largest number of people to play it. Afterward, his comments are sent off to other staff members so he can be sure that he got it right. From then on, the game is sent to Nintendo's debugging team, who will then provide insight on the balance to the development team, who makes adjustments accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{ends with}} Ed getting Christopher a Golden Retriever puppy, whom Christopher gets to name, and {{promising}} {{that he will}} rebuild trust with Christopher slowly, [...] "no matter how long it takes". Christopher asserts that he will take further A-level exams and attend university. He completes his mathematics A-level with top grades despite having eaten and slept very little. Earlier in the story he talks about wanting to become an astronaut, {{but at the end}} he declares that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> become a scientist. The book ends with Christopher optimistic about his future, having solved the mystery of the murdered dog, gone to London on his own, found his mother, written a book about his adventures, and achieved an A in his A-level maths exam.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Terry Anderson {{established}} {{a company called}} Autonomous Tractor Corporation (ATC) located in North Dakota. The SPIRIT driverless tractor {{is a product of}} ATC. Anderson thought tractors were getting bigger and more expensive while not improving in quality. He thus came out of retirement to create the SPIRIT. The tractors Anderson helped create were initially made to follow a main tractor (that has a driver) but are now moving towards independent functioning. [...] Anderson tested half-scale models of his automated tractor design at his second home in Texas. He presented his model at the Big Iron Farm Show in September 2012. Anderson stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build 25 units of his automated tractor in 2013 and sell them at a discount price for farmers to test.|$|E

50|$|At Stanford, Germann {{focused on}} {{phosgene}} as a liquid solvent. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop a solvent-system definition of acids and bases that {{would apply to}} compounds dissolved in solvents such as phosgene.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{focused on}} a goby fish named Hazedon, who was the {{offspring}} of a mermaid and a blowfish. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> travel the world on an adventure with his best friend, Puyan.|$|R
2500|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica {{includes}} many accounts of miracles and visions. These were de rigueur in medieval religious narrative, but Bede {{appears to have}} avoided relating the more extraordinary tales; and, remarkably, he makes almost no claims for miraculous events at his own monastery. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} Bede did believe in miracles, but the ones he does include are often stories of healing, or of events that could plausibly be explained naturally. [...] The miracles served the purpose of setting an example to the reader, and Bede explicitly states that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> teach morality through history, saying [...] "If history records good things of good men, the thoughtful reader is encouraged to imitate what is good; if it records evil of wicked men, the devout reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Drǎgulescu {{was very}} {{disappointed}} when he failed to medal at the Beijing Olympics, saying [...] "my soul broke" [...] after he fell on the landing of his second vault attempt. He announced his retirement and his intention to become a gymnastic coach. However, he reconsidered retirement and went to compete in Germany for Fabian Hambuchen’s club, KTV Straubenhardt. In the club's first three competitions, Dragulescu competed on floor and vault, obtaining the league's top scores on the latter event: 16.500 {{in the first two}} competitions, and 16.300 in the third one. The club won the second place in December 2008. After competing in the German league Dragulescu formally announced his retirement. He went to coach gymnastics alongside his former team colleagues Marius Urzică and Dan Potra at [...] Dinamo Club Bucharest. He declared that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create a gymnast better than himself.|$|E
2500|$|He {{transposed}} his tumultuous childhood experiences {{into the}} characters of his novels - hence {{the birth of the}} recurring hero in most of his books: the rebellious, warring child who fights against injustice, fights for his rights and for the preservation of his or her individuality. Whether it is the cheeky little girl Emma, who drives her father nuts with her world-changing ideas and her constant desire for free spirit or twelve-year-old Emily, who one morning wakes up realizing she had switched bodies with her mom - they all have one thing in common: an undeterred fighting spirit to understand the world around them and to make the world understand them. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> help his readers 'to identify their own dreams and conflicts in the adventures of the heroes and heroines in my novels, who must face realities and choices, not always easy or happy ones.' ...|$|E
5000|$|José Valim is {{the creator}} of the Elixir {{programming}} language, an R&D project of Plataformatec. <b>His</b> <b>goals</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> enable higher extensibility and productivity in the Erlang VM while keeping compatibility with Erlang's ecosystem.|$|R
