Photoluminescence studies demonstrate a high P optica quality. From the systematic small blue {{shift of the}} <b>dot</b> luminescence <b>with</b> <b>dot</b> diameter it is shown that the dots reveal a steep radial potential and that the blue shift is caused by quantization. The increase of relative quantum efficiency of the <b>dots</b> <b>with</b> decreasing diameter {{can be explained by}} a model which takes the graded shape of the potential and the carrier capture from the barrier into account.

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io.

Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced.

40|$|Magnetic {{semiconductor}} quantum <b>dots</b> <b>with</b> a few carriers {{represent an}} interesting model system where ferromagnetic interactions can be tuned by voltage. By designing {{the geometry of}} a doped quantum dot, one can tailor the anisotropic quantum states of magnetic polarons. The strong anisotropy of magnetic polaron states in disk-like quantum <b>dots</b> <b>with</b> holes comes from the spin splitting in the valence band. The binding energy and spontaneous magnetization of quantum <b>dots</b> oscillate <b>with</b> the number of particles and reflect the shell structure. Due to the Coulomb interaction, the maximum binding energy and spin polarization of magnetic polarons occur in the regime of Hund's rule when the total spin of holes in a quantum <b>dot</b> is maximum. <b>With</b> increasing number of particles in a quantum dot and for certain orbital configurations, the ferromagnetic state becomes especially stable or may have broken symmetry. In quantum <b>dots</b> <b>with</b> a strong ferromagnetic interaction, the ground state can undergo a transition from a magnetic to a nonmagnetic state with increasing temperature or decreasing exchange interaction.
