5|$|The Duke {{was based}} on the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia design. It {{incorporated}} three sets of modified Caprotti valve gear, relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more efficient than Walschaerts or Stephenson valve gear. The Duke was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also returned negative feedback, reporting problems with the poor draughting of the locomotive which resulted in difficulty adhering to the timetables.|$|E
5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

500|$|Certain fungi, in {{particular}} [...] "white rot" [...] fungi, can degrade insecticides, herbicides, pentachlorophenol, creosote, coal tars, and <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels</b> {{and turn them}} into carbon dioxide, water, and basic elements. Fungi have been shown to biomineralize uranium oxides, suggesting they may have application in the bioremediation of radioactively polluted sites.|$|R
50|$|The {{threat of}} {{wildfires}} does not cease after the flames have passed, as smoldering <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels</b> {{may continue to}} burn unnoticed for days after flaming. It is during this phase that either the burn area exterior or the complete burn area of a fire is cooled so as to not reignite another fire.|$|R
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E
25|$|For the {{manufacturing}} of the on-board power plant, a contract was {{signed with the}} German MAN Diesel company based in Augsburg. The contract, worth over €100 million, includes the supply of 24 large-bore diesel engines, along with electro-mechanical equipment to be installed on four powerships with a total output of 400 MW. Twenty one of them are of type 18V51/60DF dual-fuel diesel engines {{and the three of}} type 14V48/60 <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil engines. The dual-fuel diesel engines allow the powership to generate electricity running either on <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> or natural gas, whatever the infrastructure is available at site.|$|E

30|$|Burnout time or flame {{persistence}} is {{an important}} fuel characteristic related largely to <b>fuel</b> particle size. <b>Heavier</b> <b>fuels</b> such as eucalypt litter have burnout times ranging up to several minutes, whereas the so-called “flash fuels” such as grass, burnout in a few seconds. Heat penetration into the soil and damage to vegetation {{is directly related to}} this duration effect.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a theoretical {{treatment of the}} vaporization process of medium and heavy oils. The results of this investigation, which were mostly obtained from the lighter components of the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels,</b> require a 10 - or 16 -fold vaporization in comparison with gasoline. We must attain a still finer degree of atomization, in order to include the heavier components...|$|R
50|$|The modern Diesel {{engine is}} a hybrid {{incorporating}} {{the features of}} direct (airless) injection and compression-ignition, both patented (No. 7146) as Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air by Akroyd-Stuart and Charles Richard Binney in May 1890. Another patent (No. 15,994) was taken out on 8 October 1890, which details the working of a complete engine where air and fuel are introduced separately. But such a system was not feasible for the essential vaporization of <b>heavier</b> <b>fuels</b> for combustion in an enigne and moreover the modern diesel engine operation is based on vaporization by the fuel delivery system and not by internal thermal vaporization as in hot bulb which bears more similarity to original solution of Rudolph Diesel by employing injection and vaporization through air blast system which was the only technology available at that time capable of vaporizing and introducing <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> at high pressure in the cylinder.|$|R
25|$|When China Navigation Co Ltd {{bought the}} South Pacific service from Andrew Weir Shipping in 2006, the four SA-15 class freighters were time {{chartered}} {{by the new}} owner and further modified during drydocking in Singapore. During the refit an additional Wärtsilä Auxpac 6L20 generating set, capable of operating on the same grade of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil as the main engines, was installed alongside the existing smaller 624TS diesel generators and some ballast tanks were converted to <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil to increase the bunker capacity. Fuel efficiency was further improved by grit blasting the underwater parts to minimize hull roughness and installing wake-equalising ducts and a rudder bulb. The ships' container capacity was also increased to 702 TEU.|$|E
25|$|At its rated power, {{the plant}} burned 159,000litres (1,000barrels) of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil per hour. Ten 200,000-barrel fuel storage tanks are located behind {{the plant and}} were {{supplied}} with fuel from the Montreal and Lévis refineries by tanker or by rail.|$|E
25|$|In December 1990, Quebec's Minister of Energy, Lise Bacon, asked Hydro-Québec to {{consider}} converting {{the plant to}} natural gas to lower sulfur dioxide emissions {{as well as a}} cost-saving measure — at the time, <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil was sold at $C28/barrel while the equivalent natural gas was selling for C$18.|$|E
50|$|The Otto Cycle {{engine was}} {{eventually}} adopted {{to run on}} Ligroin and eventually gasoline, and many gases. During WWII Otto engines were run on more than 62 different fuels, such as wood gas, coal gas, propane, hydrogen, benzene, and many more. The engine is limited to light fuels. A later development of this engine, known as the Diesel engine can burn <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels</b> and oils.|$|R
60|$|They tramped to {{the south}} shore of the island, and there, in a nook that was {{sheltered}} from the north wind, they went into temporary camp, cutting down some brushwood and <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> and building a fire. Over the flames they arranged a stick, from which they hung a kettle filled with water obtained by chopping a hole through the ice of the river.|$|R
40|$|It seems hardly {{necessary}} {{to use a}} supercharger near sea level simply to mix the gases. The importance of the supercharger will increase {{with the use of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels.</b> Before long we shall probably be using two-stroke-cycle and four-stroke-cycle scavenging engines on airplanes. In accord with the present tendency, we shall present here the French solutions of the problem in a practical rather than in a purely theoretical manner...|$|R
25|$|In {{continental}} Europe, {{the price}} formula indexation {{does not follow}} the same format, and it varies from contract to contract. Brent crude price (B), <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil price (HFO), light fuel oil price (LFO), gas oil price (GO), coal price, electricity price and in some cases, consumer and producer price indexes are the indexation elements of price formulas.|$|E
25|$|Internally, all six vessels used Brown-Curtis geared {{steam turbine}} engines, which could use either <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil or coal for propulsion.

25|$|Internally, {{the engines}} were <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil-fired steam turbine engines. Two vessels (Hinoki and Yanagi) used Brown-Curtis turbine engines, {{and the other}} two (Momo and Kashi) used Japanese-designed geared turbine engines. The smaller engines gave a smaller rated power of 16,700 shp, which allowed only for a speed of , and limited range due to high fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|The A-12 was {{produced}} from 1962 to 1964 and operated from 1963 to 1968. It was the {{precursor to the}} twin-seat U.S. Air Force YF-12 prototype interceptor, M-21 launcher for the D-21 drone, and the SR-71 Blackbird, a slightly longer variant able to carry a <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> and camera load. The A-12's final mission was flown in May 1968, and the program and aircraft retired in June. The program was officially revealed in the mid-1990s.|$|R
40|$|A clear {{distinction}} emerges between the properties [`]flammability' and [`]ignitability' by defining {{them in terms}} of temperature. The light hydrocarbon fuels, for example, are seen to produce flammable mixtures at near ambient temperatures and thus, for fire safety, require protection from sparks, flames and other localised sources of energy within the vicinity of storage. The <b>heavier</b> <b>fuels,</b> and lubricants, on the other hand, are not flammable in this way, but would ignite spontaneously if subjected to general overheating. ...|$|R
50|$|Inclusion of such {{mechanisms}} within computational flow solvers still {{represents a}} pretty challenging task mainly in two aspects. First, {{the number of}} degrees of freedom (proportional {{to the number of}} chemical species) can be dramatically large; second the source term due to reactions introduces a disparate number of time scales which makes the whole dynamical system stiff. As a result, the direct numerical simulation of turbulent reactive flows with <b>heavy</b> <b>fuels</b> soon becomes intractable even for modern supercomputers.|$|R
25|$|Completion of {{the repair}} and {{expansion}} of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, with a maximum capacity of 80 MW, {{is scheduled to be}} completed by 2018. Construction of three new <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil power plants is expected to boost electrical capacity by 38 MW. In 2013, Liberia began importing power from neighboring Ivory Coast and Guinea through the West African Power Pool.|$|E
25|$|ROUSH CleanTech's propane autogas-fueled {{vehicles}} {{have the}} same horsepower, torque and towing capacity as their gasoline-powered equivalents. The shift to a dedicated liquid propane fuel system does not affect vehicle functionality. Ford's factory warranty remains intact on the ROUSH CleanTech vehicles. Propane emits fewer greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides than gasoline, diesel, <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil or E85 ethanol per unit of energy.|$|E

40|$|A {{new fuel}} element (called CARA) {{designed}} for two different heavy water reactors (HWRs) is presented. CARA could match fuel requirements of both (one CANDU and one unique Siemens's design) Argentine HW reactors. It keeps the <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> mass density and hydraulic flow restriction in both reactors together with improving both thermomechanic and thermalhydraulic, safety margins of present fuels. In addition, the CARA design {{could be considered}} as another design line {{for the next generation}} of CANDU fuels intended for higher burnup...|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly. Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due {{to the constant}} hydrogen boil-off, the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for ICBMs and other rocket applications {{with the need for}} short launch preparations.|$|R

25|$|Like {{all modern}} Finnish icebreakers, Kontio has a {{diesel-electric}} propulsion system. It utilizes the so-called power plant principle {{in which the}} main generators provide electricity for all shipboard consumers through a common busbar. Her main generators, four 16-cylinder Wärtsilä Vasa 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines producing 5,460kW each and driving 7,540 kVA Kymi-Strömberg alternators, are located on the upper deck beneath the helicopter platform. In addition, she has two smaller Wärtsilä 4R22/26 generators with an output of 350kW for use in ports. The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the seakeeping characteristics of the icebreaker by moving {{the center of gravity}} higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding. , Kontio and her sister ship Otso are the only Finnish icebreakers running on <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cargo}} {{is carried on}} the main deck, the barges have {{considerable}} tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the pusher's auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> oil and medium speed diesels.|$|E
5000|$|Reactive flash {{volatilization}} {{was demonstrated}} in 2006 {{in the journal}} Science by the high temperature (700-800 °C) conversion of soybean oil (triglycerides) and sugar (D-(+)-glucose) to synthesis gas (H2 + CO) and olefins (ethylene and propylene).

50|$|In North America, No. 2 {{diesel fuel}} is recommended, {{since it has}} a higher cetane number than No. 1 fuel, and has lower {{viscosity}} (better ability to flow) than <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> oils. Some owners in North America, where cetane levels are generally poor (as low as 40), use additives, or premium diesel, to get cetane numbers closer to the standard levels found in the European market (at least 51) where the engine is designed. Improved cetane reduces emissions while improving performance, and may increase fuel economy.|$|R
