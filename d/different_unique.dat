5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a <b>different,</b> <b>unique</b> kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
