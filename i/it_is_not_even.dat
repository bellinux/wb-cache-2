5|$|In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR {{absorption}} peaks {{are commonly}} observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic {{structure of the}} corresponding defects is yet unknown and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia {{is often associated with}} those hydrogen defects, but again, this assignment is yet unproven.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

25|$|The Cantor set {{contains}} as {{many points}} as the interval {{from which it}} is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.|$|E

25|$|In {{professional}} diving, solo diving {{is normal}} procedure when one diver {{is sufficient to}} perform the required task, particularly on surface supplied equipment, {{to the extent that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> noted as an exception. However, a standby diver is required at the surface or at the bell, and the working diver must be in communication with the supervisor at the surface. Procedures for the dive are based on assessed risk.|$|E
25|$|An object {{can cross}} through {{the event horizon}} {{of a black hole}} from the outside, and then fall rapidly to the central region where our {{understanding}} of physics breaks down. Since within a black hole the forward light-cone is directed towards the center and the backward light-cone is directed outward, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> possible to define time-reversal in the usual manner. The only way anything can escape from a black hole is as Hawking radiation.|$|E
25|$|No native {{sources for}} the history of Mitanni have been found so far.

The definition and history of Mitanni is further beset by a lack of differentiation between linguistic, ethnic and political groups.|$|E

25|$|Scuticaria itirapinensis, {{the last}} species of Brazilian southeast, {{is the one}} that closely resembles Amazonian Scuticaria steelei, {{although}} it can be easily separated because of its strong yellow flowers and much shorter leaves, besides slight differences on the proportions of floral structures. A Scuticaria steelei presents entirely pale yellow flowers, completely covered by spaced small darker stains, However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> necessary to observe the flowers to identify it as their leaves are about one meter long, and there are references of plants measuring almost one and a half meter.|$|E
25|$|When {{the sign}} of the cash flows changes more than once, for example when {{positive}} cash flows are followed by negative ones and then by positive ones (+ + − − − +), the IRR may have multiple real values. In a series of cash flows like (minus&10, 21, minus&11), one initially invests money, so a high rate of return is best, but then receives more than one possesses, so then one owes money, so now a low rate of return is best. In this case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> clear whether a high or a low IRR is better.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on {{the complexity and}} exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Ω(NlogN) (i.e., order NlogN or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as cache or CPU pipeline optimization.|$|E

25|$|Since human plague {{is rare in}} {{most parts}} of the world, routine {{vaccination}} is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with enzootic plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western United States. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with Y. pestis organisms resistant to antimicrobials; (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with Y. pestis; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the rank of yokozuna is unclear, {{and there are two}} {{competing}} legends. According to one, a 9th-century wrestler named Hajikami tied a shimenawa around his waist as a handicap and dared any to touch it, creating sumo as it is now known in the process. According to the other, legendary wrestler Akashi Shiganosuke tied the shimenawa around his waist in 1630 as a sign of respect when visiting the Emperor, and was posthumously awarded the title for the first time. There is little supporting evidence for either theory—in fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> certain that Akashi actually existed—but it is known that by November 1789, yokozuna starting from the fourth yokozuna Tanikaze Kajinosuke and the fifth yokozuna Onogawa Kisaburō were depicted in ukiyo-e prints as wearing the shimenawa. These two wrestlers were both awarded yokozuna licences by the prominent Yoshida family.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore—or even a half-forgotten Celtic deity—who became credited with real deeds in the distant past. They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish Hengist and Horsa, who may be totemic horse-gods that later became historicised. Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of eastern Britain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts. Neither the Historia nor the Annales calls him [...] "rex": the former calls him instead [...] "dux bellorum" [...] (leader of battles) and [...] "miles" [...] (soldier).|$|E
500|$|Since {{the work}} of Harary and Ross, many others have devised {{algorithms}} for various versions of the clique problem.

Also in the 1970s, beginning with {{the work of}} [...] and , researchers began using the theory of NP-completeness and related intractability results to provide a mathematical explanation for the perceived difficulty of the clique problem.
