Although Soma's sole desire <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos. Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.|$|E

25|$|A common {{defensive}} configuration <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{the general}} at its starting position, deploy one advisor and one elephant {{on the two}} points {{directly in front of}} the general, and to leave the other advisor and elephant in their starting positions, to the side of the general. In this setup, the advisor-elephant pairs support each other, and the general is immune from attacks by cannons. Losing any of the pieces makes the general vulnerable to cannon, and the setup may need to be abandoned. The defender may move advisors or elephants away from the general, or even sacrifice them intentionally, to ward off attack by a cannon.|$|E

I mean, we don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come. His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are concerned, of the decade.|$|E
25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|E

500|$|The frescoes on {{the ceiling}} of the Sistine Chapel had a number of {{interventions}} prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 Paolo Giovio wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by saltpetre and cracks. The effect of saltpetre <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a white efflorescence. [...] Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay Michelangelo's colours rediscovered, that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of linseed or walnut oil which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.|$|E

The series was renewed for that third season on May 7, 2015. By April 2015, Marvel had been developing a spinoff series to accompany the season, starring Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood, but ABC opted not to go ahead with it, with entertainment president Paul Lee saying, [...] "We thought the right thing now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment".|$|E
500|$|In the beginning, Seo's {{transition}} to the ABT company was difficult.

Seo noted that [...] "the ABT style <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the dancers alone. Individual character matters here, and dance that lacks originality cannot survive". She was able to adapt with the assistance of her mentors who also at the time helped her overcome a serious back injury. In March 2006, she was promoted to the rank of corps de ballet. She gained significant attention in 2009 when she performed the female lead in MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet, La Sylphide, and On the Dnieper. She debuted as Juliet on her twenty-third birthday which she has said was [...] "one of [...] favorites". Cory Stearns, at the time a newly promoted member of the corps de ballet, partnered her as the other titular character of Romeo.|$|E

[...] The husband decides to put his mother in an old folks' home and the wife informs her she <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> immediately. Little Marie is upset that her grandmother has to leave because she was [...] "only in the way" [...] and decides that as a cripple, so was she. Marie pens a letter to this effect and runs away to the old people's home. The parents frantically search for Marie and discover the note.

In August 2014, Adrianne Palicki was cast as Morse in a guest role, and later promoted to series regular with the season two episode [...] "Aftershocks". By April 2015, Marvel was developing a spin-off series focused on those characters with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. showrunner Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski. The spin-off would be based on storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Palicki and Blood were in final discussions to headline the potential new series, but ABC passed on the project by May 7, 2015, when they announced their series renewals, cancellations, and pickups. ABC entertainment president Paul Lee explained, [...] "We thought the right thing now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment," [...] though he did not rule out returning to the spin-off in the future.|$|E
