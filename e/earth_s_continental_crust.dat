40|$|Despite the {{economic}} importance of chalcophile (sulfide-loving) and siderophile (metal-loving) elements (CSEs), {{it is unclear}} how they become enriched or depleted in the <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> compared with the oceanic crust. This {{is due in part to}} our limited understanding of the partitioning behaviour of the CSEs. Here I compile compositional data for mid-ocean ridge basalts and subduction-related volcanic rocks. I show that the mantle-derived melts that contribute to oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> formation rarely avoid sulfide saturation during cooling in the crust and, on average, subduction-zone magmas fractionate sulfide at the base of the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> prior to ascent. Differentiation of mantle-derived melts enriches lower crustal sulfide- and silicate-bearing cumulates in some CSEs compared with the upper crust. This storage predisposes the cumulate-hosted compatible CSEs (such as Cu and Au) to be recycled back into the mantle during subduction and delamination, resulting in their low contents in the bulk <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> and potentially contributing to the scarcity of ore deposits in the upper <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> By contrast, differentiation causes the upper oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> to become enriched in incompatible CSEs (such as W) compared with the lower oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> Consequently, incompatible CSEs are predisposed to become enriched in subduction-zone magmas that contribute to <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> formation and are less susceptible to removal from the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> via delamination compared with the compatible CSEs...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} the origin of the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> can be {{resolved}} into two fundamental questions: (1) the location and mechanisms of initial mantle extraction of the primitive crust and (2) the processes by which this primitive crust is converted into the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> that presently exists. We know that Archean <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is compositionally distinct from younger <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> Archean magmatism was dominantly bimodal, mafic thoeleiitic plus dacitic, heavy rare earth element depleted, in contrast to the dominantly unimodal, roughly andesitic calc-alkaline magmatism on younger crust [Taylor and McLennan, 1985; Condie, 1989]. The problem is whether these compositional differences are primarily due to different mechanisms of crustal extraction from the mantle or to different mechanisms of differentiation and alteration of newly formed <b>continental</b> <b>crust...</b>|$|R

30|$|Andesite, {{the name}} of which {{is derived from the}} Andes Mountains, and its {{plutonic}} equivalents such as tonalite and granodiorite represent magmatism in subduction zones where active arcs form because of plate subduction. As a result, the “andesite model” was put forward by Taylor (1967) in which <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is created at subduction zones by magmatism. However, it is also now well known that while andesites are predominant in continental arcs with mature <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> basalts are the major volcanic products at intra-oceanic arcs with a juvenile crust (e.g., Gill, 1981; Ewart, 1982; Tatsumi and Eggins, 1995).

5000|$|The {{basement}} {{rocks of}} the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> {{tend to be}} much older than the oceanic crust. The oceanic crust can be from 0-250 million years in age, and is usually thinner (10 miles or so) and composed of basaltic rocks. <b>Continental</b> <b>crust</b> is older because <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is light and thick enough {{so it is not}} subducted, while oceanic crust is periodically subducted and replaced at subduction and oceanic rifting areas.|$|R
25|$|As {{explained}} above, tectonic plates {{may include}} <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> or oceanic crust, and most plates contain both. For example, the African Plate includes {{the continent and}} parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The distinction between oceanic <b>crust</b> and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is based on their modes of formation. Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers, and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through tectonic processes, though some of these terranes may contain ophiolite sequences, which are pieces of oceanic crust considered {{to be part of the}} continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents. Oceanic crust is also denser than <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> owing to their different compositions. Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements ("mafic") than <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> ("felsic"). As a result of this density stratification, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the Pacific Plate), while <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> buoyantly projects above sea level (see the page isostasy for explanation of this principle).|$|R
5000|$|Both the <b>continental</b> and oceanic <b>crust</b> [...] "float" [...] on the mantle.

Because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> (sial) becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust (sima), and the transition zone {{is referred to as the}} Conrad discontinuity.|$|R

40|$|Partial melting of the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> {{has long}} been of {{interest}} to petrologists as a small-scale phenomenon. Mineral assemblages in the cores of old, eroded mountain chains that formed where continents collided show that the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> was buried deeply enough to have melted extensively. Geochemical, experimental, petrological and geodynamic modelling now show that when the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> melts the consequences are crustal-scale. The combination of melting and regional deformation is critical: the presence of melt on grain boundaries weakens rocks, and weak rocks deform faster, influencing the way mountain belts grow and how rifts propagate. Tectonic forces also drive the movement of melt out of the lower <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> resulting in an irreversible chemical differentiation of the crust...|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} igneous rock, or {{petrogenesis}} , in continental arcs {{is more complicated}} than that in oceanic arcs. The partial melting of the subducting oceanic slab generates primary magma, which would be contaminated by the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> materials when it travels through the <b>crust.</b> Because the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is felsic or silica while the juvenile primary magma is typically mafic, the composition of magmas in continental arcs is the product of mixing between igneous differentiation of mafic magmas and felsic or silica crust meltings. The mixing of existing <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> lower part of lithosphere or lithospheric mantle under the <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> the subducting oceanic crust and sediments, the mantle wedge and the underplates materials together is the main source of continental arc rocks.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the persistence of <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> the size, shape, and number of continents are constantly changing through geologic time. Different tracts rift apart, collide and recoalesce {{as part of a}} grand supercontinent cycle.There are currently about 7 billion cubic kilometers of <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> but this quantity varies {{because of the nature of}} the forces involved. The relative permanence of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> contrasts with the short life of oceanic <b>crust.</b> Because <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is less dense than oceanic crust, when active margins of the two meet in subduction zones, the oceanic crust is typically subducted back into the mantle. <b>Continental</b> <b>crust</b> is rarely subducted (this may occur where continental crustal blocks collide and overthicken, causing deep melting under mountain belts such as the Himalayas or the Alps). For this reason the oldest rocks on Earth are within the cratons or cores of the continents, rather than in repeatedly recycled oceanic crust; the oldest intact crustal fragment is the Acasta Gneiss at 4.01 Ga, whereas the oldest oceanic crust (located on the Pacific Plate offshore of Kamchatka) is from the Jurassic (~180 Ma). <b>Continental</b> <b>crust</b> and the rock layers that lie on and within it are thus the best archive of Earth's history.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a matter}} of debate whether the amount of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> has been increasing, decreasing, or {{remaining}} constant over geological time.

However, while andesites are dominant in mature continental arcs, they are subordinate in juvenile oceanic arcs, resulting in a great conflict regarding the creation of the <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> We focused on the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc to assess this problem, as it is a juvenile intra-oceanic arc with a mid-crustal layer that has a seismic velocity identical to that of the bulk <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> Petrological modeling of the production of andesitic melts by the mixing of mantle-derived basalt with crust-derived, rhyolite magmas successfully reproduced the crust/mantle structure observed in seismic profiles of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc.
