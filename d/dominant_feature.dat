The dome structure is layered, with an outer waterproofed casing of reinforced concrete 4 centimeters (2.5inches) thick, and an inner concrete dome that is insulated by a layer of urethane foam.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|Many {{military}} camouflage patterns {{since the}} 1940s have been disruptively coloured, {{and with the}} issue of US Woodland pattern to United States armed forces from 1981, disruptive pattern became a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> of military uniforms. From 1969, Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) began to replace plain material for uniforms in the British Armed Forces and was later used by many other armies.|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{character}} {{refers to}} the general impression people have of an environment. The literature suggests that certain perceived <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> of the environment create this impression. One {{of the ways to}} investigate the <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> of a landscape has been a classification task where people are asked to classify a group of photographs of places into categories. Each of the categories is then investigated to determine the visible features that define that class. In a progressive classification task, this dissertation investigated the <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> in resort environments and identified the hierarchical order among the <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> discovered. The results revealed visual features in the following hierarchy: presence of water, presence of development, amount of development, type of water body present, presence of mountains. These features are often encountered in the landscape character and landscape aesthetics literature, a fact that verifies their importance in the perception of the landscape...|$|R

5|$|McCain's {{personal}} {{character has}} been a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> of his public image. This image includes the military service of both himself and his family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding {{the end of his}} first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature.</b> The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> on Poland's economic landscape {{beginning in the}} late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{increasingly}} developing field of biometric systems which is the identification of faces. The thesis {{deals with the}} possibilities of face localization in pictures and their normalization, which is necessary due to external influences {{and the influence of}} different scanning techniques. It describes various techniques of localization of <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> of the face such as eyes, mouth or nose. Not least, it describes different approaches to the identification of faces. Furthermore a it deals with an implementation of the <b>Dominant</b> Face <b>Features</b> Recognition application, which demonstrates chosen methods for localization of the <b>dominant</b> <b>features</b> (Hough Transform for Circles, localization of mouth using the location of the eyes) and for identification of a face (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Kernel Discriminant Analysis).

5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's <b>dominant</b> <b>feature,</b> its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia and Carolina, the Palladian {{manner is}} epitomised in {{numerous}} Tidewater plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall or Westover Plantation, or Drayton Hall near Charleston. These examples are all classic American colonial {{examples of a}} Palladian taste that was transmitted through engravings, {{for the benefit of}} masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochere; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.|$|E

5|$|South India has two {{distinct}} styles of rock architecture, the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka. The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door {{leading to the}} sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams, which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate {{at the entrance of}} any temple in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a spherical stone finial, and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The origins of the gopuram {{can be traced back to}} early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century, under the Pandya rulers, these gateways became a <b>dominant</b> <b>feature</b> of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram.|$|E
