5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>GUI)</b> based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{software}} developers {{are responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>GUI)</b> is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E

5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>GUI)</b> applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{well known}} design patterns {{that are appropriate}} for designing Interactive Simulation components for educational purposes. These are the Delegation Event Model, used for linking between components, and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, used for connecting the components to their visualizations and <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> (<b>GUIs).</b> Combining both architectures, we have constructed Discrete Event Simulation (DES) components for modelling queuing networks in the Flash environment. The resulting components not only help teachers with little programming skill to construct simulation models, but also allow learners to conduct various experiments through interactive <b>Graphical</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (<b>GUIs)</b> and obtain feedbacks of model behaviour through a range of engaging visualizations...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of application-specific <b>Graphical</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (<b>GUI)</b> still needs considerable programming {{partly because the}} mapping between application data and its visual representation is complicated. This study proposes a system which generates GUIs by generalizing multiple sets of application data and its visualization examples. The most notable characteristic {{of the system is}} that programmers can interactively modify the mapping by "correcting" the system-generated visualization examples that represent the system's current notion of programmer's intentions. Conflicting mappings are automatically resolved via the use of constraint hierarchies. KEYWORDS: <b>Graphical</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces,</b> Programming by Example, Visual Parsing, Visualization, Constraint Hierarchies. 1 INTRODUCTION Although <b>Graphical</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (<b>GUI)</b> have become prevalent, the complexity and development cost of application-specific GUIs remain considerably high. To support such GUI programming, our previous work [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The user interface, {{also known}} as the shell, is either a {{command-line}} interface (CLI), a <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (<b>GUI),</b> or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems.
