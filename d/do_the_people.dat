2500|$|After Ament's {{death in}} January 1909, Judson Smith's successor, Dr. James Levi Barton (1855–1936) {{wrote in an}} {{obituary}} published in The Congregationalist: The cruel and baseless attack made upon him [...] in this country by Mark Twain, in 1901, left a deep wound in his heart, {{in spite of the}} fact that it was clearly shown that his acts had been above criticism. He said one night, as we were sitting in a Chinese inn upon our way to Shansi, [...] "I presume there are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief and a robber." [...] I tried to assure him that no missionary was more honored than he, none more absolutely trusted, as it had been proven that the charges had no foundation in fact. He replied, [...] "That is true, but <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> believe the proof, and will the truth ever catch up with the charge?' ...|$|E
2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall I <b>do?</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> are impatient; Chase has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?" [...] The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of [...] "greenbacks" [...] to meet its obligations.|$|E
