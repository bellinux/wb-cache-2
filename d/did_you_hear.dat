500|$|In 2007, Grant starred {{opposite}} Drew Barrymore in {{a parody}} of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as [...] "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough." [...] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare {{for his role as}} a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that [...] "paper dolls have more depth." [...] The film, with its revenues totalling $145million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame." [...] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite, starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics. Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called Grant a [...] "perfect leading man." [...] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Entertainment Weekly described his performance as [...] "the only bit of fun" [...] in the film. Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that [...] "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably." ...|$|E
