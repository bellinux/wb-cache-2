40|$|The cross-species {{transmission}} of viruses from one host species to another {{is responsible for the}} majority of emerging infections. However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to <b>jump</b> <b>host</b> species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission {{plays a major role in}} virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to <b>jump</b> <b>host</b> species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{discovery}} of new Brucella strains from different animal species {{and from the}} environment, ten Brucella species are nowadays included in the genus Brucella. Although the intracellular trafficking of Brucella is well described, the strategies developed by Brucella to survive and multiply in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, particularly to access nutriments during its intracellular journey, are still largely unknown. Metabolism and virulence of Brucella are now considered to be {{two sides of the}} same coin. Mechanisms presiding to the colonization of the pregnant uterus in different animal species are not known. Vaccination is the cornerstone of control programs in livestock and although the S 19, RB 51 (both in cattle) and Rev 1 (in sheep and goats) vaccines have been successfully used worldwide, they have drawbacks and thus the ideal brucellosis vaccine is still very much awaited. There is no vaccine available for pigs and wildlife. Animal brucellosis control strategies differ in the developed and the developing world. Most emphasis is put on eradication and on risk analysis to avoid the re-introduction of Brucella in the developed world. Information related to the prevalence of brucellosis is still scarce in the developing world and control programs are rarely implemented. Since there is no vaccine available for humans, prevention of human brucellosis relies on its control in the animal reservoir. Brucella is also considered to be an agent to be used in bio- and agroterrorism attacks. At the animal/ecosystem/human interface it is critical to reduce opportunities for Brucella to <b>jump</b> <b>host</b> species as already seen in livestock, wildlife and humans. This task is a challenge for the future in terms of veterinary public health, as for wildlife and ecosystem managers and will need a "One Health" approach to be successful. Peer reviewe...|$|E

However, how <b>host</b> <b>jumps</b> affect genome evolution remains largely unknown. To determine the patterns of sequence variation in the P. infestans lineage, we resequenced six genomes of four sister species.

These loci are enriched in genes induced in planta, implicating host adaptation in genome evolution. Unexpectedly, genes involved in epigenetic processes formed another class of rapidly evolving residents of the gene-sparse regions.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} of humans is so old that its population genetic structure reflects that of ancient human migrations. A closely related species, Helicobacter acinonychis, is specific for large felines, including cheetahs, lions, and tigers, whereas hosts {{more closely related}} to humans harbor more distantly related Helicobacter species. This observation suggests a <b>jump</b> between <b>host</b> species. But who ate whom and when did it happen? In order to resolve this question, we determined the genomic sequence of H. acinonychis strain Sheeba and compared it to genomes from H. pylori. The conserved core genes between the genomes are so similar that the <b>host</b> <b>jump</b> probably occurred within the last 200, 000 (range 50, 000 - 400, 000) years. However, the Sheeba genome also possesses unique features that indicate the direction of the <b>host</b> <b>jump,</b> namely from early humans to cats. Sheeba possesses an unusually large number of highly fragmented genes, many encoding outer membrane pro teins, which may have been destroyed in order to bypass deleterious responses from the feline host immune system. In addition, the few Sheeba-specific genes that were found include a cluster of genes encoding sialylation of the bacterial cell surface carbohydrates, which were imported by horizontal genetic exchange and might also help to evade host immune defenses. These results provide a genomic basis for elucidating molecular events that allow bacteria to adapt to novel animal hosts...|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), a {{bacterial}} pathogen of poultry, causes respiratory disease and conjunctivitis, which {{can result in}} decreased egg production and serious economic losses. This pathogen recently (mid- 1990 s) <b>jumped</b> <b>hosts</b> to wild House Finches, causing severe population declines, though {{we do not know}} the source of the initial jump or whether the pathogen can jump back into chickens from wild finches. Backyard chickens could be important intermediaries for the transmission of MG across species, since these animals are highly likely to contact wild birds. To assess this possibility, I tested five backyard flocks in and around Ames, IA for antibodies against MG, which indicate prior exposure to this pathogen. Additionally, I conducted House Finch surveys at each site to assess whether exposure to MG correlated with potential exposure to finches. Blood samples from 46 chickens revealed that 13 % of individuals (in 3 / 5 flocks) were likely exposed. In addition, flocks at sites with House Finches tended to show more MG exposure. This preliminary study suggests that MG is present in backyard flocks in IA, and that cross-species transmission is possible. However, further study at this wild-domestic interface is needed to determine whether such transmission truly occurs, and in which direction(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A virus causes disease {{across a}} broad host range {{including}} avian and mammalian species. Most influenza viruses are found in wild aquatic birds, are of low consequence and refrain from zoonotic transmission. However, some strains occasionally cross the species barrier, into domestic birds and a plethora of mammalian species, most notably swine and humans. Many of these infections are dead ends and quickly disappear from the species, but occasionally, a stable lineage is established and becomes endemic in an animal population. Avian Influenza virus (AIV) H 9 N 2 was predominantly found in wild ducks and shore birds across the globe with occasional infections in turkeys until the late 1980 ’s, {{at which point the}} virus became established in Eurasian poultry populations. In the late 1990 ’s the virus again <b>jumped</b> <b>hosts,</b> first into swine, and then into humans. Across many regions, these viruses appear to be gaining human-like virus characteristics. Here, the influenza receptor distribution in a range of poultry species has been characterized and shown that many of the birds were able to bind human-like binding viruses. While no large-scale H 9 N 2 human infections have occurred, the threat is there. The most likely route for this to occur is through reassortment with human viruses. Th...|$|R

Moreover, after the <b>host</b> <b>jump,</b> a clear and significant trend was evidenced toward a reduction in the distance between CPV- 2 and the dog codon bias over time. This evidence was not confirmed for FPV, suggesting that an equilibrium has been reached during the prolonged virus-host co-evolution.
