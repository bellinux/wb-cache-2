During this period she gathered his reminiscences for a biography.|$|E

5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{to the temple}} himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, {{he went to the}} temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E
5|$|Roundtree had {{scholarship}} {{offers from}} Eastern Michigan, Illinois, Purdue, Nebraska and Miami. He {{was considered a}} Purdue commit until getting a late scholarship offer from Michigan, which was his preferred school.

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses {{control of}} the bike and wipes out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E

He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals.

5|$|Brown {{was booked}} in Celtic's {{penultimate}} league game against Kilmarnock, which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over the disciplinary points threshold {{and receive a}} suspension {{for the first two}} matches of the 2011–12 season. Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3–0 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
