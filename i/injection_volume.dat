50|$|Earlier diesel pumps used an in-line layout with {{a series}} of {{cam-operated}} injection cylinders in a line, rather like a miniature inline engine. The pistons have a constant stroke volume, and <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> (i.e., throttling) is controlled by rotating the cylinders against a cut-off port that aligns with a helical slot in the cylinder. When all the cylinders are rotated at once, they simultaneously vary their <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> to produce more or less power from the engine. Inline pumps still find favour on large multi-cylinder engines such as those on trucks, construction plant, static engines and agricultural vehicles.|$|E

30|$|Clearly, an SWTT program {{involves}} {{many variables}} such as <b>injection</b> <b>volumes</b> and rates, shut-in time, and reacting tracer’s concentration, reaction rate and partitioning coefficient. The design of a successful SWTT should consider the various variables in play {{in light of the}} inherent reservoir uncertainties especially those in residual oil saturation, heterogeneity, and dispersivity. An appropriate tracer in terms of reaction rate and partitioning coefficient needs to be used. More importantly, the program needs to allow sufficient <b>injection</b> <b>volumes,</b> and tracer back-production. Numerical simulation of SWTTs can guide the design of a successful SWTT.|$|R

It was used in Japan on Toyota Carina T150 replacing the TTC-V (Vortex) exhaust gas recirculation approach used earlier, Toyota Corolla E80, and Toyota Sprinter. The lean mixture sensor was provided in the exhaust system to detect air-fuel ratios leaner than the theoretical air-fuel ratio. The fuel <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> was then accurately controlled by a computer using this detection signal to achieve lean air-fuel ratio feedback.For optimal combustion, the following items were applied: program independent injection that accurately changed the <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> and timing for individual cylinders, platinum plugs for improving ignition performance with lean mixtures, and high performance igniters.|$|E

50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the rotary pump or {{distributor}} pump was developed. It uses a single injection cylinder driven from an axial cam plate, which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger equipped engine to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|E

40|$|A flow {{injection}} (FI) preconcentration {{system has}} been coupled with a direct sample insertion (DSI) system for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).

50|$|Operation of {{technologies}} involving long-term geologic storage of waste fluids {{have been shown}} to induce seismic activity in nearby areas, and correlation of periods of seismic dormancy with minima in injection volumes and pressures has even been demonstrated for fracking wastewater injection in Youngstown, Ohio. Of particular concern to the viability of carbon dioxide storage from coal-fired power plants and similar endeavors is that the scale of intended CCS projects is much larger in both injection rate and total <b>injection</b> <b>volume</b> than any current or past operation that has already been shown to induce seismicity. As such, extensive modeling must be done of future injection sites in order to assess the risk potential of CCS operations, particularly in relation to the effect of long-term carbon dioxide storage on shale caprock integrity, as the potential for fluid leaks to the surface can be quite high for even small to moderate earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} {{air inlet}} behind the reduction gear has a de-icing device using hot air. The compressor's two axial stages use blisks. The shaft runs on ball bearings. Air {{flow through the}} annular combustion chamber is S-wise, with fuel being added in radial direction by a rotating atomizer disc. The blades of the three-stage turbine's wheels, also blisks, are air-cooled from the inside. The jet nozzle is fixed with an interior cone. Auxiliary drives are mounted on a mounting plate behind the inlet, which also has the connections for starter motor/generator, oil and fuel pumps, engine speed control and tachometer. There are also optional drives for an AC generator and a hydraulic pump. The whole engine is mounted at three points, two trunnions {{on the right and}} left front of the turbine casing and one on its underside to the rear. Speed control is effected automatically by governing the <b>injection</b> <b>volume,</b> with a thermal regulator allowing for short-term overloads.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainties in upfront {{predictions}} of hydraulic fracturing and gas production of underexplored shale gas targets are important as often large potential resources are deduced based on limited available data. In this paper, uncertainties are quantified by using normal distributions of different input parameters in wellbased models for hydraulic fracturing and gas production.
