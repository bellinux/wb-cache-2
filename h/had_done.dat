His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> however, he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.|$|E

5|$|At Devarakota, Harsha kills Ratnam and Sashi at {{the factory}} and construes it as an {{accident}} due to an inadvertent short-circuit, similar to what Sashi <b>had</b> <b>done</b> before Ravikanth's arrest years before.

5|$|Bart {{talks to}} Edna after class {{and starts to}} feel worse {{about what he did}} when he is unable to console her.

5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication.

5|$|Darwin {{had shown}} great {{ability as a}} {{collector}} and <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{the best he could}} with the reference books he had on ship.

5|$|Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime {{actually}} accomplished more in its short existence {{than the}} previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This was, of course, mainly due to the diligent preparatory work that Agents like the ubiquitous Gogel; Johannes Goldberg, for National Economy; and Johannes van der Palm, for National Education; <b>had</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors <b>had</b> <b>done</b> so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E
