40|$|The {{formation}} of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in various tobaccos {{has become a}} topic of importance in recent years. The significant {{formation of}} TSNAs in burley tobacco occurs after the yellowing phase of curing and is dependent on several factors, notably the fertility level during growth and the curing environment during the browning and drying phase. Several <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> studies at the University of Kentucky Agricultural Experimental Station {{have focused on the}} relationships of curing environment and the resulting TSNAs of lamina and midrib components. The environmental treatments have included whole plant harvest and natural air curing in a barn and <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> frames, <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> structure with supplemental fan circulation and laboratory chamber curing of 'bulk ' leaves in an accelerated eight to ten day schedule. Results show TSNA levels ranging from under 1 ppm up to 22 ppm for the various treatments. Generally, the lower levels of TSNA have resulted from curing in a more rapid drying regime than normal with the resultant leaf quality not as desirable to the buying representatives. Studies are continuing on a combination of cultural practices and curing environments that will produce desirable burley quality and the lowest possible TSNA levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} economical, {{alternative}} tobacco curing space has spurred interest in several <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> methods. Research efforts have developed and evaluated several one-tier portable frame and field structure designs over the years. Farmers have innovated and adapted additional ideas. The field framework described {{here is a}} combination of several methods and ideas that seem to have the best features for producers to follow. Several DOs and DON’Ts are stated along with suggested structural details to provide producers with the best possible guidance on this alternative <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> option. Although this method has higher risks from potential wind and rain damage than good barns or some other field structures, the trade-off is the low construction costs. It is not necessarily a “hang-it-and-leave-it ” type structure, as managing the plastic cover will greatly influence {{the quality and quantity of}} tobacco cured. Three main advantages of this post-row framework are the low cost, simple construction, and reduced labor for hanging and removing tobacco. A disadvantage is the added care and management to secure the cover against wind and rain. Length of Framework Needed The total length of framework needed is directly related to the stick spacing you can use. The number of sticks per 13 '- 3 " of clear space between posts is shown in Table 1, and the capacity of a 96 -ft framework (7 sections) is show...|$|E

In {{order to improve}} the anti-crack ability of concrete, expansive agents were used to compensate for concrete shrinkage. This paper investigates enhancing the behavior of large volume underground concrete structures with expansive agents. Field measurements of strain and laboratory specimen tests were conducted. The results of concrete specimen in laboratory curing condition indicate that the restrained expansion ratio of concrete with expansive agents rapidly increases within the first 3 days. Restrained expansion ratio reaches the peak value after 14 days and then decreases with the elapsed time. The restrained expansion ratio was found to maintain a value of approximately 0. 030 % after 28 days. The developing trend of restrained expansion ratio of the <b>field</b> <b>cured</b> specimen {{was found to be}} similar as that of the specimen cured in laboratory. However, the peak value and average value of restrained expansion ratio of the <b>field</b> <b>cured</b> specimen was found to be smaller than those of the laboratory <b>cured</b> specimen.

40|$|The {{influence}} of non-standard curing {{practice on the}} strengths of specimen and insitu concrete is evaluated by experimental testing. Samples were collected randomly from construction sites distributed over two areas of distinct climatic conditions : 1) hot and dry (arid) climate, and 2) hot and moist coastal climate. The in-situ strength of concrete was evaluated by strength testing of cores taken from slab, beam, and column elements. The curing methods were simulated by water sprinkling twice a day for 7 days with and without burlap cover. The strength results for cubes and cores so cured indicate that curing employing water sprinkling, twice a day, and without burlap cover is far below the ACI- 318 requirements. The results also indicate the need {{to account for the}} high variability of the strength ratio of <b>field</b> to standard <b>cured</b> concrete in the assessment of curing procedures specially in arid areas.

As these properties affect the hardened compressive strength and durability of concrete (resistance to freeze-thaw), the properties of workability (slump/flow), temperature, density and age are monitored to ensure the production and placement of 'quality' concrete. Depending on project location, tests are performed per ASTM International, European Committee for Standardization or Canadian Standards Association. As measurement of quality must represent the potential of concrete material delivered and placed, it is imperative that concrete technicians performing concrete tests are certified to do so according to these standards. Structural design, concrete material design and properties are often specified in accordance with national/regional design codes such as American Concrete Institute.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 150 - 153). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. High strength concrete (HSC) is regularly used for prestressed bridge girders in Texas and other states. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 363 (1997) defines HSC as concrete with a compressive strength exceeding 6, 000 psi (41 MPa) produced without using exotic materials or techniques. The design provisions for the design of prestressed concrete members according to the AASHTO Standard and LRFD Specifications are based on mechanical properties determined for normal strength concrete (NSC). Therefore, {{there is a need to}} evaluate these specifications based on the properties of HSC. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the allowable tensile stresses for HSC prestressed bridge girders. The effects of <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> conditions on the compressive strength and the flexural tensile strength of HSC were determined. The HSC mixtures tested in this study are representative of mixtures used in Phase 1 of this research program (Chompreda 2001). The plant-produced samples from the earlier study were lab cured after the first day (approximately 24 hours). Necessary strength adjustment factors are needed to account for the effect of <b>field</b> <b>curing</b> conditions. These factors were determined for representative HSC mixtures and applied to the compressive and flexural strength data from Phase 1 in order to evaluate the potential to increase the limiting allowable stresses.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the United States alfalfa makes up {{a large part of the}} winter ration of ruminants. It is {{necessary}} that livestock have adequate amounts of good quality roughage for feeding between pasture seasons. All too often the quality of alfalfa coming from storage fails to meet expectations. The quality and quantity of <b>field</b> <b>cured</b> alfalfa produced from a given field varies greatly. This depends on the stage of maturity of the crop when it is cut, the method of handling, its moisture content when stored and weather conditions during the harvest period. In some regions where alfalfa is grown, seasonal rains and occasional showers are quite prevalent throughout June and often into July. As a result of these seasonal rains, many farmers lose much of the nutritional value of their first cutting of alfalfa. The loss is mainly due to spoilage and leaching of the mowed hay in the field or due to cutting the alfalfa too late in maturity in an attempt to miss the seasonal rains. There is a need for more information on the merits of baling alfalfa at a higher moisture content than that normally accepted by most farmers. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the nutritive value of alfalfa hay baled at higher moisture contents than normally accepted as sound practice. There was the possibility of finding a moisture content which would not decrease the nutritive value of the hay, but decrease the time in which the hay would be exposed to the chance of environmental damage.

Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a ring feeder, precutting forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground.

40|$|Flavonoids are polyphenolic {{substances}} {{that are common}} in many {{fruits and vegetables and}} may have positive protective effects against e. g. cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. These effects have mainly been attributed to their antioxidative properties. One of the most common flavonoids in food plants is quercetin, of which yellow onion (Allium cepa L.) is one of our main dietary sources. The effects of cultivars, nitrogen fertiliser level, lifting time, curing, cultivation system and storage conditions on the quercetin content in yellow onion are investigated in this thesis. Analyses were performed using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction of raw onion samples in ethanol. The main determinant of quercetin level was found to be the amount of global solar radiation during the end of the bulbing phase in August. Annual variations in quercetin content were higher than any treatment effect within each year. Cultivar differences in quercetin levels were significant but inconsistent. Early lifting, when 50 % of the onions had fallen leaves, resulted in onions with better keeping quality and equal quercetin content compared with onions with later lifting times. Minimised split application of nitrogen fertilisers reduced the risk of mineral nutrient leaching without lowering the yield or quercetin content. <b>Field</b> <b>curing</b> generally resulted in significant increases in quercetin content compared with levels at lifting. The role of onion size for quercetin content was inconsistent but of minor importance. Quercetin levels were stable during cold storage at constant temperature. No {{significant differences were found between}} inorganically fertilised and organically fertilised onions of the same cultivar or between directly sown and transplanted onions. Quercetin content and soil water content within the field were not correlated...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic plane waves provide {{examples}} of time-dependent open string backgrounds free of α' corrections. The solvable case of open strings in a quadrupolar wave front, analogous to pp-waves for closed strings, is discussed. In light-cone gauge, {{it leads to}} non-conformal boundary conditions similar to those induced by tachyon condensates. A maximum electric gradient is found, at which macroscopic strings with vanishing tension are pair-produced [...] a non-relativistic analogue of the Born-Infeld critical electric field. Kinetic instabilities of quadrupolar electric <b>fields</b> are <b>cured</b> by standard atomic physics techniques, and do {{not interfere with the}} former dynamic instability. A new example of non-conformal open-closed duality is found. Propagation of open strings in time-dependent wave fronts is discussed.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of depth-sensing indentation as a characterization tool for high throughput experimentation (HTE) in the <b>field</b> of rubber <b>curing</b> was investigated. Depth-sensing indentation is a suitable candidate for HTE as small amts. of material per sample suffice and large nos. of samples can be automatically measured sequentially. The {{applicability of}} this technique to characterize rubber crosslinking was studied using a set of peroxide cured EPDM vulcanizates. Depth-sensing indentation results were correlated with state of cure, Shore A hardness and macroscopic mech. properties such as modulus and compression set. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
40|$|Many natural {{products}} found in plants exhibit {{a variety of}} biological activities including antibiotic, antitumor, and antiviral activities that have been utilized in the medicinal <b>field</b> to <b>cure</b> millions of people from serious diseases. Euphorbia hirta Linn. herb, a folkloric medicinal plant in the Philippines against dengue is reportedly effective against the dengue virus. This deadly and painful mosquito-born disease continuously affects millions of people worldwide for there are no commercially developed drugs or vaccines available. From the viewpoint of overcoming the dengue disease, the authors investigated the chemical components of Euphorbia hirta Linn. Preliminary anti-dengue assay by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) revealed that the ethyl acetate layer was the most active fraction and significantly reduced the plaque forming capacity of the dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 relative to the control. Further purification of the active ethyl acetate fraction afforded 6 known triterpene and 3 flavonoid compounds. The planar structures of these molecules were established by ESIMS and NMR spectroscopic analyses...|$|R
