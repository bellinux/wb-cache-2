5|$|Samson <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> {{honored in}} Russian artwork because the Russians {{defeated}} the Swedes in the Battle of Poltava on the feast day of St. Sampson, {{whose name is}} homophonous with Samson's. The lion slain by Samson was interpreted to represent Sweden, {{as a result of}} the lion's placement on the Swedish coat of arms. In 1735, C. B. Rastrelli's bronze statue of Samson slaying the lion was placed in the center of the great cascade of the fountain at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

25|$|To {{boost the}} {{market share of}} locally {{produced}} vehicles, the Russian government implemented several protectionist measures and launched programs to attract foreign producers into the country. In late 2005, the Russian leadership enacted legislation to create special economic zones (SEZ) {{with the aim of}} encouraging investments by foreign automotive companies. The benefits of operating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, exemption from asset and land taxes and protection against changes in the tax regime. Some regions also provide extensive support for large investors (over $100million.) These include Saint Petersburg/Leningrad Oblast (Toyota, GM, Nissan) and Kaluga Oblast (VW). Kaluga <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> successful in attracting foreign companies, as has been Kaliningrad Oblast.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{traditions are}} passed down through {{language}}, making language {{an important factor}} in the existence of biocultural diversity.

This decline <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> observed in indigenous languages, with a 60% decline in the Americas, 30% in the Pacific, and 20% in Africa. Currently, there are 7,000 languages being spoken in the world. Half the population speaks only 25 of these languages, the top 5 in order being Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi, and Bengali. The remaining 6975 languages are divided between the other half of the population.|$|E

Incidents have included kidnappings and executions; including those of police and local political figures as local criminal organizations ally themselves with rival Sinaloa and Gulf cartels fighting for dominance in the region. Petatlán <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> hard hit by the violence.

These checkpoints randomly search private and commercial vehicles, including tour busses.|$|E

Rossiter's work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>especially</b> significant as a framework for other scholars to build on. Not only in the English speaking world. Thus, Carmen Magallón acknowledges that it was the work of Margaret Rossiter what inspired her to research the experience of the Spanish Women pioneers in the sciences.|$|E
