50|$|Similar to a {{vertical}} screen scroll centrifuge, a horizontal screen scroll centrifuge is constructed of several main parts: screen, scroll, basket, housing, and helical screw. The screen and the basket with <b>frustoconical</b> geometry are assembled into the housing in a horizontal axis. Inside the <b>frustoconical</b> structure {{there is a}} tubular wall. Inside the tubular wall there is a cylinder of helical screw which flight on scroll pass. The tubular wall will have a slightly different angular speed to the helical screw.|$|E
50|$|Screen scroll {{centrifuge}} is a filtering centrifuge which separates solids {{and liquid}} from a solid-liquid mixture. This type of centrifuge {{is commonly used}} with a continuous process in which slurry containing both solid and liquid is continuously fed into and continuously discharged from the centrifuge. In a typical screen scroll centrifuge, the basic principle is that entering feed is separated into liquid and solids as two products. The feed is transported from small to larger diameter end of <b>frustoconical</b> basket by the inclination of the screen basket and slightly different speed of the scraper worm. The solid material retained on the screen is moved along the cone via an internal screw conveyor while the liquid output is obtained due to centrifugal force causes the feed slurry {{to pass through the}} screen openings. Furthermore, screen scroll centrifuge may rotate either in horizontal or vertical position.|$|E
40|$|A {{friction}} pull plug {{is provided}} {{for use in}} forming a plug weld in a hole in a material. The friction pull plug includes a shank {{and a series of}} three <b>frustoconical</b> sections. The relative sizes of the sections assure that a central one of the sections defines the initial contact point between the hole's sides. The angle defined by the central one of the sections reduces or eliminates chatter as the plug is pulled into the hole...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} {{we attempted to}} clarify the particular bronze vascular forms herein defined recipienti troncoconici ad ansa sormontante (“over vase loop handled <b>frustoconical</b> vessels”), often called mug, caccabus or kettle. Through a morphological analysis of the bronze vessel we proposed a hypothesized purpose of infusion or sauce preparation or a spiced wine container. The contextual analysis {{made it possible to}} date the articles between the mid-third and half of the second century BC, although some clues can extend the upper limit {{toward the end of the}} fourth century BC. The data context also allowed to suggest the site of Capena as production centre, since 31 of the 67 specimens come from the neighboring necropoles...|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} piston {{structure is}} disclosed {{which provides a}} simple and reliable means for joining a carbon-carbon or ceramic piston cap with a metallic piston body. Attachment is achieved {{by means of a}} special geometry which compensates for differences in thermal expansion without complicated mechanical fastening devices. The shape employs a flange created by opposed <b>frustoconical</b> shapes with coincident vertices intersecting on the radial centerline of the piston in order to retain the piston cap. The use of carbon-carbon for the piston cap material allows a close fit between the piston and a cylinder wall, eliminating the need for piston rings. The elimination of extra mechanical parts of previous composite pistons provides a lightweight composite piston capable of extended high temperature operation...|$|E
40|$|A constant-output {{atomizer}} {{includes a}} body {{which has a}} generally <b>frustoconical</b> expansion nozzle for producing an air jet when a supply of pressurized air {{is connected to the}} nozzle upstream of the throat of the nozzle. A liquid feed line supplies liquid to be atomized by the air jet, and the body includes a groove which opens into the diffuser section of the nozzle downstream of the throat for conducting liquid from the feed line to the nozzle. The groove which extends in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the nozzle, and radially with respect to it, has a depth approximately equal to half the axial length of the nozzle. Liquid, conducted by capillary action in the groove to the nozzle, is atomized into a fine mist by the air jet in the nozzle; and the groove eliminates fluctuations in spray order...|$|E
40|$|A strip imaging {{wide angle}} optical system is {{provided}}. The optical system {{is provided with}} a 'virtual' material stop to avoid aberrational effects inherent in wide angle optical systems. The optical system includes a spherical mirror section for receiving light from a 180 deg strip or arc of a target image. Light received by the spherical mirror section is reflected to a <b>frustoconical</b> mirror section for subsequent rereflection to a row of optical fibers. Each optical fiber transmits {{a portion of the}} received light to a detector. The optical system exploits the narrow cone of acceptance associated with optical fibers to substantially eliminate vignetting effects inherent in wide angle systems. Further, the optical system exploits the narrow cone of acceptance of the optical fibers to substantially limit spherical aberration. The optical system is ideally suited for any application wherein a 180 deg strip image need be detected, and is particularly well adapted for use in hostile environments such as in planetary exploration...|$|E
40|$|A {{surgical}} tissue macerating {{and removal}} tool is described {{which has a}} rotating rod with a cutting member {{at one end and}} which disposed in a tube which is then contained in an extension of the tool handle. A frusto-conical member extends into the extension at the cutter member end of the rotating rod with its small end engaging the tube. The portion of the frusto-conical member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging member and may be cut-off at an angle to the axis of the rod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-concial member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space between the tube and the extension may flow to the operative site. An aperture is provided in the <b>frustoconical</b> member between the extension and the tube so that fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes with macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied to help remove macerated material...|$|E

The other side of the core has a plurality of concentric annular first slots and a plurality of annular concentric second slots alternating with the first slots, the second slots having a greater depth than said first slots. A bore extends through the core for inletting a second liquid into said core, the bore intersecting the second slots to feed the second liquid into the second slots. The core also has a plurality of first passageways leading from the manifold to the first annular slots for feeding the first liquid into said first slots. A faceplate brazed to said other side of the core is provided with apertures extending from the first and second slots through said face plate, these apertures being positioned to direct fuel and liquid oxygen into contact with each other in the combustion chamber. The first liquid may be liquid oxygen and the second liquid may be kerosene or liquid hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{literature}} review {{piece by piece}} methods of round wood measurements employed in different countries are briefly discussed. The main working method of upper diameter (STB 1667 - 2012, GOST 2708 – 75) was researched (in comparison with the control data of formulas Smaliana and a truncated cone). An analysis of round wood volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 in comparison with control data showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in standard volumes (GOST 2708 – 75) (up to 13 % for medium-sized (24 cm) and large (over 24 cm) round wood). However, for logs with taper coefficient more than 1 cm/m) negative deviations are characterized, which, in turn, suggests an underestimation of wood volume in the standard tables {{in relation to the}} control data of formulas Smaliana and truncated cone (– 18 %). Formula Smaliana versus <b>frustoconical</b> formula underestimates the timber volume (however, not more than 1 %). Obviously, both of these formulas can be used to determine the amount of measurement errors by the method of upper diameter. In our view, it is advisable to clarify the method of upper diameter based on the average value of taper coefficient in stacked batches of round wood (entering of amendments to the volumes from GOST 2708 – 75 on a log taper coefficient of real value) ...|$|E
