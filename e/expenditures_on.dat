40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to investigate the relationships between different factors affecting educational competitiveness, which is crucial to enhancing national competitiveness in every country, and to put forward policy implications whereby each country may raise the level of its educational competitiveness. PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland.

Model 3 is a configuration of five variables (low total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, low total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of students to teaching staff, and high GDP), and includes Japan.
