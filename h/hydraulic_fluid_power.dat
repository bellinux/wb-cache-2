There are two main variations; external gear pumps which use two external spur gears, and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution.

Mainly dynamic forces in bearings are the source causing structure-borne noise which generates finally air-borne noise. For this reason, those dynamic forces have been investigated based on a dynamical model. The structure borne noise has been measured on the pump case surface. The natural vibrations of the pump case have been determined by the Finite Element Method for several boundary conditions. The comparison between calculated and measured natural vibrations indicates that the coupling of the pump parts influences the dynamic behaviour of the case...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} design methodologies {{for construction}} of an actuator that uses smart materials to provide <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>power.</b> In the class of actuators described, hydraulic fluid decouples the operating frequency of the output cylinder from the drive frequency of the piezoelectric or other smart material. This decoupling allows the piezoelectric to be driven at high frequency, to extract {{the maximum amount of}} energy from the material, and the hydraulic cylinder to be driven at low frequencies to provide long stroke. However, due to fluid compressibility and structural compliance, the fundamental impedance match between the fluid and the piezoelectric make it difficult to convert energy from the piezoelectric into pressurized hydraulic fluid flow. The basic design tradeoffs and major technical issues are discussed in the areas of materials, mechanical design, and fluid-mechanical interface. Prototype devices and component measurements are presented. Test methods are described, and test results quantifying pump pressure and flow, and actuator force and velocity are summarized. The series of tests show the potential of these devices for high force long stroke devices powered by smart materials...|$|E

This paper proposes a systematic approach {{to simulate the}} vibroacoustic characteristics of an axial piston pump using a hybrid lumped parameters/finite element/boundary element (LP/FE/BE) model, and large amount of experimental work was performed to validate the model. The LP model was developed to calculate the excitation forces and was validated by a comparison of outlet flow ripples. The FE model was developed to calculate the vibration of the pump, in which the modeling of main friction pairs using different spring elements was presented in detail, and the FE model was validated using experimental modal analysis and measured vibrations. The BE model was {{used to calculate the}} noise emitted from the pump, and a measurement of sound pressure level at representative field points in a hemianechoic chamber was conducted to validate the BE model. Comparisons between the simulated and measured results show that the developed LP/FE/BE model is effective in capturing the vibroacoustic characteristics of the pump.

40|$|A three-magnet array {{unilateral}} NMR sensor with {{a homogeneous}} sensitive spot was employed for assessing {{aging of the}} turbine oils used in two different power stations. The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence and Inversion Recovery-prepared CPMG were employed for measuring the 1 H-NMR transverse and longitudinal relaxation times of turbine oils with different service status. Two signal components with different lifetimes were obtained by processing the transverse relaxation curves with a numeric program based on the Inverse Laplace Transformation. The long lifetime components of the transverse relaxation time T 2 eff and longitudinal relaxation time T 1 were chosen to monitor the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> aging. The results demonstrate that an increase of the service time of the turbine oils clearly results in a decrease of T 2 eff,long and T 1,long.

40|$|The {{reduction}} or {{elimination of}} leakage of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> from <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> systems {{is considered a}} fundamental prerequisite for the expanded use of <b>fluid</b> <b>power.</b> There is also a need to reduce seal friction to both reduce energy dissipation and eliminate control problems. These seals are developed through empirical means at the present time, since the fundamental physics of seal operation has been unclear. This research develops numerical models for analyzing reciprocating hydraulic rod seals with various rod surfaces. These models consist of coupled fluid mechanics, contact mechanics and deformation analyses. Both flooded and starved lubrication boundary conditions are applied. For seals with a smooth rod and a plunge-ground rod, the model combines a 1 -D finite volume Reynolds equation solver with a 2 -D axisymmetric finite element deformation and static contact mechanics analyses, and a Greenwood-Williamson contact mechanics analysis with rod motion. Leakage and friction, along with sealing zone details with the plunge-ground rod are compared with those with the smooth rod.

This model is able to handle rod surface pattern with 3 -dimensional geometrics. Simulations with different micro-pattern geometries are performed to analyze the fundamental mechanism of surface pattern effects on seal operation.
