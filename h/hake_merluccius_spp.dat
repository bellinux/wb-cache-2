40|$|Introduction: Diurnal {{variation}} is observed {{in almost all}} marine surveys and can cause biased abundance and length frequency estimates. Symmetric logistic models developed by Hjellvik et al. (2001) were utilized to investigate diurnal variation in catch rates of <b>hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.)</b> of trawlers for the period 1997 - 2002 and of hake surveys (1990 - 2003) in Namibian waters. The large numbers of commercial tows {{have a very good}} geographical, seasonal and temporal resolution that enabled us to study the influence of various explanatory variables on diurnal fluctuation model parameters. These results were thereby used to facilitate the modelling of diurnal variation in Namibian hake trawl survey catches...|$|E

The seabed environment is described and nekton associations with substratum features are identified. The area is characterized by heterogeneity to its physical and biological struture. The variety of observed nekton is low, and communities are dominated by goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, juvenile <b>hake</b> <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> and cuttlefish Sepia spp. (on soft substrata), as well as false jacopever Sebastes capensis and kingklip Genypterus capensis (on rocky substrata). ...|$|E
40|$|The South African {{midwater}} trawl fishery targets adult horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis) on the Agulhas Bank. The {{bulk of the}} catch is taken by a single {{midwater trawl}}er. The bycatch of this fishery is investigated by analysing observer records from 2004 to 2014 to report on bycatch composition, volumes and temporal and spatial patterns. Small fauna were analysed by extrapolation of sample weights and large fauna were counted. The midwater trawl fishery was estimated to have caught 25 415 t annually, with a bycatch rate of 6. 9 % of the total catch, by weight. Bycatch species with the highest average annual catches were chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), redeye roundherring (Etrumeus whiteheadi), ribbonfish (Lepidopus caudatus) and <b>hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.).</b> Large fauna bycatch species included Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus), sharks (15 species), sunfish (Mola mola) and cetaceans (two species). Temporal analysis revealed significant differences between day-time and night-time CPUE for nine species, and significant differences in seasonal CPUE for 17 species. Spatial analysis of small fauna species composition and of large fauna species composition identified three groups in each. The 100 % observer coverage is high compared to other South African fisheries, and, although the average sampling rate of 1. 56 % is low, {{an increase in the}} sampling rate might not be feasible owing to the size of catches. The bycatch rate in this fishery is low compared to other South African trawl fisheries but similar to global midwater trawl bycatch rates. There are species overlaps with various fisheries, namely the demersal trawl, small pelagic, linefishery, shark longline and squid fisheries, yet the total catch estimates from this fishery are generally small relative to catches taken in the target fisheries...|$|E
40|$|We {{synthesise}} {{and update}} {{results from the}} suite of biophysical, larval-dispersal models developed in the Benguela Current ecosystem. Biophysical models of larval dispersal use outputs of physical hydrodynamic models as inputs to individual-based models in which biological processes acting during the larval life are included. In the Benguela, such models were first applied to simulate the dispersal of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax ichthyoplankton, and more recently of the early life stages of chokka-squid Loligo reynaudii and Cape <b>hakes</b> <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> We identify how the models have helped advance understanding of key processes for these species.

GPS telemetry {{in conjunction}} with a recent diet time series and historical dietary informationwas used in this study to obtain novel insight into the dietary trends and feeding ecology of Cape gannets Morus capensis on the Namibian islands. particularly Ichaboe and Mercury. The gannet diet has changed substantially since the 1950 s. refiecting spatio-temporal changes in the availability of commercially important pelagic prey species. The more recent diet time series for Ichaboe Island (Nov 1995 to Feb 2004) showed that trawler scavenged <b>hakes</b> <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp</b> and naturally foraged saury Scomberesox saw'us dominated the diet by both contribution to mass (35 and 34 %, respectively) and frequency of occurrence (34 and 25 %, respectively). In a significant contrast, juvenile horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis (40 % mass, 26 % frequency) and juvenile snoek Thyrsites atun (20 % mass, 20 % frequency) were the two main prey species at Mercury Island during Oct 1996 to Feb 2004. Multivariate analysis of data showed significant time and site effects in diet composition between Ichaboe and Mercury for the period Nov 1996 to Mar 1999. Twenty-five and 15 GPS field deployments were made on birds at Ichaboe and Mercury, respectively, during the 2003 / 4 breeding season. Birds from both locations showed significant differences in their foraging patterns. Birds from Ichaboe had shorter foraging trips (24. 3 hrs vs 29. 4 hrs),traveled shorter distances away from their island (130 km vs 197 km) and had shorter foraging path lengths (422 km vs 673 km). Birds from Ichaboe foraged in two dominant directions: west. to obtain mainly scavenged fish offal, and north to obtain forage fish. Mercury birds foraged only north, overlapping their foraging zone with birds from Ichaboe in a northerly direction, between 25. 8 ° Sand 24. 4 ° S. Birds at all colonies - especially in the south - appear to be constrained by lower quality food and generally poor feeding conditions which seem to be a limiting factor...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Fisheries {{can affect}} non-target species through bycatch, {{and climate change}} may act simultaneously on their population dynamics. Estimating the relative impact of fisheries and climate on non-target species remains a challenge for many populations because the spatio-temporal distribution of individuals remains poorly known and available demographic information is incomplete. 2. We used population survey data, capture–mark–recapture methods, population modelling and the demographic invariant method to investigate the effects of climate and fisheries on the demography of a predator species affected by bycatch. These complementary approaches were used to help account for different sources of uncertainty. 3. The white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis is the commonest seabird species killed by longline fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Petrel breeding success {{was positively related to}} the fishing effort for Patagonian toothfish Dissosticus eleginoides. El Niño events negatively affected adult survival with a time lag of 3 years. Fishing efforts for toothfish and <b>hake</b> (<b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.)</b> were negatively related to petrel recruitment, suggesting that fisheries-induced mortality strongly impacted younger age classes. Lambda estimated from matrix population models was below replacement (0 · 964 ± 0 · 026), and the number of breeding pairs declined by ≈ 37 % in 21 years. This decline was probably caused by low survival of both young age classes and adults. 4. The Crozet archipelago, Southern Indian Ocean, population size was estimated at ≈ 170 000 individuals in the early 1980 s, and would be severely affected by any additional source of mortality that approached 8000 individuals per year. The number of petrels killed by the toothfish fishery alone exceeded this threshold during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, but has declined well below this since 2003. 5. Synthesis and applications. Complementary approaches suggest that both longline fishery bycatch and climate {{have a significant impact on}} the size of the Southern Ocean white-chinned petrel population. Stopping or reversing climate change will be a very slow process, and may be impossible. Therefore, we recommend a reduction in bycatch to help the populations recover. Further information on the status of individuals caught in longlines is required to understand the demographic processes involved...|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of the egg and larval abundance of <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> in the Benguela Jet Current was analysed. The Cape hakes, occurring in waters off South Africa, are important for the commercial fisheries in the southern Benguela system, but information on their early life-history strategy is sparse. Data and samples, for this study, were collected during bimonthly cruises of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Project (SARP) from August 1995 to July 2003. Samples were collected with a mini-bongo net (300  µm mesh) on a transect crossing the Benguela Current off the Cape Peninsula at 34. 15 °S, 18. 29 °E extending 58  nm offshore. Eggs and larvae were commonly found in currents with north-westerly flow, suggesting that the Benguela Jet Current transports eggs and larvae of <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> to the northern nursery areas. Spawning grounds of <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> appeared {{to be on the}} western Agulhas Bank during August 1996 to July 1998. Two possible spawning grounds in different water depths were identified, suggesting spawning by both Cape hake species, M. capensis and M. paradoxus. Peak abundances of eggs and larvae of <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> were found from June to October, a time of reduced offshore transport. Abundances of eggs and larvae were low in austral summer and autumn. Spawning intensity was higher during times of reduced upwelling as shown by correlations of abundances of early life stages with the upwelling index. This leads to the assumption that the early life-history strategy of <b>Merluccius</b> <b>spp.</b> is well adapted to the variability in upwelling intensity...|$|R
