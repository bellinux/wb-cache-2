5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily <b>deducible</b> by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.|$|E
5|$|The first {{atomic bombs}} were {{developed}} by the wartime Manhattan Project. This {{was carried out in}} secret, lest its discovery induce the Axis powers, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects, or undertake covert operations against the project. The military and scientific leaders of the Manhattan Project anticipated a need to release details of their wartime accomplishments, principally as a form of recognition for the participants who had labored in secrecy. Press releases were prepared in advance of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and an official account, known as the Smyth Report after its author, the physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth, was commissioned in April 1944 to provide a history of the project for public release. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie Groves, his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman, and Smyth agreed that information could be publicly released if it was essential for an understanding of the project, or was already generally known or <b>deducible,</b> or had no significance to the production of atomic bombs. The first copies went on sale on August 12, 1945.|$|E
25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, and I believe that this theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be <b>deducible</b> as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is <b>deducible</b> from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is <b>deducible</b> from statistical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is <b>deducible</b> from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any {{assignment}} of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory.|$|E
25|$|Data mining {{requires}} {{data preparation}} which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data <b>deducible</b> or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.|$|E
25|$|Antonio's {{parents were}} Alessandro Stradivari, son of Giulio Cesare Stradivari, and Anna Moroni, {{daughter}} of Leonardo Moroni. They married on 30 August 1622, and {{had at least}} three children between 1623 and 1628: Giuseppe Giulia Cesare, Carlo Felice, and Giovanni Battista. The baptismal records of the parish of S. Prospero then stop, and it is unknown whether they had any children from 1628 to 1644. This blank in the records {{may be due to}} the family leaving Cremona in response to war, famine, and plague in the city from 1628 to 1630, or the records may have been lost due to clerical reforms imposed by Joseph II of Austria in 1788. The latter explanation is supported by the word Cremonensis (of Cremona) on many of Stradivari's labels, which suggests that he was born in the city instead of merely moving back there to work. Antonio was born in 1644, a fact <b>deducible</b> from later violins. However, there are no records or information available on his early childhood, and the first evidence of his presence in Cremona is the label of his oldest surviving violin from 1666.|$|E

2500|$|The {{converse}} can {{be proven}} as well: if a formula always has the value 1, {{then it is}} <b>deducible</b> from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the intuitionistically valid formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This {{is similar to the}} notion that classically valid formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the two-element Boolean algebra under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula's variables [...] that is, they are formulas which are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to 'true'. The usual two-valued logic system is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false).|$|E
2500|$|German {{academic}} Michael Maar's book The Two Lolitas {{describes his}} recent {{discovery of a}} 1916 German short story titled [...] "Lolita" [...] whose middle-aged narrator describes travelling abroad as a student. He takes a room as a lodger and instantly becomes obsessed with the preteen girl (also named Lolita) {{who lives in the}} same house. Maar has speculated that Nabokov may have had cryptomnesia ("hidden memory") while he was composing Lolita during the 1950s. Maar says that until 1937 Nabokov lived in the same section of Berlin as the author, Heinz von Eschwege (pen name: Heinz von Lichberg), and was most likely familiar with his work, which was widely available in Germany during Nabokov's time there. The Philadelphia Inquirer, in the article [...] "Lolita at 50: Did Nabokov take literary liberties?" [...] says that, according to Maar, accusations of plagiarism should not apply and quotes him as saying: [...] "Literature has always been a huge crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast... Nothing of what we admire in Lolita is already {{to be found in the}} tale; the former is in no way <b>deducible</b> from the latter." [...] See also Jonathan Lethem's essay [...] "The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism" [...] in Harper's Magazine on this story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} Gödel and Tarski {{dominate}} the 1930s, a crucial {{period in the}} development of metamathematics – the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce metatheories, or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. [...] Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert's program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of Gödel, who in 1929 showed that a given first-order sentence is <b>deducible</b> if and only if it is logically valid – i.e. it is true in every structure for its language. [...] This is known as Gödel's completeness theorem. [...] A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form. [...] The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure such as an algorithm or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the natural numbers. [...] For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself. [...] These two results are known as Gödel's incompleteness theorems, or simply Gödel's Theorem. [...] Later in the decade, Gödel developed the concept of set-theoretic constructibility, as part of his proof that the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are consistent with Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.|$|E
2500|$|The phenomenalist {{phase of}} post-Humean {{empiricism}} ended by the 1940s, for {{by that time}} it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. [...] If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former {{must be at least}} <b>deducible</b> from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. [...] But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} Rabbi Eliezer, {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose, said that he refuted the sectarian books that {{maintained}} that resurrection is not <b>deducible</b> from the Torah. To support {{the proposition that the}} Torah does refer to the resurrection of the dead, Rabbi Eliezer cited [...] which says, [...] "Because he has despised the word of the Lord, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off ( [...] , hikareit tikareit); his iniquity shall be upon him." [...] Rabbi Eliezer reasoned that as this person would be utterly be cut off in this world (meaning that he would die), the person's iniquity would need to be upon him in the next world (in the life after death). Rav Papa asked Abaye whether Rabbi Eliezer could not have deduced both this world and the next from the words [...] "he shall be utterly cut off." [...] The answer was that they would have replied that the Torah employed human phraseology. Similarly, the Tannaim disputed: Rabbi Akiva taught that the words, [...] "That soul shall utterly be cut off ( [...] , hikareit)," [...] mean that he shall be cut off in this world and ( [...] , tikareit) in the next. Rabbi Ishmael noted that [...] previously stated, [...] "he reproaches the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off," [...] and asked whether Rabbi Akiva's reasoning thus implied the existence of three words. Rather, Rabbi Ishmael taught that the words of [...] "and [...] shall be cut off," [...] imply in this world, whereas the words of [...] "be cut off ( [...] , hikareit)," [...] imply in the next world. As for the repetition in [...] ( [...] , tikareit), Rabbi Ishmael attributed that to the Torah's use of human phraseology. The Gemara taught that both Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva utilize the concluding words of [...] "his iniquity shall be upon him," [...] for the purpose taught in a Baraita: One might think that the sinner would be cut off even if the sinner repented. Therefore, [...] says, [...] "his iniquity is upon him," [...] meaning that God decreed that the sinner shall be cut off only if the sinner's iniquity is still in him (and the sinner dies unrepentant)..
