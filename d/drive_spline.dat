40|$|A {{case study}} of a {{high-speed}} seal test rotor shows how rotor dynamic analysis {{can be used to}} diagnose the source of high vibrations and evaluate a proposed remedy. Experimental results are compared with the synchronous and non-synchronous whirl response analysis of a double overhung, high-speed seal test rotor with ball bearings supported in 5. 84 - and 12. 7 -mm-long, un-centered squeeze-film oil dampers. Test performance with the original damper of length 5. 84 mm was marginal. Non-synchronous whirling occurred at the overhung seal test disk and there was a high amplitude synchronous response near the <b>drive</b> <b>spline</b> above 32, 000 rpm. Nonlinear synchronous unbalance and time transient whirl studies were conducted on the seal test rotor with the original and extended damper lengths. With the original damper design, the nonlinear synchronous response showed that unbalance could cause damper lockup at 33, 000 rpm. Alford cross-coupling forces were also included at the overhung seal test disk for the whirl analysis. Sub-synchronous whirling at the seal test disk was observed in the nonlinear time transient analysis. With the extended damper length of 12. 7 mm, the sub-synchronous motion was eliminated and the rotor unbalance response was acceptable to 45, 000 rpm with moderate rotor unbalance. Seal test rotor orbits and vibration levels with the extended squeeze film dampers showed smooth operation to 40, 444 rpm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental behavior and dynamic {{analysis of a}} high speed test rig with rolling element bearings mounted in squeeze film oil damper bearings. The test rotor is a double overhung configuration with rolling element ball bearings mounted in uncentered squeeze-film oil dampers. The damper design {{is similar to that}} employed with various high-speed aircraft HP gas turbines. The dynamic performance of the test rig with the originally installed dampers with an effective damper length of length 0. 23 -inch was unacceptable. The design speed of 40, 000 RPM could not be safely achieved as nonsynchronous whirling at the overhung seal test disk and high amplitude critical speed response at the <b>drive</b> <b>spline</b> section occurred at 32, 000 RPM. In addition to the self excited stability and critical speed problems, it was later seen from FFT data analysis, that a region of supersynchronous dead band whirling occurs between 10, 000 to 15, 000 RPM which can lead to bearing distress and wear. The system was analyzed using both linear and nonlinear techniques. The extended length damper design resulting from the analysis eliminated the rotor subsynchronous whirling, high amplitude critical speed, and the dead band whirling region allowing the system to achieve a speed of 45, 000 RPM. However, nonlinear analysis shows that damper lockup could occur with high rotor unbalance at 33, 000 RPM, even with the extended squeeze-film dampers. The control of damper lockup will be addressed in a future paper...|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{studies are}} common {{because they provide}} more {{information}} about the evolutions of the underlying system. With the advance of technology, high frequency data can be collected from the studied subjects and how to balance the flexibility and interpretability in extracting the information from the individual profiles is the key challenge. In literature, linear mixed effects models have clear interpretations but only limited flexibility. Functional mixed effects models, on the other hand, are extremely flexible but the results are hard to interpret. To simultaneously obtain flexibility and interpretability, this dissertation utilizes state space method as the basic unit of data analysis. We first develop a data <b>driven</b> <b>spline</b> smoothing method by extending the classical smoothing spline to allow the roughness to adapt to the underlying signal. We also propose an equivalent state space model to ease to computational demand. We then develop a new class of mixed effects model where state space method is used to specify both the population effects and individual effects. The resultant models can handle a wide range of individual profiles and have clear interpretation. We further extend the mixed effects state space models to study various types of relationships across multivariate outcomes. The proposed methods are motivated by and applied to two data sets: (1) adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol from a study of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome: and (2) the electroencephalogram data from epilepsy patients. ...|$|R

5000|$|The spline {{is often}} {{manufactured}} with parallel ridges {{running along the}} length of the spline to provide a better grip and compliance when it is pressed into the channel. A spline roller [...] - [...] a special tool that consists of a metal (or plastic) wheel on a handle [...] - [...] is used to press the spline into the frame. The wheel edge is concave, to help it hold the spline and not slip off to the side. Some spline rollers are double-ended and have both convex and concave rollers; the convex roller can be used to seat the spline deeper into the channel without risk of cutting the screen. <b>Driving</b> the <b>spline</b> into the channel tends to tension the screen on the frame, so the installer must avoid pre-tensioning the screen excessively to prevent the frame from becoming warped.|$|R

50|$|Truvativ's {{approach}} is an {{evolution of the}} ISIS Drive bottom bracket. The spindle is made longer, and the bearings sit outside the bottom bracket shell. The spindle is permanently pressed into the right crank. The left side spline interface looks similar, but is different so as to prevent installation of older ISIS Drive crankarms—which are no longer compatible because Q-factor and chainline can not be maintained using these older cranks with an external bearing BB. They refer to this design as 'Giga-X-Pipe' or 'GXP.' They also make a heavier duty external bearing bottom bracket called 'Howitzer.' The Howitzer BB {{is more like a}} traditional BB in that the spindle is not permanently pressed into the right crank. Again, the Howitzer spline looks similar to the ISIS <b>Drive</b> standard <b>spline</b> but is actually different, so as to prevent the usage of ISIS Drive cranks on the external bearing BB, which would affect chainline and Q-factor.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a fundamental}} {{investigation of a}} noisy commercial <b>spline</b> <b>driven</b> disc brake using thermal and holographic techniques. A thermal camera is used to observe heat distribution within the sliding fist type brake system during a heavy braking situation. It is seen that the disc appears to exhibit localised hot areas and the pad is seen to vary in temperature along its length, it being hotter at the leading edge. Observations of the pad face after heavy braking gives some indication of the pressure distribution across its face during this operation. Interrogation of one image is able to indicate temperature variation across the hub region, even the splines being identified within the temperature profile. A friction material with an artificially high coefficient of friction was used to promote noise. The whole body visual technique of holographic interferometry is used to investigate the modes of vibration of the principal component parts, mirrors being used to allow visual access to otherwise hidden areas. Holograms of the main vibrating components are presented and discussed. The images indicate the vibrational characteristics of the commercial brake {{are similar to those}} of a car brake and that positive cross-correlation of information may be a possibility.

5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 <b>spline</b> <b>drives</b> specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R
40|$|In many {{rotating}} machinery applications, such as helicopters, the splines of an externally-splined steel shaft {{that emerges from}} the gearbox engage with the reverse geometry of an internally <b>splined</b> <b>driven</b> shaft for the delivery of power. The splined section of the shaft is a critical and non-redundant element which is prone to cracking due to complex loading conditions. Thus, early detection of flaws is required to prevent catastrophic failures. The acoustic emission (AE) method is a direct way of detecting such active flaws, but its application to detect flaws in a splined shaft in a gearbox is difficult due to the interference of background noise and uncertainty {{about the effects of}} the wave propagation path on the received AE signature. Here, to model how AE may detect fault propagation in a hollow cylindrical splined shaft, the splined section is essentially unrolled into a metal plate of the same thickness as the cylinder wall. Spline ridges are cut into this plate, a through-notch is cut perpendicular to the spline to model fatigue crack initiation, and tensile cyclic loading is applied parallel to the spline to propagate the crack. In this paper, the new piezoelectric sensor array is introduced with the purpose of placing them within the gearbox to minimize the wave propagation path. The fatigue crack growth of a notched and flattened gearbox spline component is monitored using a new piezoelectric sensor array and conventional sensors in a laboratory environment with the purpose of developing source models and testing the new sensor performance. The AE data is continuously collected together with strain gauges strategically positioned on the structure. A significant amount of continuous emission due to the plastic deformation accompanied with the crack growth is observed. The frequency spectra of continuous emissions and burst emissions are compared to understand the differences of plastic deformation and sudden crack jump. The correlation of the cumulative AE events at the notch tip and the strain data is used to predict crack growth. The performance of the new sensor array is compared with the conventional AE sensors in terms of signal to noise ratio and the ability to detect fatigue cracking...|$|R
40|$|The {{displacement}} and {{deformation of}} brain tissue {{is a major}} source of error in image-guided neurosurgery systems. This thesis presents the design, implementation and validation of an image registration algortithm to detect and correct brain-shift using pre-operative MR images and intraoperative Doppler ultrasound data. The registration algorithm uses segmented vessels from both modalities, and estimates the displacement using {{a modified version of the}} iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The least trimmed squares (LTS) was used to reduce the number of outliers in the point matching procedure. The selected points were first used to estimate a linear transformation between the two data-sets, and then used to <b>drive</b> a thin-plate <b>spline</b> transform to achieve non-linear registration. A deformable brain phantom was designed, constructed and characterized in order to serve as a gold standard in the validation of the registration algorithm. The reproducibility of the elastic deformation of the phantom was evaluated using MR imaging and surface measurements. The experiments showed that the phantom was well suited for MR and ultrasound imaging (B-mode and Doppler) with sub-millimeter reproducibility for the deformations. Validation of the registration technique was then completed in three parts. First, the technique was tested and validated using realistic simulations where the results were compared to the known deformation. The registration technique recovered 75 % of the deformation in the region of interest accounting for deformations as large as 20 mm. Second, a phantom study was performed where both MR and ultrasound images of the phantom were obtained for three different deformations. The registration results based on MR data were used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of the ultrasound based registration. On average, deformations of 7. 5 mm magnitude were corrected to within 1. 6 mm for the ultrasound based registration and 1. 07 mm for the MR based registration. Finally, the registration algorithm was validated using five retrospective clinical data-sets. Because the true displacement remained unknown, the method was validated using homologous landmarks identified in the original data, the exclusion of selected vessels, and finally manual segmentation of non-vascular structures in anatomical data. The tracking of homologous landmarks show that the registration algorithm was able to correct the deformation to within 1. 24 mm, and the validation using excluded vessels and anatomical structures show an accuracy close to 1 mm. Pre-processing of the data can be completed in 30 seconds per dataset, and registrations can be performed in less than 30 seconds. This makes the technique well suited for intra-operative use...|$|R
