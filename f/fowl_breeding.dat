40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the genetic parameters influencing egg quality in Khorasan Razavi native fowl. (Co) Variance components were estimated by the Bayesian statistical method via Gibbs sampling in GIBBS 3 F 90 software. 1000 eggs (28 - 29 weeks old) were collected from 775 hens of the ninth generation of Khorasan-Razavi Province native <b>fowl</b> <b>breeding</b> center. External (egg weight,specific gravity, long length, short length, shape index, shell strength, shell weight, shell thickness) and internal (yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk weight, yolk index, albumen diameter, albumen height, albumen weight, albumen index, Haugh unit) egg quality traits were measured. Six univariate animal models were used for estimation of genetic parameters and the best model for each trait was determined by deviance information criterion (DIC). Genetic and phenotypic correlations between traits were estimated using bivariate animal model. Direct heritability estimates ranged from 0. 10 (egg width) to 0. 39 (yolk index). For all traits except albumen diameter and albumen index, the inclusion of maternal effects in the model resulted in considerable reduction in direct heritability. Genetic correlations of egg weight with shell strength and shell thickness were negative. In conclusion, due to genetic correlations among external and internal egg quality traits, selection based on egg weight and shell thickness may improve external and internal egg quality traits. Also, including maternal effects in the form of genetic or permanent environment in the statistical model resulted in more accurate estimates for most traits...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} emphasis on understanding the breeding biology of domestic fowl, turkeys and duck {{but not of}} the other commercially significant species, such as ratites, gamebirds, guinea fowl and pigeons. In general, our understanding of breeding in these species is poor relative to that of commercial poultry. The only exception is the ostrich, {{which has been the}} subject of numerous studies of breeding behaviour, fertility and incubation, both in the wild and in captivity. Other ratite species have received less attention. Despite the economic importance of gamebirds in Europe and North America, especially pheasant and partridge, studies on reproduction in these species are mainly limited to a few investigations into factors affecting fertility. Improving our understanding of guinea <b>fowl</b> <b>breeding</b> would greatly assist in maximizing production in its native Africa. Of the species described in this chapter, the pigeon is of note because its pattern of reproduction is reliant on long-term pairing of birds and their role in the rearing of the altricial offspring. The paucity of information made it difficult to derive general trends between species in their reproductive biology. However, it was clear that to maximize productivity many of these species of birds needed to be kept as pairs or at least in small groups. This contrasts with industrial poultry production, where group sizes are typically in the thousands. Another aspect of the breeding biology of these minor species is a general lack of breeding technology, e. g. artificial insemination, in egg production.

The research evaluated the potential production of prominent commercial cultivars under various levels of moisture stress, the adaptability of 10 major soil series to the utilization of sprinkler irrigation, and the use of adjuvants to increase the infiltration on one low infiltration soil. Some cultivars did exhibit resistance defined as sustained production under reduced water supply. However, these cultivars were not the most productive. The cultivars which are the highest yielding under flood irrigation were also the highest yielding under sprinkler irrigation. The medium grains appear to be the most adaptive. However, some long grains did show potential. Adjuvants tested did increase the water infiltration into the Nada soil. Yield levels within 15 percent of those from flood irrigations were achieved. However, the high levels of adjuvants used were phytotoxic to the rice. Lower rates or other adjuvants might be better adapted to use on rice. Soil water infiltration as determined by rainfall simulator did reveal differences in infiltration rates of the soils tested. The clay soils had the highest infiltration rate at saturation. The fine sandy loam soils developed a crust after initial applications which reduced later infiltration rates significantly. All soils could be irrigated but some of the soils such as the Nada fine sandy loam had a saturated infiltration of less than 0. 65 cm per hour which could be prohibitive to a commercial rice production system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to estimate heritability values for some performance and egg quality traits of native <b>fowl</b> in Isfahan <b>breeding</b> center using REML and Bayesian approaches. The records were about 51521 and 975 for performance and egg quality traits, respectively. At the first step, variance components were estimated for body weight at hatch (BW 0), body weight at 8 weeks of age (BW 8), weight at sexual maturity (WSM), egg yolk weight (YW), egg Haugh unit and eggshell thickness, via REML approach using ASREML software. At the second step, the same traits were analyzed via Bayesian approach using Gibbs 3 f 90 software. In both approaches six different animal models were applied and the best model was determined using likelihood ratio test (LRT) and deviance information criterion (DIC) for REML and Bayesian approaches, respectively. Heritability estimates for BW 0, WSM and ST were the same in both approaches. For BW 0, LRT and DIC indexes confirmed that the model consisting maternal genetic, permanent environmental and direct genetic effects was significantly better than other models. For WSM, a model consisting of maternal permanent environmental effect in addition to direct genetic effect was the best. For shell thickness, the basic model consisting direct genetic effect was the best. The results for BW 8, YW and Haugh unit, were different between the two approaches. The reason behind this tiny differences was that the convergence could not be achieved for some models in REML approach and thus for these traits the Bayesian approach estimated the variance components more accurately. The results indicated that ignoring maternal effects, overestimates the direct genetic variance and heritability for most of the traits. Also, the Bayesian-based software could take more variance components into account...|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} domesticated animals, as their {{domestication}} mainly {{depends on the}} accident of their breeding freely under captivity, {{we ought not to}} expect that their reproductive system would be affected by any moderate degree of change. Those orders of quadrupeds and birds, of which the wild species breed most readily in our menageries, have afforded us the greatest number of domesticated productions. Savages {{in most parts of the}} world are fond of taming animals (18/68. Numerous instances could be given. Thus Livingstone ('Travels' page 217) states that the King of the Barotse, an inland tribe which never had any communication with white men, was extremely fond of taming animals, and every young antelope was brought to him. Mr. Galton informs me that the Damaras are likewise fond of keeping pets. The Indians of South America follow the same habit. Capt. Wilkes states that the Polynesians of the Samoan Islands tamed pigeons; and the New Zealanders, as Mr. Mantell informs me, kept various kinds of birds.); and if any of these regularly produced young, and were at the same time useful, they would be at once domesticated. If, when their masters migrated into other countries, they were in addition found capable of withstanding various climates, they would be still more valuable; and it appears that the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally withstand different climates. Some few domesticated animals, such as the reindeer and camel, offer an exception to this rule. Many of our domesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most unnatural conditions; for instance, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and ferrets breed in miserably confined hutches. Few European dogs of any kind withstand the climate of India without degenerating, but as long as they survive, they retain, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, their fertility; so it is, according to Dr. Daniell, with English dogs taken to Sierra Leone. The fowl, a native of the hot jungles of India, becomes more fertile than its parent-stock in every quarter of the world, until we advance as far north as Greenland and Northern Siberia, where this bird will not breed. Both fowls and pigeons, which I received during the autumn direct from Sierra Leone, were at once ready to couple. (18/69. For analogous cases with the fowl see Reaumur 'L'Art de faire Eclore' etc. 1749 page 243; and Col. Sykes in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1832 etc. With respect to the <b>fowl</b> not <b>breeding</b> in northern regions see Latham 'Hist. of Birds' volume 8 1823 page 169.)
