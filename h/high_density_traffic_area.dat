40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} interpretation of occupational and ambient particulate matter concentrations measured as PM 10 at a network of ten high density road traffic intersections in Kathmandu valley {{during the period of}} February 2008 to January 2009. The purpose was to understand the pollution trends associated with the high density road traffic intersections considering the levels of particulate matter concentrations (PM 10), representing the occupational and ambient air quality of the traffic police personnel of the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. The study indicates that the occupational PM 10 play a significant dominant role in controlling ambient PM 10 loads at the high density road traffic intersections. The occupational and ambient PM 10 concentrations in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>area</b> and road intersection of Kathmandu Valley showed a marked monthly and seasonal variation. High density traffic areas and road intersection of the Kathmandu valley were seriously polluted by PM 10.

A dedicated system called the Automatic Identification System (AIS) {{is used in the}} marine traffic to broadcast messages containing information about vessel: id, payload, size, speed, destination etc. used primary for ship collision avoidance. Due to geographical and physical reasons, AIS system is used regionally and it is not suited for <b>traffic</b> observation in <b>areas</b> far from coast. Vessel broadcast AIS messages with different frequency rate depending on the current speed of movement. In <b>areas</b> with increased <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> packet collisions would appear. Such collisions are avoided using the Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access technology implemented into the AIS. This principle ensures self-organization of broadcasted messages in a local area, but when observed from space, the collision of simultaneously transmitted messages in inevitable. Nano-satellites are small and cheap solutions for research needs with very limited payload intended for specific mission. Using a nano-satellite for AIS monitoring could provide data about vessel traffic in distant off-coast areas and give an insight into collision of IAS messages in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>areas.</b> One of the problems is to build the payload for the satellite – a flexible and efficient AIS receiver system that meets low energy, size and weight requirements. Embedded platforms like Rspberry Pi and PandaBoard are a cheap alternative to traditional computing solutions with enough computing power to be suitable for advanced signal processing also meeting the requirements for low power usage in satellite systems. Easy software development and adaption for the ARM architecture makes these boards an optimal platform for development. FUNcube Dongle, developed as part of AMSAT-UK’s FUNcube satellite project, is very small software defined embedded platform to make collecting of information form space available to anyone. In a combination with a small embedded platform like Raspbery Pi and software for AIS decoding it can be used as the AIS receiver on a nano-satellite.

40|$|The {{limitations}} of the current civil aviation surveillance systems include a lack of coverage in some areas and low performance in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability particularly in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>areas</b> including airports, with {{a negative impact on}} capacity and safety. Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) technology has been proposed to address these limitations by enabling improved situational awareness for all stakeholders and enhanced airborne and ground surveillance, resulting in increased safety and capacity. In particular, its scalability and adaptability should facilitate its use in general aviation and in ground vehicles. This should, in principle, provide affordable, effective surveillance of all air and ground traffic, even on airport taxiways and runways, and in airspace where radar is ineffective or unavailable. The success of the progressive implementation of ADS-B has led to numerous programmes for its introduction {{in other parts of the}} World where the operational environment is considerably different from that of Australia. However, a number of critical issues must be addressed in order to benefit from ADS-B, including the development and execution of a safety case that addresses both its introduction into legacy and new systems’ operational concepts, the latter including the Single European Sky (SES) / Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) and the US’ Next Generation Air Transportation System (NexGEN). This requires amongst others, a good understanding of the {{limitations of}} existing surveillance systems, ADS-B architecture and system failures and its interfaces to the existing and future ATM systems. Research on ADS-B to date has not addressed in detail the important questions of limitations of existing systems and ADS-B failure modes including their characterisation, modelling and assessment of impact. The latter is particularly important due to the sole dependency of ADS-B on GNSS for information on aircraft state and its reliance on communication technologies such as Mode-S Extended Squitter, VHF Data Link Mode- 4 (VDLM 4) or Universal Access Transceiver (UAT), to broadcast the surveillance information to ground-based air traffic control (ATC) and other ADS-B equipped aircraft within a specified range, all of which increase complexity and the potential for failures. This thesis proposes a novel framework for the assessment of the ADS-B system performance to meet the level of safety required for ground and airborne surveillance operations. The framework integrates various methods for ADS-B performance assessment in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity, availability and latency, and reliability assessment using probabilistic safety assessment methods; customized failure mode identification approach and fault tree analysis. Based on the framework, the thesis develops a failure mode register for ADS-B, identifies and quantifies the impact of a number of potential hazards for the ADS-B. Furthermore, this thesis identifies various anomalies in the onboard GNSS system that feeds aircraft navigation information into the ADS-B system. Finally, the thesis maps the ADS-B data availability and the quantified system performance to the envisioned airborne surveillance application’s requirements. The mapping exercise indicates that, the quantified ADS-B accuracy is sufficient for all applications while ADS-B integrity is insufficient to support the most stringent application: Airborne Separation (ASEP). In addition, some of the required performance parameters are unavailable from aircraft certified to DO- 260 standard. Therefore, all aircraft must be certified to DO- 260 B standard to support the applications and perform continuous monitoring, to ensure consistency in the system performance of each aircraft.

The contribution of leaded gasoline to total body lead content was estimated by measuring concentrations of Pb and its isotopes in blood. We also analyzed samples of ambient air particulate matter for PAH and heavy metal concentrations at the four different locations. Interregional differences in heavy metals in ambient air particulate matter were reflected relatively well by pigeon body loads. The higher lead and cadmium concentrations in blood, kidney, liver, and lung were found in the Amsterdam <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> <b>area,</b> followed by Amsterdam medium, Assen, and Maastricht. A high Pb concentration in blood coincided with relatively low 206 Pb/ 207 Pb values, indicating a high contribution of leaded gasoline to total blood Pb concentrations in pigeons from the Amsterdam <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> <b>area.</b> Significantly enhanced blood zinc values were found in pigeons from both locations in Amsterdam compared to pigeons from the other two areas. However, no differences in Zn tissue levels between the four different groups were found. Oxidative DNA damage, determined as the ratio of 7 -Hydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine/ deoxyguanosine, in pigeon liver was highest in Amsterdam-high, followed by Assen (low <b>traffic</b> <b>density).</b> Pb content, but not the Cd content, was positively associated with oxidative DNA damage in liver tissue.

25|$|A {{street network}} pattern {{can affect the}} {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> in <b>areas</b> with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants.

Therefore, energy synthesis combining energetics with systems ecology is applied to assess systematically the health status of urban ecosystems. Combining ecosystem health levels with spatial geographical information of different land use subsystems, the spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health is obtained, which is helpful for urban ecological regulation and spatial optimization. Taking the situation of Guangzhou, China in 2005 as a case study, the relative health states based on energy indicators and set pair analysis is evaluated. Results show that the health levels of the cultivated land, as well as areas with middle and low density buildings are relatively positive, while that of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> building and <b>traffic</b> <b>areas</b> are relatively weak.

The efficient CDA operation in such a busy traffic environment is promoted by the combined use of new and/or already available enabling airborne and ATM technology. This in-cludes airborne tools, such as FMS CDA functions, cockpit display cues, and im-proved ATC tools by means of accurate arrival management, air-ground data-link and controller sequencing aids.

First, the problem of collision avoidance among UAVs is considered and deconfliction algorithms are proposed. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is tested using simulations involving random flights in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic.</b> Further, the proposed collision avoidance algorithms are implemented using realistic six degree of freedom UAV models. The studies in this thesis show that implementation of the proposed collision avoidance algorithms leads to a safer and efficient operational airspace occupied by multiple UAVs. Next, coalition formation in a search and prosecute mission involving {{a large number of}} UAVs and targets is considered. This problem is shown to be NP-hard and a sub-optimal but polynomial time coalition formation strategy is proposed. Simulations are carried out to show that this coalition formation algorithm works well. The coalition formation algorithm is then extended to handle situations where the UAVs have limited communication ranges. Finally, this thesis considers some multiple UAV missions that require the application of collision avoidance and coalition formation techniques. The problem of multiple UAV rendezvous is tackled by using (i) a consensus among the UAVs to attain rendezvous and (ii) the collision avoidance algorithm previously developed for safety. The thesis also considers a search and prosecute mission where the UAVs also have to avoid collisions among one another. In summary, the main contributions of this thesis include (a) novel collision avoidance algorithms, which are conceptually simple and easy to implement, for resolving path conflicts – both planar and three dimensional – in a <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> airspace with UAVs in free flight and (b) efficient coalition formation algorithms for search and prosecute task with large number of UAVs and targets where UAVs have limited communication ranges and targets are maneuvering.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibilities of automating vehicular traffic and decrease traffic congestion by developing an intelligent driver agent model that autonomously navigates through a computer simulated traffic network. The aim was to examine various path nding algorithms and cost evaluation functions through di erent traffic conditions so that a basic intelligent driver agent model is designed using the best combination of algorithms and cost functions found. A computer simulation of vehicular traffic has been implemented to study different agent models. The intelligent driver agents developed act as independent entities with their own emergent properties and individual behaviours. Each simulated vehicle was navigated through the traffic network to its destination using a user defined algorithm and cost function. The case studies conducted focused on measuring the travel times of each driver agent from the starting to the destination point. The results indicated that the agents traveled at higher average speeds under low <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions, while lowering their average speed as the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> increased. It was also discovered that hybrid cost evaluation functions (designed by combining two or more basic cost functions) perform better in low and medium <b>density</b> <b>traffic,</b> while basic cost functions perform better under <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. Finally, the results revealed that Dijkstra pathfinding using a hybrid combination of time and length cost functions should be used under low and medium <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions and D* pathfinding using congestion cost evaluation function under <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. The conclusion was that the intelligent driver agent model implemented is suitable to be used as a navigation model for self-driving vehicles in traffic simulation software, but also given the right technology and social acceptance it is suitable to be implemented as a navigation model for robot vehicles and deployed in real world traffic situations...|$|R

On-road vehicle detection has been achieved using an active learning approach, and vehicles are tracked using a Condensation particle filter. While most state-of-the art lane tracking systems are not capable of performing in high-density traffic scenes, the proposed framework exploits robust vehicle tracking to allow for improved lane tracking in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that lane tracking performance, robustness, and temporal response are significantly improved in the proposed framework, while also tracking vehicles, with minimal additional hardware requirements...|$|R
40|$|While {{performing}} a mission, multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{need to avoid}} each other to prevent collisions among them. In this paper, we design a collision avoidance algorithm to resolve the conflict among UAVs that are {{on a collision course}} while flying to heir respective destinations. The collision avoidance algorithm consist of each UAV that is on a collision course reactively executing a maneuver that will, as in `inverse' Proportional Navigation (PN), increase Line of Sight (LOS) rate between them, resulting in a `pulling out' of collision course. The algorithm is tested for <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> scenarios as well as for robustness in the presence of noise...|$|R
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of traffic-originated pollutants input into the environmentand their impact on biocenosis, the passive bioindication was used at eight selected road sections, where mapping of epiphytic lichen flora was implemented according to a German (VDI) method. The mapping of epiphytic lichens implies that lichens {{can be used in}} bioindication studies along roads; indeed, at locations with <b>higher</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> (average daily <b>traffic</b> > 20, 000) fewer lichen species were identified in comparison with locations with lower <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> At road sections with very <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> only epiphytic lichen species most resistant to pollution were recorded, while less resistant but still highly tolerant to nitrogen pollution lichen species were recorded at road sections with moderate <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> (average daily <b>traffic</b> around 10, 000). At those road sections, the lichen species more sensitive to air pollution also begin to occur, which were not recorded at road sections with very <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density,</b> not even 100 m away from the roadside...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{automated}} driving constitutes a temporary {{transfer of the}} primary driving task from the driver to the automated vehicle. In case of system limits, drivers take back control of the vehicle. This study investigates the effect of varying traffic situations and non-driving related tasks on the take-over process and quality. The experiment is conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. The standardized visual Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT) and the cognitive n-back Task are used to simulate the non-driving related tasks. Participants experience four different traffic situations. Results of this experiment show a strong influence of the traffic situations on the take-over quality in a highway setting, if the <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> is <b>high.</b> The non-driving related tasks SuRT and the n-back Task show similar effects on the take-over process with a higher total number of collisions by the SuRT in the <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> situation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1946 the USSR ordered 20 {{electric}} locomotives from General Electric, the same US corporation that supplied locomotives {{for the first}} Soviet electrification. Due to the cold war, {{they could not be}} delivered to the USSR so they were sold elsewhere. The Milwaukee Road in the US obtained 12, nicknamed [...] "Little Joes", [...] "Joe" [...] referring to Joseph Stalin, the Soviet premier. In the mid-1950s, the USSR launched a two-pronged approach to replace steam locomotives. They would electrify the lines with <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> and slowly convert the others to diesel. The result was a slow but steady introduction of both electric and diesel traction which lasted until about 1975 when their last steam locomotives were retired. In the US, steam went out about 1960, 15 years earlier than for the USSR.|$|R
40|$|Moss samples Barbula lambarenensis (P. Vard) {{were taken}} along {{major and minor}} roads of Ile-Ife, in the South Western part of Nigeria and were {{analysed}} after triple acid digestion for the trace metals: Lead, Zinc and Copper by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption spectrophotometry. The triplicate field data were averaged to yield mean concentrations at each sample location. The lead and zinc levels ranged from 196. 8 (0. 04) - 108. 5 (0. 03) μg g - 1 and from 593. 1 (0. 02) - 35. 0 (0. 10) μg g - 1 dry weight, respectively in the moss samples. These results from {{the analysis of the}} moss samples show that Pb and Zn levels were generally higher in <b>areas</b> with relatively <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> than low <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> <b>areas.</b> Similar studies on Copper gave lower values (47. 0 (0. 01) - 10. 1 (0. 01) μg Cu g - 1) dry weight in the samples which did not show any correlation with <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> Analysis of standard plant reference materials (BCR:CRM 062) gave results Pb 26. 7 (0. 10); Zn 17. 4 (0. 46) and Cu 45. 8 (0. 40) which are found to be in good agreement with the certified values for Pb 25. 0 (1. 5); Zn 16. 0 (0. 7) and Cu 46. 6 (1. 8). The average traffic volumes of the study area are 990 vehicles per hour and 520 vehicles per hour for <b>high</b> and low <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> <b>areas,</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|Real-time, {{in-vehicle}} {{guidance on}} eco-driving {{is likely to}} produce substantial improvements in vehicle fuel economy. However, the benefits of such in-vehicle systems should be achieved without impairing driver safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems, which provided advice on gas pedal usage. Hill driving scenarios with variable <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> were used to test drivers’ prioritization of safe and fuel-efficient driving. A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback gas pedal created the smallest errors in gas pedal usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at eco-driving in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over eco-driving, however safety margins were shorter in the <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>traffic</b> condition, despite the degradation in eco-driving performance. The findings suggest which modality could be most appropriate for presenting in-vehicle eco-driving guidance, and hint that these systems should advise drivers based on the prevailing traffic conditions...|$|R
