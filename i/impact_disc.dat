Effects of climate change on oilseed crops based on climate projections of the next 30 years was have been analyzed. Changes in surface temperature values and precipitation amounts for the period of 2011 - 2041 have been evaluated seasonally and annually with the corresponding values of 1961 - 1990 (RF). Based on the RegCM 3 -ECHAM 5 -A 2 scenario, the average temperature is expected to increase 0. 2 - 0. 6 Co until 2041. The smallest temperature change is predicted to occur in spring season where the greatest temperature change (0, 6 - 0, 8 C°) is expected to occur in summerand autumn season. The changes in total annual precipitation amounts had generally increase tendency (5 - 25 %) over the region especially in winter season 30 % increase rate was expected over Kırşehir, Aksaray and South part of Kırıkkale province. The changes in total autumn season precipitation amount is predicted to increase (20 %) over Niğde but decrease (5 %) over the south part of Kırıkkale and southwest part of Kırşehir and Aksaray province in autumn season. Considering the effects of the climate change in the next 30 years, agricultural production in TR 71 region is in quite a good place compared to other part of Turkey but this change will indeed affect the agricultural potential of the region substantially. Annual temperature elevation will aggravate the plant temperature stress where increased evaporation will negatively impact the yield, increasing the pressure on the limited irrigation potential.

Our boundary-integral simulations suggest that all systems eventually follow the universal behavior characterized by slowly varying exponents predicted in [Eggers et al., PRL 98, 094502 (2007) ]. However, the time scale for the onset of this final regime is found to vary by orders of magnitude depending on the system in question: while for the <b>impacting</b> <b>disc</b> it is well in the millisecond range, for the gas injection needle universal behavior sets in only a few microseconds before pinch-off.

40|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} free surface flow {{is the impact}} of a solid object on a liquid: At impact a “crown” splash is created and a surface cavity (void) emerges which immediately starts to collapse due to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding liquid. Eventually the cavity closes in a single point about halfway down its length and shoots out a fast and extremely slender water jet. Here we <b>impact</b> thin circular <b>discs</b> a few centimeters in radius with velocities of a few meters per second. Combining high-speed imaging with sophisticated boundary-integral simulations we elucidate various aspects of this fascinating process. First we show that the mechanism behind the formation of the fast, almost needle-like liquid jet is reminiscent of the violent jets of fluidized metal created during the explosion “of lined cavities” in military and mining operations. We obtain quantitative agreement between our simulations, experiments, and analytical model. Next we use visualization experiments to measure the air flow as it is squeezed out of the shrinking impact cavity. Together with numerical simulations we show that even in our simple system of a 2 cm <b>disc</b> <b>impacting</b> at merely 1 m/s the air flow easily attains supersonic velocities. A long-standing controversy in the fluid dynamics community has been until recently the pinch-off behavior of a bubble inside a liquid. Our observation of different time scales for the onset of the predicted final regime reconciles the different views expressed in recent literature about bubble pinch-off. Next we replace the <b>impacting</b> <b>disc</b> by a long, smooth cylinder and find that the closure position of the cavity displays distinct regimes separated by discrete jumps which are consistently observed in experiment and numerical simulations. Finally, we simulate the collapse of nanobubbles nucleating from small (50 nm) pits drilled into a silicon wafer.

In this study, we first determined whether oxidative stress negatively <b>impacts</b> <b>disc</b> matrix metabolism using disc organotypic and cell cultures. Mouse disc organotypic culture grown at atmospheric oxygen (20 % O(2)) exhibited perturbed disc matrix homeostasis, including reduced proteoglycan synthesis and enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinases, compared to discs grown at low oxygen levels (5 % O(2)). Human disc cells grown at 20 % O(2) showed increased levels of mitochondrial-derived superoxide anions and perturbed matrix homeostasis. Treatment of disc cells with the mitochondria-targeted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger XJB- 5 - 131 blunted the adverse effects caused by 20 % O(2). Importantly, we demonstrated that treatment of accelerated aging Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice, previously established to be a useful in vivo model to study age-related intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), also resulted in improved disc total glycosaminoglycan content and proteoglycan synthesis. This demonstrates that mitochondrial-derived ROS contributes to age-associated IDD in Ercc 1 (-/Δ) mice. Collectively, these data provide strong experimental evidence that mitochondrial-derived ROS play a causal role in driving changes linked to aging-related IDD and a potentially important role for radical scavengers in preventing IDD...|$|R

40|$|Fragments of {{optically}} flat silica discs {{embedded in}} synthetic gouge were deformed {{to examine the}} relationship between the development of striations and slickenlines, and deformation mechanisms, conditions, and fault rheology. Experiments were performed under hydrothermal conditions in a rotary shear apparatus at 100 °C or 450 °C, to shear strains of 2. 02  < γ <  8. 25. Slip hardening and softening prevail at low and high temperatures, respectively. In recovered samples, disc fragment surfaces are decorated by fine gouge, sometimes arranged in trails, pits, and scratch marks. Prominent grooves—inferred slickenlines—with constant orientation, wavelength < 10  μm, and amplitude < 0. 7  μm are only observed on disc fragments deformed at 450 °C. Some parts of the grooves below the original disc fragment surface contain scattered rounded beads of silica ~ 200  nm diameter. Conversely, close examination of pits in 100 °C experiments reveals they contain angular particles < 2  μm diameter. The 200  nm diameter crystalline quartz can precipitate at 450 °C in only 250  s, well within the time frame of the experiments but precipitation at 100 °C would take at least 8  years. No systematic dislocation arrays were observed in the quartz disc fragments, but microfractures are sporadically present. This indicates that at both temperatures brittle failure generated microfractures and microcomminution occurred where gouge particles <b>impacted</b> <b>disc</b> fragment surfaces.

40|$|Reducing {{the area}} through which a fluid {{is allowed to}} flow often leads to an {{increase}} of flow velocity. A familiar {{example of this is}} a garden hose, where one can change the rather weak stream that usually flows out into a strong jet by narrowing the orifice {{at the end of the}} hose. In this example, the walls of the garden hose orifice are forcing the water to flow through a smaller area, and hence increase the velocity. A similar phenomenon happens naturally after an axisymmetric object (like a circular disc or a sphere) impacts on a water surface. A surface cavity is formed, which collapses and after pinch-off two jets are formed: one shooting upwards and one downwards. The velocities of the jets and also of the water surface just before the pinch-off are usually much higher than the velocity of the impacting object. This is because the free surface evolves in such a way that it focuses the liquid towards the axis of symmetry of the system. We show that not only the liquid phase, but also the entrained air attains high velocities. A subtle interplay between the air flowing out and the water rushing in, eventually leads to an air flow that attains supersonic speeds. By <b>impacting</b> <b>discs</b> with a non-axisymmetric disturbance, we experimentally show that asymmetries have a dramatic effect on the evolution of the collapsing cavity. Perturbations that initially exist - no matter how small – persist throughout the collapse in an oscillating manner, with growing relative amplitude. As a consequence, non-linear effects start to influence the shape of the cavity. These findings, and others that are presented in the thesis, can be used in, for example, research into inertial fusion energy and the formation of stellar jets...|$|R

Instantaneous Doppler maps show how the stream impact moves in velocity space during an orbit. In our maximum entropy Doppler tomogram, the stream impact region emission is distorted, and the spiral density wave emission is suppressed.

DISC 1 loss-of-function resulted in a marked decrease in SV exocytic rates during neuronal stimulation and was associated with reduced Ca(2 +) transients at nerve terminals. Impaired SV release was efficiently rescued by elevation of extracellular Ca(2 +), hinting at a link between DISC 1 and voltage-gated Ca(2 +) channels. Accordingly, blockade of N-type Cav 2. 2 channels mimics and occludes the effect of DISC 1 inactivation on SV exocytosis, and overexpression of DISC 1 in a heterologous system increases Cav 2. 2 currents.

Degeneration of the IVD {{is thought to be}} a contributor to low back pain (LBP), which affects up to 80 % of the population at enormous economic cost. The role of the {{intervertebral disc}} in supporting and resisting applied loading to the spine, along with the observation of disorders associated with abnormal spinal loading, provide support to the theory that applied mechanical loading is crucial in maintaining the health of the intervertebral disc. The encompassing goal of this work was to examine the biological response of the intervertebral disc to changes in the surrounding mechanical environment in a large animal model. Aim 1 utilized an organ culture model to explore the relationship between disc mechanics and biology in needle puncture injury, a commonly used model of experimentally induced disc degeneration, thus providing a possible mechanism for in vivo injury induced disc degeneration models. Aim 2 was to explore the interaction between the amplitude of applied mechanical loading and intervertebral disc cell signaling, also performed in an organ culture model to include cell-matrix signal transduction. Aim 3 addressed frequency and age effects on the IVD response to mechanical stimulation, performed in vitro to control for the effects of varying matrix compositions between old and young animals. Finally, Aim 4 utilized kmeans and fuzzy c-means clustering techniques to reveal patterns in experimental phenotype (determined by gene expression data) and gene response to experimental conditions. The application of biclustering, where the gene responses within experimental phenotypes are clustered to elucidate possible mechanisms for different gene level-responses to experimental conditions, was also accomplished. Finally, the ability for the model to predict the behavior of other genes critical to IVD mechanobiology, or in determining the membership of an unexamined experimental phenotype was explored.

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc {{is a critical}} part of the intersegmental soft tissue of the spinal column, providing flexibility and mobility, while absorbing large complex loads. Spinal disease, including disc herniation and degeneration, may be a significant contributor to low back pain. Clinically, disc herniations are treated with both nonoperative and operative methods. Operative treatment for disc herniation includes removal of the herniated material when neural compression occurs. While this strategy may have short-term advantages over nonoperative methods, the remaining disc material is not addressed and surgery for mild degeneration may have limited long-term advan-tage over nonoperative methods.

We show that energy is dissipated {{at the edge of a}} circumbinary disc and this is associated with the tidal torque that maintains the cavity: angular momentum is transferred from the binary to the disc through the action of compressional shocks and viscous friction. These shocks can be viewed as being produced by fluid elements which drift into the cavity and, before being accreted, are accelerated onto trajectories that send them back to <b>impact</b> the <b>disc.</b> The rate of energy dissipation is approximately equal to the product of potential energy per unit mass at the disc’s inner edge and the accretion rate, estimated from the disc parameters just beyond the cavity edge, that would occur without the binary. For very thin discs, the actual accretion rate onto the binary may be significantly less. We calculate the energy emitted by a circumbinary disc taking into account energy dissipation at the inner edge and also irradiation arising there from reprocessing of light from the stars. We find that, for tight PMS binaries, the SED is dominated by emission from the inner edge at wavelengths between 1 – 4 and 10 µm. This may apply to systems like CoRoT 223992193 and V 1481 Ori...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the biomechanical effects of injections of a protease {{on the characteristics}} of bovine coccygeal and human lumbar disc motion segments. Methods: Mechanics of treated tissues were measured immediately after injection and 3  h after injection. Motion segments underwent axial rotation and flexion-extension loading. Results: Stiffness and neutral zone parameters experienced significant changes over time, with bovine tissues more strongly affected than human cadaver tissues. This was true in both axial rotation and flexion-extension. The treatment type significantly affected the neutral zone measurements in axial rotation. Hysteresis parameters were impacted by control injections. Conclusion: The extrapolation of bovine coccygeal motion testing results to human lumbar disc mechanics is not yet practical. The injected treatment may have a smaller <b>impact</b> on <b>disc</b> mechanics than time in testing. Viscoelasticity of human lumbar <b>discs</b> may be <b>impacted</b> by any damage to the annulus fibrosis induced by needlestick. The Translational Potential of this Article: Preclinical testing of novel spinal devices is essential to the design validation and regulatory processes, but current testing techniques rely on cadaveric testing of primarily older spines with essentially random amounts of disc degeneration. The present work investigates the viability of using trypsin injections to create a more uniform preclinical model of disc degeneration from a mechanics perspective, for the purpose of testing spinal devices. Such a model would facilitate translation of new spinal technologies to clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Impaction bone {{grafting}} (IBG) with human allograft remains the preferred approach for replacement of lost bone stock during revision hip surgery. Associated problems include cost, disease transmission, and stem subsidence. Synthetic grafts are therefore appealing, and ideally display similar mechanical characteristics as allograft, but with enhanced ability to form de novo bone. High and {{low molecular weight}} forms of three different polymers [poly(DL-lactide) (P(DL) LA), poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (P(DL) LGA), and poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) ] were milled, <b>impacted</b> into <b>discs,</b> and then examined in a shear testing rig, in comparison to allograft. In addition, skeletal stem cells (SSCs) were combined {{with each of the}} milled polymers, followed by impaction and examination for cell viability and number, via fluorostaining and biochemical assays. The shear strengths of high/low mwt P(DL) LA, and high/low mwt P(DL) LGA were significantly higher than allograft (p < 0. 01). High/low mwt PCL had significantly lower shear strengths (p < 0. 01). WST- 1 assay and fluorstaining indicated significantly increased cell viability on high mwt P(DL) LA and high mwt P(DL) LGA over allograft (p < 0. 05). Mechanical and biochemical analysis indicated improved properties of high mwt P(DL) LA and high mwt P(DL) LGA over allograft. This study indicates the potential of these polymers for use as substitute human allograft, creating a living composition with SSC for application in IBG...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of warm dark matter (WDM) on {{hydrodynamic}} simulations of galaxy formation {{as part of the}} Making Galaxies in a Cosmological Context (MaGICC) project. We simulate three different galaxies using three WDM candidates of 1, 2 and 5 keV and compare results with pure cold dark matter simulations. WDM slightly reduces star formation and produces less centrally concentrated stellar profiles. These effects are most evident for the 1 keV candidate but almost disappear for m_WDM> 2 keV. All simulations form similar stellar discs independent of WDM particle mass. In particular, the disc scale length does not change when WDM is considered. The reduced amount of star formation in the case of 1 keV particles is due to the effects of WDM on merging satellites which are on average less concentrated and less gas rich. The altered satellites cause a reduced starburst during mergers because they trigger weaker disc instabilities in the main galaxy. Nevertheless we show that disc galaxy evolution is much more sensitive to stellar feedback than it is to WDM candidate mass. Overall we find that WDM, especially when restricted to current observational constraints (m_WDM> 2 keV), has a minor <b>impact</b> on <b>disc</b> galaxy formation.
