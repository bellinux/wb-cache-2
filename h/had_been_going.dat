5|$|In the meantime, the Gothic War in Italy {{against the}} Ostrogoths <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> badly for the Byzantine Empire, with the Gothic king Totila having wrested {{most of the}} {{peninsula}} back from the Byzantine troops. In 549, Emperor Justinian decided to send a major expeditionary force to Italy with Germanus as its head. Soon, however, {{he changed his mind}} and appointed the patricius Liberius instead, before cancelling the expedition altogether.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The idea <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E

David Wallace's meeting with Michael marked the show's first acknowledgment of the economic crisis facing much of the globalized nation at the time of the episode due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested {{and a lot of}} money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending.

5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability. But by then the Sasanid Empire was severely disorganised and had been severely weakened by years of war and civil strife over the succession to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, China {{became the}} first export {{customer}} for the Su-35 when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a contract worth $2billion {{for the purchase of}} 24aircraft for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Although Chinese officials had first shown interest in the modernized Su-35 design in 2006, it was not until 2010 when Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products, was ready to start talks with the Chinese government on the sale of the Su-35. Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on in 2012, when a protocol agreement on the purchase of the aircraft was signed. There were subsequent media reports and official remarks that the two countries had signed a contract and deliveries of the aircraft were imminent, but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015.|$|E
5|$|At Lampsacus, John {{met with}} his brother, who rewarded his {{victories}} with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half-brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. Then, or sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and Lesbos as personal domains (pronoiai). In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in Macedonia. In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes. After long and hard fighting, {{in the summer of}} 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married to Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.|$|E

5|$|Sweeping through Libreville unopposed, {{the troops}} easily {{captured}} the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka {{military base in}} Lambaréné when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning of the impending attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on. Cousseran dodged answering the question and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{campaign}} {{of the new}} reign was directed against the Khurramites in Adharbayjan and Arran. The Khurramite revolt <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on since 816/7, aided by the inaccessible mountains of the province {{and the absence of}} large Arab Muslim population centres, except for a few cities in the lowlands. Al-Ma'mun had left the local Muslims largely to their own devices, although a succession of military commanders tried to subdue the rebellion on their own initiative, and thus gain control of the country's newly discovered mineral resources, only to be defeated by the Khurramites under the capable leadership of Babak. Immediately after his accession, al-Mu'tasim sent the Tahirid ṣāḥib al-shurṭa of Baghdad and Samarra, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, to deal with an expansion of the Khurramite rebellion from Jibal into Hamadan. Ishaq achieved success swiftly, and by December 833 had suppressed the rebellion, forcing many Khurramites to seek refuge in the Byzantine Empire. It was only in 835 that al-Mu'tasim took action against Babak himself, when he assigned his trusted and capable lieutenant, al-Afshin, to command the campaign against him. After three years of cautious and methodical campaigning, al-Afshin was able to capture Babak at his capital of Budhdh on 26 August 837, extinguishing the rebellion. Babak was brought captive to Samarra, where, on 3 January 838, he was paraded before the people seated on an elephant, and then publicly executed.|$|E
