5|$|<b>Kettle</b> Creek {{flows through}} Elk Township in Tioga County, then Abbott Township and Stewardson Township in Potter County, then Leidy Township and Noyes Township in Clinton County. Its mouth {{is at the}} {{community}} of Westport. Major tributaries include Cross Fork, Hammersley Fork, Little <b>Kettle</b> Creek, and others. The <b>Kettle</b> Creek Lake is located on <b>Kettle</b> Creek. Numerous metals and other substances contaminate the creek. These include iron, aluminum, manganese, and sulfates. The creek's discharge at Westport ranges from 4 to 6280 cubic feet per second and the pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.6. It also experiences abnormally high water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Hard {{surfacing}} {{of roads}} {{in part of}} the <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed began in 1930 to 1938. The Alvin R. Bush Dam {{was built on the}} creek in the late 1950s to protect against flooding. The creek was the subject of an Operation Scarlift study from 1970 to 1972. A USGS gauge was installed on the stream in 1972. The <b>Kettle</b> Creek Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s. The creek became the third Home Rivers initiative of Trout Unlimited in 1998. The main industries in the <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed in the 21st century are tourism, agriculture, and lumbering.|$|E

Above Twomile Run on <b>Kettle</b> Creek, the sulfate concentration was 16 milligrams per liter and at the mouth it was 11 milligrams per liter. Upstream of the acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from under 10 to 17 parts per million. In areas affected by acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from 37 to 1375 parts per million.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Kettle</b> Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via <b>Kettle</b> Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and fishing in the area. An Indian village existed {{at the mouth of}} the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763. In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting rights in the area until 1804.|$|E
5|$|The {{confluence}} of Twomile Run with <b>Kettle</b> Creek was completely devoid {{of fish in}} 1967, but by 1997, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed two species of fish, white sucker and smallmouth bass in this location.

A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in the <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed. Rock formations in the <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E

50|$|Electric <b>kettles</b> were {{introduced}} {{as a means}} to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. They are normally constructed of durable plastic or steel (with a plastic handle) and powered by mains electricity. In modern <b>kettles,</b> the heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2-3 kW at 220V. In countries with 110V mains electricity, <b>kettles</b> may be less powerful (1-1.5 kW) to avoid drawing too much current and requiring a very thick supply wire.|$|R

5|$|The {{watershed}} of <b>Kettle</b> Creek has {{an area of}} 244 square miles. It {{is located}} in Clinton, Potter, Cameron, and Tioga Counties. Forested land makes up 93.5 percent of the lower <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed, 2.7 percent is abandoned coal mines and quarries, 2.4 percent is grassland, and 1.4 percent is developed land. This part of the watershed is not densely populated. The {{upper reaches of the}} watershed are also mostly forested, with some riparian meadows and camps. Public lands such as state forest or state park lands occupy 92 percent of the watershed. Most of the private land is located near floodplains. A total of 0.3 percent of the watershed, or 456 acres, (including 15 percent of the private land) is agricultural land. Much of the private and agricultural land is either in the northern reaches of the watershed, near Germania, or in or near the lower <b>Kettle</b> Creek valley. Wetlands make up under 1 percent of the watershed's area; 37 percent of them are on private lands. A total of 47 percent, or 382 acres, of the watershed's wetlands are riverine wetlands. palustrine wetlands cover 299 acres, or 37 percent of the total wetlands, and 133 acres (16 percent) are lacustrine wetlands. Most of the watershed's lacustrine wetlands are located in <b>Kettle</b> Creek's floodplain. Palustrine wetlands are found on the <b>Kettle</b> Creek Lake.|$|E
