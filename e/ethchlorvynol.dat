5000|$|Glutethimide is a CYP2D6 enzyme inducer.

The general {{sedative}} effect also adds {{to the effect of}} the combination. It produces an intense euphoria similar to IV heroin use. The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a Substitutionmittel that may be a useful alternative to methadone. The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of glutethimide since 1984, a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when less-than-gifted chemists are doing the deed with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control. The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like <b>ethchlorvynol,</b> methyprylon, or the oldest barbiturates is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like methaqualone. Doriden was discontinued in the US by manufacturers in 1993.

40|$|The term {{addictive}} as used by {{the popular}} press frequently confuses the more precise concepts of acute and chronic tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal, and psychologic dependence. Serious physical dependence on psychoactive drugs is rare and is easily managed.

Some tactics are available — for example, confrontation and discussion with the patient about how a drug {{is not going to be}} effective over long periods.

40|$|Studies of <b>ethchlorvynol</b> (ECV) -induced {{pulmonary}} edema were undertaken for {{determination of the}} structural basis of increased microvascular permeability. Rats were administered an intravenous bolus dose of 15 mg/kg ECV and killed at time intervals between 5 minutes and 72 hours. Oyster glycogen and ferritin were used as permeability probes for identification of the sites of altered microvascular permeability. Edema fluid containing ferritin begins to accumulate in the alveolar interstitium 10 minutes after EVC. Thirty minutes after ECV, marked intersitial edema fluid is present containing both permeability probes. The absence of any appreciable transendothelial movement of either probe via vesicles {{and the presence of}} open endothelial junctions led the authors to propose the latter as the principal determinant of the increase in permeability. In addition to open endothelial junctions, prominent subendothelial blebs occur. These blebs develop in an otherwise intact endothelium and increase in frequency and size with time following their appearance at 10 minutes. Ferritin and glycogen progressively accumulate within the blebs. At 15 minutes the concentration of ferritin in blebs appears to equal that in plasma, whereas glycogen is absent or sparsely present in a few blebs. At 60 minutes both permeability probes have become concentrated in the blebs. The mechanism of formation of the blebs and concentration in them of the permeability probes cannot yet be specified. The lesion caused by ECV is completely reversible, so that by 72 hours after ECV there is complete resolution of interstitial edema, disappearance of the subendothelial blebs, and closure of endothelial junctions.

40|$|<b>Ethchlorvynol</b> (ECV), {{an agent}} which {{produces}} reversible pulmonary edema, was studied for {{its effects on}} cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell (BPAE) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVE) monolayers. Endothelial cell monolayers 6 days post-confluent were treated with 1 mg/ml ECV for time intervals of from 5 minutes to 15 hours. ECV treatment caused a mild endothelial cell retraction evident at 10 minutes which increased in severity with increasing duration of exposure to ECV. Retraction of endothelial cells resulted {{in the formation of}} irregularly delineated gaps between cells, which remained attached to one another by slender filamentous processes. Despite the severity of the endothelial cell lesion, no cell lysis or cell detachment from the substratum occurred. Furthermore, removal of ECV from cell cultures resulted in the reversal of the endothelial cell lesion. Cytochemical distribution of actin microfilaments in control monolayers localized to a dense peripheral band of actin filaments and to a set of interconnected central microfilaments oriented in general parallel to the long axis of the cell. Endothelial cells treated with ECV for as little as 10 minutes showed a loss of F-actin from the dense peripheral band of microfilaments progressing until the dense peripheral band was entirely lost after 4 hours' exposure to ECV. By 4 hours central microfilaments had reorganized into a prominent series of microfilament bundles aligned parallel {{to each other and to}} the long axis of the cell. For investigation of a possible loss of attachment sites of actin filaments as the basis for the lesion, the localization of vinculin was examined in control and ECV-treated BPAE monolayers. After 2 hours' exposure to ECV, vinculin localization within monolayers was affected little, if at all. No effects of ECV on intermediate filaments were observed either. It is proposed that the dense peripheral band of actin bundles is important in maintaining well-spread endothelial cells in monolayers and that ECV acts to destroy the integrity of this structure. It is further proposed that a reaction of endothelial cells to ECV in vivo analogous to that seen in tissue culture accounts for the production of pulmonary edema by creating gaps between cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relationship among}} endothelial cell (EC) retraction, cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP), {{and the status of}} cellular actin, ATP levels, F-actin content, and cytochemical redistribution in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were assessed. EC monolayers 7 days after confluence were exposed to <b>ethchlorvynol</b> (ECV), histamine, or cytochalasin B (cyto B) for time intervals from 5 - 90 minutes. All 3 agents resulted in endothelial cell retraction without significant effect on cellular ATP content. Sixty-minute incubation of monolayers in glucose-free media containing antimycin A and 2 -deoxyglucose depleted cellular ATP to less than 10 % of control levels. ATP depleted monolayers failed to retract when incubated with ECV, histamine, or cyto B. ATP depletion resulted in loss of the prominent EC margins but only a rare gap between adjacent cells. When ATP levels were allowed to recover, the ability of EC monolayers to retract was restored. Actin filaments in control monolayers localized to a dense peripheral band of actin, a paranuclear complex, and bundles of microfilaments orientated parallel to the long axis of the cell. ECV induced complete loss of the dense peripheral band and other changes in the actin disposition. Monolayers exposed to histamine showed a retraction of the dense peripheral band of actin to a subcortical position. Cyto B caused loss of the dense peripheral band and the longitudinal microfilament bundles. Monolayers depleted of ATP lost their dense peripheral band and exhibited a disorganized, tangled web of microfilaments. Neither histamine nor ECV modified the actin distribution in ATP-depleted monolayers, whereas exposure to cyto B resulted in substantial change in actin with formation of a rim inside the cell membrane and considerable loss of actin filaments. ECV or histamine induced a small reduction in F-actin content while cyto B resulted in a 50 % decline in 15 minutes. ATP depletion resulted in a 19 % decrease in F-actin, with no further reduction on subsequent exposure to histamine or ECV. Cyto B treatment of ATP-depleted monolayers caused a drop in F-actin content equivalent to that observed in cells with normal ATP levels. These studies indicate that ATP is essential for changes in actin filament distribution and endothelial cell retraction produced by ECV, histamine or cyto B, and make it unlikely that any of these agents acts simply by depolymerization of actin filaments or modification of the dense peripheral band, although disruption of the dense peripheral band may facilitate retraction in the presence of adequate levels of cell ATP...|$|E
