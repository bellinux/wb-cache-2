25|$|Before Hipparchus, astronomers {{knew that}} the lengths of the seasons are not equal. Hipparchus made {{observations}} of equinox and solstice, and according to Ptolemy (Almagest III.4) determined that spring (from spring equinox to summer solstice) lasted 94½ days, and summer (from summer solstice to autumn equinox) 92½ days. This is inconsistent with a premise of the Sun moving around the Earth in a circle at uniform speed. Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not {{at the center of}} the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center. This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well. It is known today that the planets, including the Earth, move in approximate ellipses around the Sun, but this was not discovered until Johannes Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. The value for the eccentricity attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is 1/24 of the radius of the orbit (which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> large), and the direction of the apogee would be at longitude 65.5° from the vernal equinox. Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values. One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of 95¾ and 91¼ days. His other triplet of solar positions is consistent with 94¼ and 92½ days, an improvement on the results (94½ and 92½ days) attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy, which a few scholars still question the authorship of. Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. Aaboe).|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's (ANN) {{review of}} the first volume states that [...] "Hibiki's Magic...focus on the ways that magic effects the {{everyday}} lives of its users. The personal focus is welcome, but the book <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> compressed and rushed to evoke exactly the emotional response that it desires." [...] While {{at the same time}} describing the first volume as having an [...] "inspirational tone", the review ends by saying, [...] "Don't come to Hibiki's Magic expecting a life-changing re-examination of magic. It's a heavy dose of pure cuteness for those who like their sweet-and-sour drama with lots of cheese." [...] The first volume of Hibiki's Magic was featured in ANN's Right Turn Only column in January 2007, where Carlo Santos compares the series to [...] "Someday's Dreamers with more guts and heart," [...] which portrays magicians as similar to normal people with [...] "weaknesses and all" [...] as opposed to [...] "other tales of magic [...] focus on how cool and different magicians are [...]" [...] Visually, the series is described as being too similar to [...] "every other fantasy series" [...] and even cites similarities with [...] "Hogwarts' magic robes and school logo." [...] IGN Comics' review said, [...] "This book ought to be fairly popular for its intended age group....Make no mistake, this book is cute {{in every sense of the}} word...but at the same time it's a solid story that breaks out of that cuteness mold." ...|$|E
500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And just when you think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} about the gay storyline fans and critics alike {{pushed for a}} romantic pairing between Chad and Will due to the chemistry between the actors. Errol Lewis of Soap Opera Network explained that the two would have great potential as a romantic pairing, due to their heritage alone; with Chad being a DiMera, and Will being a Brady, would solidify the pairing as [...] "star-crossed lovers" [...] because of the long-standing feud between their families being staple within the series for so long. Despite both characters being involved in romantic pairings with females at the time, the pairing had already established a large fan base. The two, however, remain friends even when Will does {{turn out to be}} gay. The pairing is referred to by fans by their portmanteau [...] "Chill." [...] Despite the joke between costars, fans immediately began pushing for the pairing. Deidrick said he would be open to the potential pairing if the writers were to go in that direction. In June 2011, the duo ranked at #2 in the [...] "Top Dream Couples" [...] category on TV Guide Canadas [...] "Soapgeist". Critics praised the writers for maintaining Chad and Will's friendship, and developing his friendship with Sonny despite both characters being gay. However, fans also pushed for a Sonny/Chad pairing after Chad defends him to a gay bully in September 2011. In response Smith jokingly shot down the idea and said that Chad <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> tall for Sonny. Greg Hernandez said it was Chad's friendship with Will and Sonny that endeared him to the character. Fans also spoke out when Chad's friendship with Will and Sonny started taking a back seat to other storylines.|$|E
