5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, {{the murder of a}} U.S. Army Lieutenant General has Mulder and Scully {{struggling}} to stop a seemingly invisible assassin. The two agents soon learn that they are <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> from the start, as the U.S. government is attempting to cover up the existence of American POWs still being kept in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's arch-rival Roman Dmowski, {{traveled}} to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring {{to discourage the}} Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy {{to the end of}} Piłsudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered in the mud and as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
50|$|The Anna Karenina {{principle}} {{describes an}} endeavor {{in which a}} deficiency {{in any one of}} a number of factors <b>dooms</b> it <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.|$|R

2500|$|The pseudo-metaphysical method puts {{forward the}} method of science as {{the method of}} philosophy. But it is <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> {{perpetual}} <b>failure.</b> [...] he data supplied by the physical sciences are intractable, because they are data of a lower sort than the facts they are to explain.|$|R
5|$|In the Roman Senate, Cato the Younger {{moves that}} Caesar be {{stripped}} of his command and recalled to Rome to answer charges of misusing his office and illegal warmongering. Pompey, as sole Consul present, vetoes the motion, insisting in trusting Caesar. At the theater that night, Scipio introduces his daughter Cornelia Metella to Pompey as a prospective wife, while Cato warns him that he must ally against Caesar {{before it is too}} late. Pompey again asserts that Caesar means no harm, although privately, he is troubled by Caesar's rising prestige and power and gives orders to one of his slaves who is leaving on a trip to Gaul. At night in the encampment of the 13th Legion, the Aquila (Eagle Standard) is stolen by brigands. To avoid a potentially disastrous drop in morale, Mark Antony orders Vorenus to retrieve it. As Vorenus feels the mission is <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> he has the condemned Pullo released from the stockade to assist him.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} the {{prevailing}} view {{has been that the}} very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful {{in the case of the}} other fundamental interactions — is <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> for gravity. By way of contrast, the idea of asymptotic safety retains quantum fields as the theoretical arena and instead abandons only the traditional program of perturbative renormalization.|$|E
25|$|Lviv was {{defended by}} an {{estimated}} force of 700 German aircraft. Shortly before the battle, Ivan Konev prohibited any ground action until {{the air force}} provided reliable data on enemy formations. Instead, Kamanin proposed a combination of night-time reconnaissance with a major ground attack by IL-2 units. This plan was originally considered <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> since the IL-2 was never intended for night flight, and very few Sturmovik pilots had night flight experience. Technicians modified IL-2 exhaust pipes so that exhaust would not blind pilots completely, but otherwise the operation remained a high risk. Thus, Kamanin planned to take off at night, arrive over Lviv airfields early at dusk and return after dusk.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the song}} was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> {{commercial}} <b>failure</b> in the pop charts, it went to number two for two weeks on the dance charts, spending a total of eighteen weeks on the chart. The song became a highly popular single in New York clubs where Dominatrix performed regularly, and also made waves throughout Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Not all Dark Lords {{acknowledge}} the Dark Powers directly, however. Strahd, for example, {{in his own}} memoirs, speaks only of a force known as [...] "Death," [...] who mocks him with the voices {{of his family and}} former colleagues throughout his life. Vlad Drakov, the Dark Lord of Falkovnia whose military expeditions are <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> constant <b>failure,</b> seems even <b>to</b> be totally oblivious of any non-mortal factors in his repeated defeats.|$|R
50|$|Cicero {{considered}} {{those who}} were sui amantes sine rivali (lovers of themselves without rivals) were <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> end in <b>failure</b> - a theme adopted by Francis Bacon in his condemnation of extreme self-lovers, who would burn down their own home, only to roast themselves an egg.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the next seven months, Polish forces {{successfully}} defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General Ivan Paskievich, many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{original}} {{plans for the}} enclosure of the marsh included {{the construction of a}} canal, it was not built, but there remained an intent to develop a quay on Braunton Pill, to replace the quay at Wrafton. To this end, three plots of land were bought in the 1840s, but no further progress was made, until the Bassett Estate was sold to Mr William Williams in 1852. Williams proposed a grand plan to straighten Braunton Pill, and to enclose further fringes of land, together with the area known as Horsey Island, a barren sandbank the enclosing of which Vancouver had suggested was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> in his original report of 1808. The work was to be financed by Williams, and the Marsh Inspectors, who had taken over responsibility for the marsh once {{the original}} enclosure had been completed, gave their approval.|$|E
50|$|But {{it was not}} a major {{success for}} General Mills, {{partially}} because the commercials, which many adult viewers considered annoying, actually overshadowed the cereal itself. The untimely delivery of toy dune buggies to be used in a promotion also <b>doomed</b> the cereal <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regarding Western civilization as <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> {{eventual}} <b>failure,</b> Liang did not advocate complete {{reform and}} adoption of Western institutions. He nonetheless believed that reform {{was needed to}} make China equal {{to the rest of}} the world. It was his view that the required prerequisites for these institutions did not exist in China, so they would not succeed if introduced. Instead, he pushed for change to socialism starting at the grassroots level. To this end, he founded the Shandong Rural Reconstruction Institute and helped to found the China Democratic League.|$|R
40|$|Sense-perceptions do {{not have}} to be deciphered if their {{contents}} are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are representations, not presentations. It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations, and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions or, therefore, by linguistic entities. Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend the concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol, the result being that such attempts eviscerate the very position that it is their purpose to defend. Also, it is inherent in the nature of such attempts that they assume the truth of the view that for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role. This view is demonstrably false, <b>dooming</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> the just-mentioned attempts to defend the contention that thought is in all cases mediated by linguistic symbol...|$|R
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is also {{often seen as}} relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> A famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events {{rather than by the}} realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into those who think that highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and those who think that mathematical method is potentially good even if contemporary methods have problems.|$|E
25|$|After {{contemplating the}} hijack {{of a ship}} to run the {{gauntlet}} of Bolshevik-operated coastal craft, Dunsterville decided not to risk alienating local opinion and turned back, intending to meet the party en route from Europe and make arrangements in Iran, while waiting for another chance to reach Tiflis. On 20 February, the party dodged the local authorities and returned to Hamadan, where it could use MEF and Russian army wireless stations, {{to keep in touch}} with Baghdad. It had become clear that there was little chance that the Russians formerly under Baratov could be induced to remain on service and that only Bicherakov and some of his Cossacks were willing to continue. On 11 February, Bicherakov flew to Baghdad and told Marshall that the Cossacks were willing to act as rearguard for the Russians before leaving and that the Tiflis initiative was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Marshall wanted an advance on Mosul to protect the Persian road but was over-ruled, in preference for operations in Palestine and at Hamadan, Dunsterville claimed that the Iranian public welcomed British protection and requested that he might wait at Hamadan to try again.|$|E
25|$|Gan Ning {{eventually}} {{decided to}} stop plundering and pillaging. He read some books, including ideas from the Hundred Schools of Thought. Later, he brought along 800 men to join Liu Biao, the Governor (牧) of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and was stationed in Nanyang Commandery in the province. Liu Biao had a scholarly background and was not proficient in military affairs. Around the time, chaos had broken out all around China as contending warlords fought each other for territorial gains and hegemony over the empire. Gan Ning observed that Liu Biao was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> and was worried {{that he would be}} affected, so he and his followers planned to head east towards the Wu region, which was {{under the control of the}} warlord Sun Ce and later under Sun Ce's successor, Sun Quan. They reached Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; commandery capital in present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) in the eastern part of Jing Province but were unable to cross the border into Wu territory, so Gan Ning remained at Jiangxia and became a subordinate of the commandery's Administrator (太守), Huang Zu. Huang Zu did not recognise Gan Ning's abilities and treated him coldly for three years.|$|E
40|$|The most {{significant}} {{consequence of the}} 1916 Rising was the transformation of public feeling occasioned by fifteen executions and the crude application of internment and martial law. As the Rising was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> military <b>failure,</b> its leaders knew that they would face the supreme penalty. The last letters of Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke offer a compelling lens through which to view the men’s patriotic convictions and moving personal concerns. But each document was also a final act of political defiance {{with the aim of}} altering the political consciousness of Ireland and legitimize the Rising...|$|R
50|$|Yet {{despite their}} strong-willed and {{independent}} natures, {{the people of}} Fairview took full part in the cooperative society of their times. In 1874 they enthusiastically followed church counsel and established a united order. Stock certificates (7,500 shares) were sold at $10 a share to fund the venture. But {{like most of the}} other united orders in the territory, Fairview's was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> rapid <b>failure.</b> Poor crops and undercapitalization nearly forced its demise in 1874 after only a few months of existence. Despite gallant and creative efforts to keep it alive, the order was discontinued in 1876.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causal {{relationships}} among scripts, schemata, and social norms. The authors examine how social norms are triggered by particular schemata and {{are grounded in}} scripts. Just as schemata are embedded in a network, so too are social norms, {{and they can be}} primed through spreading activation. Moreover, the expectations that allow a social norm‘s existence are inherently grounded in particular scripts and schemata. Using interventions that have targeted gender norms, open defecation, female genital cutting, and other collective issues as examples, the authors argue that ignoring the cognitive underpinnings of a social norm <b>doom</b> interventions <b>to</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R
25|$|In November 1856 Jung Bahadur Rana {{sent the}} Governor-General of India a letter {{which he had}} intercepted from Duleep Singh to Jind Kaur, {{suggesting}} that she come to England. The letter was dismissed as a forgery. However, shortly afterwards Duleep Singh commissioned Pundit Nehemiah Goreh to visit Kathmandu on his behalf {{and find out how}} his mother was managing. This attempt was also <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> and the Pundit was forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself, using the pretext of a tiger shoot in Bengal. In 1860 he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, enclosing his letter in one from Sir John Login so {{that it would not be}} intercepted or dismissed as a forgery. The Resident reported that the Rani had 'much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.' The British decided that she was no longer a threat and on 16 January 1861 she was permitted to join her son at Spence's Hotel, in Calcutta. At the time several Sikh regiments were returning home via Calcutta at the end of the Chinese war. The presence of Sikh royalty in the city gave rise to demonstrations of joy and loyalty. The hotel was surrounded by thousands of armed Sikhs and the Governor-General, Lord Canning, requested Duleep Singh, as a favour, to leave for England with his mother by the next boat.|$|E

50|$|The new car was priced on a {{par with}} the curvaceous Jaguar Mark X (albeit only the manual {{transmission}} model of the Jaguar) and 50 per cent more than its apparent predecessor the 3-litre car. It was a major change of market positioning aimed at the growing prestige and executive market in Europe and the United States, but its close appearance to its predecessor, its pricing near to that of the Jaguar, which was both bigger, with a far more advanced chassis design, more prestigious though itself without a useful market in the United States, <b>doomed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In {{these three}} lines, {{which were not}} {{inserted}} in the play, and in the preceding [...] "thought," [...] we have the key-note to Cain. [...] "Man walketh in a vain shadow"--a shadow which he can never overtake, the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition. With a being capable of infinite satisfaction, he is <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> realize <b>failure</b> in attainment. In all that is best and most enjoyable, [...] "the rapturous moment and the placid hour," [...] there is a foretaste of [...] "Death the Unknown"! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past; the tragedy of Cain, in revolt against {{the limitations of the}} inexorable present.|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} Shakespeare (or the play's revisers) {{are said to}} have used the spells of real witches in his text, purportedly angering the witches and causing them to curse the play. Thus, to say the name of the play inside a theatre is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>doom</b> the production <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> and perhaps cause physical injury or death to cast members. There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths taking place during runs of Macbeth.|$|R
500|$|Dmowski opposed revolutionary {{means of}} fighting, preferring {{political}} struggle, and aimed for independence through increased autonomy. After {{the outbreak of}} the Russo-Japanese War, Dmowski met with Colonel Akashi Motojiro, the Japanese military attache in Sweden and spy-master for Japanese intelligence activities, in Kraków in March 1904. [...] Although reluctant to collaborate with the Japanese, Dmowski agreed to Akashi's proposal that Polish soldiers in Manchuria might be encouraged to defect to the Imperial Japanese Army. [...] He travelled to Tokyo to work out the details, {{and at the same time}} made a successful effort to prevent the Japanese from aiding a rival Polish political activist, Józef Piłsudski, who wanted assistance for a planned insurrection in Poland, an aspiration which Dmowski felt would be <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
500|$|A second key {{criticism}} of the Act is that it lacked support from the business community, and thus was <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Business support for national planning and government intervention was very strong in 1933, but had collapsed by mid-1934. Many studies conclude, however, that business support for NIRA was never uniform. Larger, older businesses embraced the legislation while smaller, newer ones (more nimble in a highly competitive market and with less capital investment to lose if they failed) did not. This is a classic problem of cartels, and thus NIRA codes failed as small business abandoned the cartels. Studies of the steel, automobile manufacturing, lumber, textile, and rubber industries and the level and source {{of support for the}} NIRA tend to support this conclusion. Without the support of [...] industry, the Act could never have performed as it was intended.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} did not give up on addressing the problem when it ended subsidies. [...] It had previously commissioned {{a number of studies}} on the agricultural situation and related factors, and converted some of the results of these studies into legislation. [...] The Debt Adjustment Act of 1923 was designed to adjust farmers' debts to a level that they could actually pay, thus allowing them to carry on while still ensuring that creditors received as much as was feasible. [...] In the words of University of Calgary professor David C. Jones, the bill offered [...] "solace, but no real satisfaction". According to Jones, Greenfield's attempts to rescue southern Alberta from agricultural calamity were probably <b>doomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> [...] Even so, Greenfield had called the situation his top priority, and his failure to bring it to a successful resolution cost him politically.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{consistent}} patterns in U. S. military operations {{since the end of}} World War II has been our growing involvement in contingency operations around the world. Recognition of this significant role for our military forces has been reflected most recently in the establishment of several new commands-First Special Operations Command, USREDCOM, USCENTCOM-which exist in order to improve U. S. capability to respond to worldwide threats on short notice. Concomitantly, there is renewed interest in low-intensity conflict operations, and the Army is pursuing the development of light divisions especially designed for strategic mobility and rapid deployment. This CSI Research Survey by Lt. Col. Gary H. Wade, Rapid Deployment Logistics: Lebanon, 1958, reminds us that strategic power projection must be founded upon a responsive and synchronized logistical base. Indeed, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> provide the "tail " during short-notice contingency operations will blunt or even <b>doom</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> the sharp bite of the "teeth, " namely, the fighting forces. This detailed, comprehenisve study of the logistical planning and in-country support of the U. S. military intervention in Lebanon in 1958 is of imminent value to the U. S. Army today. Many of the issues faced by the logisticians in Beirut in 1958 are identical to those facing force developers of the light division today, such as the questions of diverting line soldiers to support duties...|$|R
