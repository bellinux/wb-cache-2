5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home.

According to one of <b>her</b> <b>doctors,</b> she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death. Distressed {{by the death of}} another sibling, the Queen, who had suffered from a heart disease most of her life, had two heart attacks in October. Both were so severe that <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> thought that she had died. When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E
5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including <b>her</b> <b>doctors,</b> believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Harper was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer. She announced on March 6, 2013, that tests from a January hospital stay revealed she has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition in which cancer cells spread into the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain. She said <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> had given her as little as three months' life expectancy. Although the disease {{was reported to be}} incurable, <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> said they were treating her with chemotherapy in an effort to slow its progress. In April 2014, Harper said she was responding well to the treatment. On July 30, 2015, Harper was hospitalized in Maine after falling unconscious, and taken via medevac to a larger hospital for further treatment. She was later discharged.|$|E
25|$|In Possessed (1947), Joan Crawford plays a {{woman who}} is taken to a {{psychiatric}} hospital in a state of shock.

Her {{family was}} informed that she was legally dead, and that as a result, life support systems would be discontinued.

In a public statement during one healing Mass on May 13, 2008, Aquino said that her blood tests indicated that she was responding well to treatment; her hair and appetite loss were apparent.|$|E
25|$|She {{suffered}} from several nervous breakdowns {{because of the}} pressure of the media and, according to Reuters, the attitude of her mother-in-law, that had resulted in particular in making her lose her voice for seven months in the 1960s and again in the fall of 1993. Empress Michiko had to cancel many of her official duties in the spring of 2007, while suffering from mouth ulcers, nosebleeds and intestinal bleeding due to psychological stress, according to <b>her</b> <b>doctors.</b> This would be similar to the situation of her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Masako, who also underwent several depressions due to the pressures of her position.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, at the XIVth All-Union Cinema Festival in Vilnius, {{the film}} {{received}} the jury's prize for popularisation of the singing art of Soviet composers, {{in the section}} of drama films. This movie was the first public exposure for Rotaru in a dramatic role. Critics lambasted the film but it garnered support from audiences {{and some of its}} themes became popular. Rotaru's next artistic period began with a new style – rock music. The film Dusha (Soul) with Rotaru's new rock band Mashina Vremeni was released in 1981, including songs by Aleksandr Zatsepin and Andrei Makarevich.

25|$|Thatcher {{suffered}} {{several small}} strokes in 2002 and was advised by <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> {{not to engage}} in any more public speaking. On 23 March, she announced the cancellation of her planned speaking engagements and that she would accept no more. But despite her illness, she pre-recorded a eulogy for the funeral of Ronald Reagan in June 2004, and attended her 80th birthday celebration in 2005 with the Queen and 650 other guests in attendance. However, her health continued to decline as the decade went on; she was briefly hospitalised in 2008 after feeling unwell during a dinner, and again after falling and fracturing her arm in 2009. In June 2009, her daughter Carol spoke to the press of her mother's struggle with dementia.|$|E
25|$|Olga, who was tradition-conscious {{and deeply}} devout, {{suffered}} a terrible blow when her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich contracted an unequal marriage in San Remo on 26 February 1891. The marriage {{was not only}} morganatic but also illegal under the statute of the Imperial Family and caused a great scandal at the Russian court. Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich was deprived of his military rank and of his position as adjutant at the Imperial Court and also forbidden to return to Russia for life. When Olga heard of her son’s morganatic marriage, she was deeply wounded and fell ill. A few days later, {{at the insistence of}} <b>her</b> <b>doctors,</b> she set out for her estate in Crimea, near the Cape of Ai-Todor, to recover her health.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} was markedly unhappy, {{in part because}} of Vivienne's health issues. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, fatigue, insomnia, migraines, and colitis. This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and <b>her</b> <b>doctors</b> for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a lunatic asylum, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom & Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film.|$|E
