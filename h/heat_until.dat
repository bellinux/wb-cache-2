25|$|The third quarter-final {{featured}} a storied and contentious rivalry. Russia played against Canada in {{a repeat of}} the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3. The opening period was a dead <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> a late goal by Maxim Afinogenov. Russia, still undefeated at the tournament, immediately overtook Canada in the second period, and led {{at one point in the}} third period by 4–0. Ilya Kovalchuk had a three-assist game and was a big boost for the Russians who won 5–2, following two late Canadian goals.|$|E

500|$|On the June 5, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Haas {{inadvertently}} knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron {{as he was}} entering the ring. It was announced on WWE's official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As {{a result of the}} legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia's onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be [...] "just friends". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and <b>Heat</b> <b>until</b> splitting in December 2006.|$|E
500|$|The Moon used {{to rotate}} {{at a faster}} rate, but early in its history, its {{rotation}} slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation {{as a result of}} frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth. With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as <b>heat,</b> <b>until</b> there was no rotation of the Moon relative to the Earth. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the [...] "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once per lunar day, during the new moon phase we observe on Earth when the near side is dark. In 2016, planetary scientists, using data collected on the much earlier Nasa Lunar Prospector mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas {{on opposite sides of the}} Moon, probably in the form of water ice. It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago, before it was tidally locked to Earth.|$|E
2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} path {{the star}} takes {{as it moves}} along the red-giant branch, that ends finally with the complete collapse of the core, depends on {{the mass of the}} star. For the Sun and stars of less than about [...] the core will become dense enough that electron degeneracy pressure will prevent it from collapsing further. Once the core is degenerate, it will continue to <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> it reaches a temperature of roughly 108K, hot enough to begin fusing helium to carbon via the triple-alpha process. Once the degenerate core reaches this temperature, the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called helium flash. In more-massive stars, the collapsing core will reach 108K before it is dense enough to be degenerate, so helium fusion will begin much more smoothly, and produce no helium flash. The core helium fusing phase of a star's life is called the horizontal branch in metal-poor stars, so named because these stars lie on a nearly horizontal line in the H–R diagram of many star clusters. Metal-rich helium-fusing stars instead lie on the so-called red clump in the H–R diagram.|$|E

50|$|Artists {{began using}} far {{greater use of}} browns when oil {{painting}} arrived in the late fifteenth century.

60|$|All {{that night}} {{and for the first}} hours of the day that followed, they went forward swiftly, camping at last to eat and sleep {{in the shadow of a}} mass of rock that looked like a {{gigantic}} castle with walls and towers. Here they remained in the burning <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> the sun began to sink once more, and then went on again, leaving some of the bearers behind them, because there was no longer water for so many. There the great men sat in patient resignation and watched them go, they who knew that having little or no water, few of them could hope to see their homes again. Still, so great was their dread of the Ghost-priests, that they never dared to murmur, or to ask that any of the store of water should be given to them, they who were but cattle to be used until they died.|$|E
60|$|The {{same order}} reappears. From the 13th to the 19th the {{temperature}} of the air steadily falls, while {{the temperature of}} the tree continues apparently to follow the course of previous variations, and does not really begin to fall, is not really affected by the ebb of <b>heat,</b> <b>until</b> the 17th, three days at least after it had been operating in the air.[49] Hence we may conclude that all variations of {{the temperature of the}} air, whatever be their period, from twenty-four hours up to twelve months, are followed in the same manner by variations in the temperature of the tree; and that those in the tree are always less in amount and considerably slower of occurrence than those in the air. This thermal sluggishness, so to speak, seems capable of explaining all the phenomena of the case without any hypothetical vital power of resisting temperatures below the freezing point, such as is hinted at even by Becquerel.|$|E
60|$|All {{this had}} {{happened}} so swiftly that until I was some thousand miles or so from the earth I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived I had neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and that I felt neither alarm nor pain. All about me I perceived that the vacancy (for I had already left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of man; but it troubled me not. The sun's rays shot through the void, powerless to light or <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> they should strike on matter in their course. I saw things with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I were God. And down below there, rushing away from me,--countless miles in a second,--where a little dark spot on the grey marked the position of London, two doctors were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell I had abandoned. I felt then such release, such serenity as I can compare to no mortal delight I have ever known.|$|E

6000|$|In that remote {{land where}} Martin was born, with its bright warm climate and rich soil, no person need go very long hungry--not {{even a small}} boy alone and lost on the great grassy plain. For {{there is a little}} useful plant in that place, with small leaves like clover leaves and a pretty yellow flower, which bears a {{wholesome}} sweet root, about as big as a pigeon's egg and of a pearly white colour. It is so well known to the settlers' children in that desert country that they are always wandering off to the plain to look for it, just as the children in a town are always running off with their halfpence to the sweet-stuff shop. This pretty white root is watery, so that it satisfies both hunger and thirst at the same time. Now when Martin woke next morning, he found a great many of the little three-leaved plants growing close to the spot where he had slept, and they supplied him with a nice sweet breakfast. After he had eaten enough and had amused himself by rolling over and over several times on the grass, he started once more on his travels, going towards the sunrise {{as fast as he could}} run. He could run well for a small boy, but he got tired at last and sat down to rest. Then he jumped up and went on again at a trot: this pace he kept up very steadily, only pausing from time to time to watch a flock of small white birds that followed him all the morning out of curiosity. At length he began to feel so hot and tired that he could only walk. Still he kept on; he could see no flowers nor anything pretty in that place--why should he stay in it? He would go on, and on, and on, in spite of the <b>heat,</b> <b>until</b> he came to something. But it grew hotter as the day advanced, and the ground about him more dry and barren and desolate, until at last he came to ground where there was scarcely a blade of grass: it was a great, barren, level plain, covered with a slight crust of salt crystals that glittered in the sun so brightly that it dazzled and pained his eyesight. Here were no sweet watery roots for refreshment, and no berries; nor could Martin find a bush to give him a little shade and protection from the burning noonday sun. He saw one large dark object in the distance, and mistaking it for a bush covered with thick foliage he ran towards it; but suddenly it started up, when he was near, and waving its great grey and white wings like sails, fled across the plain. It was an ostrich! ...|$|E
