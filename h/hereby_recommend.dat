Herein, we report 77 patients with such lesions {{in order to}} characterize their morphologic spectrum and {{the applicability of the}} International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification. In this system, malformations are structural anomalies distinguishable from tumors, which are proliferative. The radiologic images/reports and pathologic materials from all patients were reviewed. All lesions were either restricted to bone or had minimal contiguous soft tissue involvement with the exception of some multifocal lymphatic lesions that extensively affected soft tissue and/or viscera. We found that certain lesions of bone often regarded as tumors should be classified as malformations. Malformations (n = 46) were more common than tumors (n = 31); lymphatic and venous malformations were equally frequent. In the tumor category, hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioma were the most common. We also describe new vascular entities that arise in or involve bone.

40|$|Objective: The {{health status}} of most people living in {{developing}} {{countries of the world}} remains poor. Linked to this are some factors, of which low utilization of PHC facilities remain a major issue. This study therefore aimed to determine the utilization of PHC services in a sub-urban community in a developing country in West Africa. Design: The study was a descriptive cross sectional study conducted in Olorunda Local Government Area of Osun State, Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit adults above the age of 18 years, normally resident in the community. Three hundred and ninety five individuals were involved in this community-based study. Interview was conducted using semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire to obtain relevant information. Result: Most (71. 7 %) of respondents were aware of PHC facilities in their communities and the most frequently mentioned health service provided was the immunization service. Three quarters of respondents felt that PHC services were accessible while over half (57. 2 %) felt it could address the disease burden in the community. Only 44. 1 % of them had ever-utilized any PHC health facility within the district. Respondents ' age, sex, marital status, educational level and occupation are all significantly related to utilization status.

40|$|Background: Microsporidial stromal {{keratitis}} poses several diagnostic challenges. Patients {{may present}} with corneal ulceration, marked stromal thinning, {{or even as}} a quite corneal scar. The presentation of microsporidial stromal keratitis commonly mimics viral keratitis. Microbiology scrapings are usually helpful; however, scraping and culture-negative cases pose a significant diagnostic dilemma. Histopathological examination is diagnostic but shows varying degree of inflammation, predominantly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Granulomatous inflammation, in microsporidial stromal keratitis, is never well described, and the authors in this article aim to describe the presence of granulomatous inflammation in microsporidial stromal keratitis, in patients with associated herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. Methods: This was a retrospective and observational study conducted at a tertiary eye care center. Results: Of 263 patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for infectious keratitis, during 2011 – 2013, seven patients were diagnosed as microsporidial stromal keratitis. Microsporidial spores could be demonstrated on microbiological scrapings in 5 / 7 (71 %) of cases, but identified on histopathological examination and also confirmed on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for microsporidium in 100 % of cases. There was evidence of diffuse stromal necrosis with markedly severe degree of polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates, with granulomatous inflammation in 42 % of cases. Interestingly, these were positive for HSV- 1 DNA on PCR. Review of medical records revealed much severe clinical presentations in patients with granulomatous inflammation, in comparison to cases without granulomatous inflammation. Conclusions: The authors <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> that severe clinical presentation in patients with microsporidial stromal keratitis, markedly dense polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates or the presence of granulomatous inflammation on the histopathological examination, should be investigated further {{for the presence of}} HSV- 1 DNA for better patient management and good visual outcome...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tonsillectomy, {{a common}} {{paediatric}} otolaryngology procedure, has undergone several evolutionary {{trends in the}} surgical techniques aimed at minimizing complications and improving patients′ satisfaction. Despite the technological advancements in this respect, search for an ideal method is still ongoing, and some authorities are reverting back to the conventional methods. We wish to introduce the "Vasoconstrictive hydrolytic cold dissection" (VHCD) method. Patients and Methods: The VHCD method was described, and the outcome measures in one hundred and thirty-five patients who had the procedures were presented in. Data entrance was done with SPSS 14. Results: A total 135 patients comprising of 107 children aged 1 - 12 years and 28 adolescents/adults aged 14 - 52 years were operated upon using the VHCD between March 2009 and July 2012 by the same teams of Surgeons and Anaesthetists. The average surgical time and blood volume losses were 15 minutes and 5 mls for children and 12 mins and 10 mls for adults/adolescents, respectively. There was a single case (0. 7 %) of post-tonsillar bleed (reactionary haemorrhage). The rest (99. 3 %) recorded nil haemorrhage within and beyond first 2 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions: Surgeons used to other techniques of tonsillectomies may not revert to the cold steel; however, those practicing CSM will benefit from VHCD. We <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> this simple, cost-effective modification of the cold steel tonsillectomy, which appears to have made dissection easier and also minimizes haemorrhage, a common complication of tonsillectomy surgery. It is timely in the advent of increased advocacy towards reversal to the conventional method of tonsillectomy. A randomized control trial is required for further evaluation of this method...|$|E

There were no sex differences in all these parameters. Serum levels of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TC/HDL-C in the 3 age groups were also statistically similar (p> 0. 05). Concentrations of TG and VLDL-C were lower (p&# 60; 0. 001) in group II than in I. These values were also significantly lower (p&# 60; 0. 02) in group III than in I. Serum TG and VLDL-C in groups II and III were statistically comparable (p> 0. 05). Conclusion : Serum concentrations of TC, TG and VLDL-C decrease with advancing age, with more marked decrease between first and second years of life. We <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> that the reference values established in this study be utilized for the interpretation of serum lipid results in pre-school children in Nigerian hospitals and possibly elsewhere in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Ascertaining {{the burden}} of {{maternal}} mortality {{is crucial to the}} improvement of maternal health for any nation. It provides basis to evolve comprehensive strategies to enhance mothers’ health. A facility-based survey was carried out in Abia State southeast Nigeria in 2003 to determine the magnitude of maternal deaths and where they occur in the State. Health facilities in the 17 local government areas of the State were enlisted. Data on births and maternal deaths in the preceding 12 months were obtained. A total of 25, 081 births and 43 maternal deaths were recorded for the study period giving maternal mortality rate of 171 / 100, 000. The public facilities had higher value of maternal mortality rate (856. 8 / 100, 000) than the private (177. 2 / 100, 000). Similarly, the Comprehensive Essential Obstetric Care facilities had lower maternal mortality rate than the Non-Essential Obstetric Care. Poor documentation {{may be one of the}} reasons for the low maternal mortality rate in this study. Enforcing proper documentation, reporting and investigation of maternal deaths is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended.</b>  </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{intends to}} make an {{analysis}} of the Industrial arbitration panel as an institution for Trade dispute resolution in Nigeria under the Trade Dispute Act of 1990. Subsequently, an examination into the defects that has rendered the institution ineffective will be made and thereafter to proffer solution with a view to re-shaping the machinery for Trade dispute resolution in Nigeria. A comparative study of the dispute settlement mechanism in South Africa, Tanzania and the United Kingdom would be carefully appraised with a view to highlighting distinctive features common to these institutions. Furthermore, a reflection on the status of the Industrial Arbitration Panel after the National Industrial Court Act of 2006 and under the new constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (third alteration) Act 2010. It is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended</b> that the Industrial Arbitration Panel should be re-established in both structure and operations as a commission, independent of the state, political party, trade union or minister. More so, an independent body will hasten the ease of redress for workers in trade dispute settlement...|$|R
30|$|Enyigba in {{south-eastern}} Nigeria {{is one of}} {{the agrarian}} communities facing water scarcity challenges. The open cast mining activities in the region are also compounding the water problems as a result of leakage of heavy metals that pollute the limited water resources. This study is conducted to document the current state of surface water contamination by heavy metals and its impact on domestic and agricultural uses. Thirty water samples were collected from five sources at both the upstream, middle stream and downstream of each of the selected sites. The heavy metals were analysed using the standard laboratory methods. Generally, the average concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the studied water bodies were 17.68, 4.30, 3.14, 0.05 and 35.57  mg/l, respectively, which were above the WHO permissible limit. Contamination of water above WHO permissible limits with heavy metals in the surface waters, because of open cast mining, is considered a serious threat to both domestic and agricultural usage. The need for establishment of treatment facility, periodic monitoring of heavy metal levels, recycling plants and principal technologies to monitor the mine sites are <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of the food deficient phenomena in many localities proved that aggregative progress in food security does not necessarily guarantee the attainment of local food security in every village of the country. Anticipating that fact, therefore, this research was conducted to identify possible intervention strategies for intervening local social capacity in self-strengthening local food security system at village level based on selected typological character of village samples in Central Java. Four poor villages representing village typology were selected purposively to represent both the food-exporting and food-importing areas. Based on human right based approach, this comparative research found out a set of significantly different strategies in developing local capacity in food security through both demand and supply management. Supply capacity of exporting village must be strengthened through effective supply and storage system, whereas demand-based importing village capacity must be strengthened through income protection and management to improve purchasing power in meeting daily need for imported food. In addition, local empowerment centralized on institutional capacity building is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended</b> for both the food exporting and importing villages to enable local institution to be skillful in resource mapping, effective in advocating people participation, and powerfill in facilitating participative decision making...|$|R
