40|$|Sunlight {{inactivation}} {{rates of}} somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages (F-RNA phages), and <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> were compared in seven summer and three winter survival experiments. Experiments were conducted outdoors, using 300 -liter 2 % (vol/vol) sewage-seawater mixtures held in open-top chambers. Dark inactivation rates (kDs), measured from exponential survival curves in enclosed (control) chambers, were higher in summer (temperature range: 14 to 20 °C) than in winter (temperature range: 8 to 10 °C). Winter kDs were highest for <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> and lowest for F-RNA phages but {{were the same}} or similar for all three indicators in summer. Sunlight inactivation rates (kS), {{as a function of}} cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were all higher than the kDs with a consistent kS ranking (from greatest to least) as follows: <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms,</b> F-RNA phages, and somatic coliphages. Phage inactivation was exponential, but bacterial curves typically exhibited a shoulder. Phages from raw sewage exhibited kSs similar to those from waste stabilization pond effluent, but raw sewage <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> were inactivated faster than pond effluent <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms.</b> In an experiment which included F-DNA phages and Bacteroides fragilis phages, the kS ranking (from greatest to least) was as follows: <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms,</b> F-RNA phages, B. fragilis phages, F-DNA phages, and somatic coliphages. In a 2 -day experiment which included enterococci, the initial concentration ranking (from greatest to least: <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms,</b> enterococci, F-RNA phages, and somatic coliphages) was reversed during sunlight exposure, with only the phages remaining detectable by the end of day 2. Inactivation rates under different optical filters decreased with the increase in spectral cutoff wavelength (50 % light transmission) and indicated that F-RNA phages and <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> are more susceptible than somatic coliphages to longer solar wavelengths, which predominate in seawater. The consistently superior survival of somatic coliphages in our experiments suggests that they warrant further consideration as fecal, and possibly viral, indicators in marine waters...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} {{is in progress}} since January 2001 in order to analyze the effect of grazing and manure spreading on microbial pollution of groundwater in carbonate aquifers. The {{research is}} carrying out through laboratory and field experiments in different test sites of Southern Italy. The results suggest that fecal enterococci are more reliable than <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> as indicator organisms of microbial contamination of groundwater. In carbonate Southern Apennines this difference in reliability is strongly conditioned by meteorological and pedological factors. The soil medium, which has a pyroclastic origin, causes a retention of <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> {{higher than that of}} fecal enterococci. This phenomenon is non-uniform at field scale and can reach a difference of an order of magnitude.

40|$|Abstract Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a gram negative, rod-shaped, facultative {{anaerobic}} bacterium, it is normally {{found in the}} lower intestines of warm-blooded animals and humans.

The purpose of this experiment is to identify the prevalence of E. coli and <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> on the bottom of backpacks belonging to college students in central Kentucky. Forty samples were taken from bottoms of college students’ backpacks in central Kentucky. Sterile swabs were used to collect the samples from the backpacks. The swabs were placed in Stuart’s transport medium and arrived at the lab within 2 hours.

They also indicated the prevalence of A. hydrophila as compared to <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms,</b> and suggested that water from the Mfoundi River and its tributaries could be classified as hypereutrophic based on the density of Aeromonas. Moreover, the spatial distribution of <b>fecal</b> <b>coliforms</b> and A. hydrophila exhibited similar trends within the different water bodies investigated, suggesting that A. hydrophila can be used as indicator of water quality in highly polluted waters.
