5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer {{disconnected from the}} actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E

25|$|The {{concluding}} chapter (x) {{regulates the}} relations between joint owners and neighbors, in dwellings and in fields. The last case mentioned is especially <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> showing a highly developed state of agricultural jurisdiction in the Mishnaic days.|$|E
50|$|At its {{railroad}} crossing near I-83, Calvert Street {{once had}} an arch-style bridge, though not <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> looking <b>as</b> {{the one on}} nearby Howard Street. The present crossing on Calvert Street is ordinary-looking.|$|R
60|$|But {{instead he}} found {{something}} very different, though {{in its way}} quite <b>as</b> <b>interesting,</b> for <b>as</b> he rounded the rugged bluff he {{came face to face}} with two evil-looking fellows astride stocky, rough-coated ponies.|$|R

25|$|The unique {{rheology}} of nanocellulose dispersions {{was recognized}} by the early investigators. The high viscosity at low nanocellulose concentrations makes nanocellulose very <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> a non-caloric stabilizer and gellant in food applications, the major field explored by the early investigators.|$|E
25|$|The Iron Heel is <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> {{an example}} of a dystopian novel that anticipates and {{influenced}} George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. London's socialist politics are explicitly on display here. The Iron Heel meets the contemporary definition of soft science fiction. The Star Rover (1915) is also science fiction.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, North Carolina Playwright Keith Smith wrote a one-act musical play titled My Name is Johnny Appleseed, {{which is}} {{presented}} to school children {{to show that the}} true story of John Chapman is just as <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the mythical figure, who is shrouded in legend and fable.|$|E

25|$|Patellifolia is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} subfamily Betoideae of the plant family Amaranthaceae. These are mostly procumbent herbs occurring in the Western Mediterranean region and Macaronesia, with some isolated occurrences in North Africa and at the Horn of Africa. They are <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> crop wild relatives of sugar beet.|$|E
25|$|The next work he {{produced}} was in 1764 on the libration of the Moon, and an {{explanation as to}} why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of virtual work. His solution is especially <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780.|$|E
25|$|Fortescue {{remarked that}} the medieval {{explanations}} are <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> showing with what reverence people studied {{the text of}} the Canon and how, when every one had forgotten the original reasons for its forms, they still kept the conviction that the Mass is full of venerable mysteries and that all its clauses mean more than common expressions. He added that in this conviction the sometimes naive medieval interpreters were eminently right.|$|E

500|$|Norman Howe {{reviewed}} Adventure in The Space Gamer No. 31. Howe {{commented that}} [...] "Adventure {{is a good}} game, as video games are measured. It is neither <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> nor <b>as</b> complex as Superman, but it shows great promise for things to come. If {{you have access to}} the Atari game computer, it is an entertaining cartridge to have." ...|$|R

25|$|Tuse Church near Holbæk {{in northwestern}} Zealand is richly {{decorated}} with both Romanesque and late Gothic murals. It is however the latter which {{are regarded as}} possibly the finest works of the Isefjord artists who were most active from 1460 to 1480. The pictures depict stories from the Old and New Testaments but the life of Jesus is particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> it combines the biblical accounts with images of kings, devils and women brewing beer.|$|E
25|$|In placental species, parent-offspring {{conflict}} {{can result}} {{in the evolution of}} strategies, such as genomic imprinting, for embryos to subvert maternal nutrient provisioning. Despite several attempts to find it, genomic imprinting has not been found in the platypus, reptiles, birds or fish. The absence of genomic imprinting in a placental reptile, the southern grass skink, is <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> genomic imprinting was thought {{to be associated with the}} evolution of viviparity and placental nutrient transport.|$|E
25|$|Beet (Beta vulgaris) has {{an immense}} {{economic}} importance as sugar crop (Sugar beet), {{and a great}} importance as a vegetable (Chard, Beetroot), and as fodder plant (Mangelwurzel). This species is also used as medicinal plant, ornamental plant, dye and as renewable resource. It is the crop species with the highest economical value in the order Caryophyllales. Therefore, the members of Beta and the related genus Patellifolia are <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> Crop wild relatives.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} and grounds have a rather <b>interesting</b> history, <b>as</b> they are intrinsically {{linked to the}} development of the village from its formative years.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the influence of the Panchatantra is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the Tantropakhyana. Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of this work exist, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil, Lao, Thai and Old Javanese. The frame story is particularly <b>interesting,</b> <b>as</b> it follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories {{in order to maintain the}} interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the Panchatantra—with its original Indian setting.|$|E
25|$|Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn {{believes}} that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> well as {{if we continue to}} study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), {{we would be able to}} separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.|$|E
25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in {{innovative ways to}} reach out to the voters. Although SMS had been used during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice was the way {{to reach out to}} the rural community as they could speak their language. This turned out to be very <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E

25|$|In human SOD {{the active}} metal is copper, as Cu(II) or Cu(I), coordinated tetrahedrally by four {{histidine}} residues. This enzyme also contains zinc ions for stabilization and is activated by copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS). Other isozymes may contain iron, manganese or nickel. Ni-SOD is particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> it involves nickel(III), an unusual oxidation state for this element. The active site nickel geometry cycles from square planar Ni(II), with thiolate (Cys2 and Cys6) and backbone nitrogen (His1 and Cys2) ligands, to square pyramidal Ni(III) with an added axial His1 side chain ligand.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the recording and reproducing heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the concept}} to make the new quarter more <b>interesting,</b> <b>as</b> well as accessible, a new tram circuit was {{constructed}} around the quarter, using two heritage trams on a 1.5km $8 million clockwise track. It is hoped that the tram line will later be extended, to serve transport as well as tourist functions for the quarter. Such a link, initially to the Britomart Transport Centre was originally intended to form {{part of the}} initial works, but the global financial crisis scuttled plans to make the new Wynyard Crossing substantial enough to also serve trams, though the foundations for the interim bridge will be sufficient for a later bridge upgrade.|$|E
