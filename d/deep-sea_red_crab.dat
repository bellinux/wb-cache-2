Historical information {{dating back to the}} late 1970 's has been examined, but most of the data analysed in this study have been collected since 1980. Most of the research has been conducted on red crab. Four aspects of its biology have been examined in some detail, namely its reproduction, growth, movements and causes of its specific dep t h zonation off Namibia. These (particularly the first two) aspects have been used, together with information from commercial sampling and catch statistics, to examine possible changes in the yield-per-recruit should the age at first capture be increased, or fishing effort reduced. On the basis of these results, some management options are presented. Several techniques (photography, trawling, effective fishing area and tag-recapture) have been used to examine the abundance and density of red crab off Namibia, and are critically compared. Research on the stone crab has been largely restricted to an analysis of commercial catch data, though an unusual symbiotic relationship with a liparid fish has been identified and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} structure of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> (Chaceon quinquedens) in a nearly unexploited state is compared with its condition {{three decades later}} {{after more than a}} decade of sustained harvesting. Our study is based on a camera and net trawl survey conducted in 1974, which we repeated between 2003 and 2005 on the southern New England shelf break. Although the overall biomass of red crabs was estimated to be higher than in 1974, the abundance of large males, which are targeted by the fishery, was considerably lower. In particular, the biomass of large males (114 mm carapace width), considered in 1974 to be marketable, declined by 42 %. Declines were most evident at depths and regions most accessible to the fishing fleet based in southern New England. With the change in fishery selectivity towards smaller male crabs, the abundance of currently harvestable crabs is about equal to 1974 levels. No declines were observed in the biomass of female and smaller male crabs not targeted by the fishery. Indeed, the abundance of juveniles appears considerably higher than in 1974. Perhaps, adverse effects on reproduction attributable to a reduction in the numbers of large males may be a consequence of fishing, but fishery impacts and productivity are difficult to assess because key biological information is lacking...|$|E

40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|E

50|$|Overall, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities.

Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity.

The number of food items decreased significantly from March to September at 150 and 200 m depth, the only strata compared since <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> are usually absent from the coast above 100 m in summer. The particulate organic matter (POM) varied from 60 to 70 % of total food items. The zooplankton fraction, mainly crustaceans, foraminiferans, and radiolarians, was second in importance. Phytoplankton was the next most important group, and was represented by 17 genera in March and 11 in September. The mean number of diatoms in stomachs per station decreased significantly (73. 5 versus 7) from March to September. The number of genera/station showed the same pattern (5. 36 versus 3. 6).

40|$|Red crab (Chaceon sp.) fishery {{resources}} {{exist on}} both sides on the North Atlantic, and the fisheries that harvest these resources seek to maintain their sustainability. This study contributed {{to the body of}} knowledge of the resource in the western Atlantic resource and <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> fishery off the Northeast US coast, and of the resource in the eastern Atlantic and emerging <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> fishery in the Cape Verde Islands off West Africa. ^ One aspect of this study assessed the characteristics of sea-sampled catches in the western and eastern Atlantic as indicators of population characteristics. In the western Atlantic, I investigated the past and current status of the population, changes in the size distribution of the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> population due to fishing and the effects of discarding. I used data from a tagging study initiated in 2010 and 2004 - 2005 trawl survey by Dr. Richard Wahle of the University of Maine. I have supplemented these data with National Marine Fisheries Service trawl-survey data from 1974, and data that I collected in the summer of 2012 and 2013 aboard <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> commercial fishing vessels. In the eastern Atlantic, I used data collected during four exploratory fishing trips on a virgin resource located in the Cape Verde Islands. ^ In general, the life history characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> resources are similar in the western and eastern Atlantic in terms of carapace width and size-frequency distribution. Males are always larger than females. In the western Atlantic I found {{that there has been a}} size increase in the harvested male population between 2010 and 2012, and I hypothesize that this could be due to a decrease in fishing effort overall, or is a response to an effort to return the smaller males to the sea. I also documented that there is a discard mortality of male and female <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> but the level of this mortality is small, and interestingly, corresponds to a level reported by a previous researcher based on 2 ̆ 2 hotel experiments. 2 ̆ 2 The fishery in the western Atlantic, although certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, experiences the effects of moderate fishing intensity on males, and is considered fully exploited. I observed a change in the selectivity of fishermen when sorting the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> catch from the trap, as the discard probability function has become steeper and resembles a more knife-edge selection process. ^ As for male <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> the result of a length-based catch curve analysis (LCCA) indicates evidence of higher fishing mortality (F) in recent years (2012) for the northern area (F = 0. 47) compared to the southern area (F = 0. 20). Although this finding reflects the current fishery status, the estimated F value might be overestimated due to the more selective nature of trap surveys (the catch is aggregated toward the mean carapace width) and these values are valid only for the localized areas (600 - 800 meters) where the fishing operations occur. Although there has been concern regarding mating success of females due to lack of large males, I found no evidence to support this hypothesis. I found that the probability of successful mating in the logistic model increases as a carapace width increases. I also made a comparison of mating success from the 1974 to the 2004 - 05 surveys for the southern area, and that indicates a higher probability of mating success in the more recent years. ^ I separated the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> population in the northwest Atlantic into two sub-stocks, with Hudson Canyon as a biogeographic barrier dividing the population along the upper continental slope off New England (north) and the mid-Atlantic (south), so as to be able to differentiate effects of fishing on the older mature fishery in the north and east form the newer fishery in the south. The results of a biomass dynamic model used to estimate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) found that the total MSY is estimated to be 1797 mt; this level is slightly higher than the current Total Allowable Landing (TAL) that was set at 1775 mt. The average fishing mortality in the northern area (0. 13) was lower than that in the southern area (0. 17), and both values are lower than the values estimated form the LCCA analysis. The F/FMSY and B/BMSY ratios from north and south areas indicate that the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> resource is neither overfished nor is overfishing occurring in the most recent year (2012).

Both capelin and lumpsucker are commercially important species in the Norwegian fisheries, but capelin {{is also a very}} important forage fish for other species. The egg guarding lumpsucker male was not able to protect his eggs from the egg feeding <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> Approximately 8 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs contained lumpsucker eggs in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, capelin eggs occurred in 10 % and 23 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs and capelin in 82 % and 22 % respectively. As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for lumpsucker in <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003. The uncertainty in stomach data generated most of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimated consumption of fish eggs by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> This study has established new knowledge about fish egg predation by the invasive red king and egg cannibalism in capelin. Mortality in capelin eggs caused by cannibalism and egg consumption by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> may influence mortality of eggs, but is not considered to hamper capelin recruitment.

Nina Mikkelsen and Torstein Pedersen: 'Invasive <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> feed on both capelin and their eggs' (manuscript) Mortality of demersal fish eggs caused by predation was investigated in this research project. The selected prey species were the Barents Sea capelin Mallotus villosus and lumpsucker Cyclopterus lumpus L, while the selected predators were capelin itself by cannibalistic behaviour and the invasive <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> Paralithodes camtschaticus. Both capelin and lumpsucker are commercially important species in the Norwegian fisheries, but capelin is also a very important forage fish for other species. The egg guarding lumpsucker male was not able to protect his eggs from the egg feeding <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> Approximately 8 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs contained lumpsucker eggs in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, capelin eggs occurred in 10 % and 23 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs and capelin in 82 % and 22 % respectively. As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for lumpsucker in <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003. The uncertainty in stomach data generated most of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimated consumption of fish eggs by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> This study has established new knowledge about fish egg predation by the invasive red king and egg cannibalism in capelin. Mortality in capelin eggs caused by cannibalism and egg consumption by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> may influence mortality of eggs, but is not considered to hamper capelin recruitment. Recruitment of lumpsucker on the other hand, may be hampered by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> that chase away the egg guarding male, damage and feed on his eggs...|$|R
