40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} of exhaled breath contains important {{information regarding the}} health of our body. Measurements of the level of exhaled carbon dioxide can help both diagnose respiratory diseases and determine metabolic rate. A low-cost NDIR sensor has been developed that offers the detection of CO 2 from the ppm range up to 5 % level in human breath. An innovative lock-in amplifier system allows a 10 Hz drive signal to be recovered from the high frequency noise associated with a silicon thermopile infra-red detector. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated excellent stability (± 0. 10 % in 25 % RH) and repeatability between dry and humid conditions (± 1. 2 % for 25 % humidity increase). The response time is typically 2. 4 s, limited by the low drive frequency necessary for the MEMS-based wideband <b>infra-red</b> <b>source.</b> The current system has a resolution of ca. 10 ppm of CO 2. Further refinement in signal processing and a higher drive frequency should permit even lower concentrations of CO 2 to be detected with an ultimate target of 1 ppm.

We present new sub{{millimetre}} and millimetre continuum {{observations of}} NGC 2264, {{in the region}} of Allen’s <b>infra-red</b> <b>source</b> IRS 1, at 350, 450, 800 and 1300 µm taken with the 15 -m JCMT and the IRAM 30 -m MRT. We observe a ridge of bright submillimetre and millimetre emission which we designate NGC 2264 MM. Within this ridge we have discovered a cluster of five submillimetre sources which we label NGC 2264 MMS 1 – 5. The masses of the sources lie in the range ∼ 10 – 50 M ⊙ and each source has a FWHM of ≤ 0. 1 pc. The total mass of the ridge is ∼ 730 M⊙. We identify MMS 3 as harbouring the driving source of a previously discovered bipolar outflow. We note that MMS 5 is positionally coincident with a previously discovered HST nearir source, but we conclude that this is a chance alignment, since typical extinction values within the ridge lie in the range AV ∼ 200 - 1600. The cluster which we have discovered is of higher mass and extends over a larger area than the low-mass sub-cluster discovered by the HST surrounding IRS 1. Our continuum maps show a greater dynamic range than molecular spectral line maps, due to gas freezing out onto dust grains at the densities of these sources. We suggest that each of the sources MMS 1 – 5 is forming one or more intermediate or high mass stars. Key words: stars: formation – ISM: dust, extinction – Galaxy...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 115 - 116. Cracks {{and surface}} {{imperfections}} in railway track are important when considering its lifetime. This thesis investigates {{the feasibility of}} a new electro-optic technique which records surface irregularities on a track. It is more sensitive to crack detection than the traditional trailing wheel method and approximately one thousand times less expensive than the highly sensitive ultrasonic technique used by British Rail. The electro-optic method consists of an optical projection-detection system with two mutually oblique axes. Light projected onto the rail is reflected and imaged onto a split photocell. A depression or rise in the reflective surface causes the axis of focus to shift and more light falls {{on one of the}} photocells. The difference in optical power between the two photocells is therefore a quantitative measure of displacement and consequently rail surface profile. The intention is to fix the device onto a bogey of a train so that measurements are taken as it moves over the track at speeds of up to 40 ms- 1. The relationship between vertical displacement and differential optical power is dependent on the shape and size of the spot. It is nonlinear for a circular spot and imperfections spanning less than 1 mm vertically can be resolved. Vertical displacements greater than 5 mm cannot be detected solely using the difference in optical power and the nett power falling on both photocells must be considered in addition. An investigation into the reflective properties of rail lead to the optics being configured for specular reflection. The angles of incidence and reflection are optimally set at 35 °. In addition, the use of an <b>infra-red</b> <b>source</b> is found to be an added advantage...|$|E

This means that point source contamination will not severely degrade the cleanest Planck channels unless current source count estimates are off by an order of magnitude.

40|$|Rats {{can readily}} {{be trained to}} jump a gap of around 16 cm {{in the dark and}} a {{considerably}} larger gap in the light for a food reward. In the light, they use vision to estimate the distance to be jumped. In the dark, they use their vibrissae at the farthest distances. Bilateral whisker shaving or barrel field lesions reduce the gap crossed in the dark by about 2 cm. Information from the barrel fields reaches motor areas via cortico-cortical, basal ganglia, or cerebellar pathways. The cells of origin of the ponto-cerebellar pathway are segregated in layer Vb of the barrel field. Efferent axons of Vb cells occupy a central position within the basis pedunculi and terminate on cells in the pontine nuclei. Pontine cells, in turn, project to the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. We trained normal rats to cross a gap in the light and in a dark alley that was illuminated with an <b>infra-red</b> <b>source.</b> When the performance was stable, we made unilateral lesions in the central region of the basis pedunculi, which interrupted connections from the barrel field to the pons while leaving cortico-cortical and basal ganglia pathways intact. Whisking was not affected on either side by the lesion, and the rats with unilateral peduncle lesions crossed gaps of the same distance as they did pre-operatively. Shaving the whiskers {{on the side of the}} face that retains its input to the pontine nuclei reduced the maximal gap jumped in the dark by the same amount as bilateral whisker shaving. Performance in the light was not affected. Regrowth of the shaved whiskers was associated with the recovery of the maximum distance crossed in the dark. In control cases, shaving the whiskers on the other side of the face did not reduce the distance jumped in the dark or in the light. These results suggest that the cerebellum must receive whisker information from the barrel fields for whisker-guided jumps...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuations of the gamma-ray {{background}} (GRB) are investigated. It {{is assumed}} that the GRB is produced by discrete sources. Two basic classes of objects as dominant contributors to the GRB are considered: a) blazars and b) starburst galaxies. Predicted log N − log S counts are calculated for these two models. In both cases strong cosmic evolution is needed to produce a substantial fraction of the observed GRB. Since on the average blazars are several orders of magnitude more luminous than starburst galaxies, their number required to saturate the GRB is {{much smaller than the}} number of starburst galaxies. In effect, fluctuations of the GRB in the blazar model are relatively high.

40|$|Recent rapid {{development}} of cost-effective, accurate digital imaging sensors, high-speed computational hardware, and tractable design software {{has given rise}} to the growing field of augmented reality in the computer vision realm. The system design of a 'Digital Whiteboard' system is presented with the intention of realizing a practical, cost-effective and publicly available spatial augmented reality system. A Microsoft Kinect sensor and a PC projector coupled with a desktop computer form a type of spatial augmented reality system that creates a projection based graphical user interface that can turn any wall or planar surface into a 'Digital Whiteboard'.

40|$|Intense {{pulses of}} light with {{wavelengths}} approximately ten times smaller than microwave sources {{and a hundred}} times larger than optical/near <b>infra-red</b> <b>sources</b> may be categorized as high-field Terahertz (THz) sources. By virtue of their large electromagnetic field amplitudes and relatively long wavelengths, they are uniquely amenable for electron acceleration, coherent X-ray generation and non-linear spectroscopy. Intra-pulse difference frequency generation or optical rectification of ultrafast optical pump pulses in nonlinear crystals {{has emerged as the}} most efficient approach for high-field THz generation. Earlier theoretical treatment of these systems had predicted conversion efficiencies as high as 10 %, which opened up the possibility of generating THz pulses with energies on the order of 10 milli joules on a table-top. However, experimental demonstrations have achieved conversion efficiencies of only a few percent which motivates a re-examination of the existing theory. In this thesis, we re-formulate the problem by accounting for effects, previously not considered. These include: (i) the spatio-temporal distortions of ultrafast pulses, (ii) the nonlinear coupled interaction of optical and THz radiation in two spatial dimensions (2 -D), (iii) self-phase modulation, (iv) stimulated Raman scattering and (v) crystal geometry. The key finding is that THz generation necessarily leads to broadening of the optical pump spectrum, resulting in a rapid spatio-temporal break-up of the pulse which limits further generation of THz radiation. Due to this self-limiting mechanism, the predicted conversion efficiencies reduce significantly in relation to earlier predictions, which is in line with experimental trends. Guidelines to optimize conversion efficiency and their ramifications on spatial and spectral properties of THz radiation are discussed. The predictions and analyses are supported by experiments. These findings direct future work towards careful engineering of such systems to achieve optimal THz pulse properties and the conception of approaches to circumvent the aforementioned self-limiting effects. by Koustuban Ravi.

Based on a long ignored aspect that <b>infra-red</b> (IR) <b>source</b> for commonly used lidars lies in the response range of regular cam-eras, we employ an auxiliary IR filter (blocking natu-ral light and letting IR pass) in order for camera to image the scan traces of lidar by prolonging exposure time. Then by scanning V-shaped target such as the in-tersection of two smooth walls, corresponding lines (or points) on scan plane and image are found through line fitting. With these high confident correspondences, ex-trinsic parameters (known camera) or a planar homog-raphy (unknown camera) can easily be calculated. Fur-thermore, two evaluation methods, namely line align-ment error and two-view point alignment error, are de-veloped.
