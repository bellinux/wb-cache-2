5|$|While under American command on 16 November 1944, the {{division}} went on another offensive, taking Stolberg and pushing on against heavy resistance. Eschweiler fell on 21 November and {{the enemy was}} cleared from the area west of the <b>Inde</b> River, including Inden by 2 December 1944. Lucherberg was held against enemy counterattacks on 3 December, and all strongholds west of the Roer River were captured by the 23rd. It took temporary command of the 60th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division. During the Battle of the Bulge, the 104th actively defended its sector near Duren and Merken from 15 December 1944 to 22 February 1945. During that time, it was reassigned to XIX Corps of the Ninth United States Army. It then moved across the Roer taking Huchem-Stammeln, Birkesdorf, and North Duren. On 5 March, after heavy fighting, it entered Köln. After defending {{the west bank of}} the Rhine River, {{the division}} crossed the river at Honnef on 22 March 1945, and attacked to the east of the Remagen bridgehead. During this time, some of the division's assets fell under command of the 1st Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division. After a period of mopping up and consolidation, it participated in the trap of enemy troops in the Ruhr pocket. The 104th repulsed heavy attacks near Medebach and captured Paderborn on 1 April 1945. After regrouping, it advanced to the east and crossed the Weser River on 8 April, blocking enemy exits from the Harz Mountains. The division then crossed the Saale River and took Halle in a bitter five-day struggle from 15 to 19 April. The sector to the Mulde River was cleared by 21 April, and after vigorous patrolling, contacted the Red Army at Pretzsch on 26 April. The division took temporary command of assets from the 69th Infantry Division in early May.|$|E

40|$|Histoire des deux <b>Indes,</b> {{was arguably}} {{the first major}} example of a world history, {{exploring}} the ramifications of European colonialism from a global perspective. Frequently reprinted and translated into many languages, its readers included statesmen, historians, philosophers and writers throughout Europe and North America. Underpinning the encyclopedic scope of the work was an extensive transnational network of correspondents and informants assiduously cultivated by Raynal to obtain the latest expert knowledge. How these networks shaped Raynalâs writing and what they reveal about eighteenth-century intellectual sociability, trade and global interaction is the driving theme of this current volume. From text-based analyses of the anthropology that structures Raynalâs history of human society to articles that examine new archival material relating to his use of written and oral sources, contributors to this book explore among other topics: â¢ how the Histoire created a forum for intellectual interaction and collaboration; â¢ how Raynal created and manipulated his own image as a friend to humanity as a promotional strategy; â¢ Raynalâs intellectual debts to contemporary economic theorists; â¢ the transnational associations of booksellers involved in marketing the Histoire; â¢ the Histoire âs reception across Europe and North America and its long-lasting influence on colonial historiography and political debate well into the nineteenth century.

25|$|The {{advance of}} the 104th Division went {{somewhat}} better. The unit secured the left flank of VII Corps between the First and the Ninth US Army. The target of the unit was the industrial triangle at Eschweiler-Weisweiler and the Eschweiler woods at Stolberg. This part of the front was dominated by the Donnerberg near the identical named village. The division faced the German 12th VGD {{as well as the}} 3rd Panzergrenadier Division. During the first days heavy fighting ensued at the Donnerberg, but by 19 November the important hill was in American hands. After that, the division renewed its drive and headed for Stolberg and Eschweiler simultaneously. Stolberg was taken on the same day, but German resistance at Eschweiler was heavy, so the Americans attempted to encircle the town. This worked and the German command decided to withdraw from the town, abandoning it to the 104th Division. The division then advanced alongside the western bank of the <b>Inde</b> River. Heavy fighting ensued, and the 12th VGD fought to its near destruction, until it was replaced by the incoming 3rd Parachute Division. By 26 November Weisweiler was taken after the Germans chose to retreat from the town. Inden fell on 30 November, bringing the industrial triangle into American hands. The 104th Division now held the western bank of the <b>Inde</b> and was ready to cross the river to push to the Rur. The crossing of the river at Lamersdorf commenced on 2 December. It was initially successful and in a swift advance the real objective, Lucherberg was taken. The division was still conducting mop-up operations, when the Germans mounted a counterattack assisted by heavy tanks against the town. The intense fighting raged only for hours and on 5 December the town was finally secured, when Collins ordered a pause due to the slow {{advance of the}} other divisions of the corps.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{geographer}} Ptolemy (150 CE) mentions {{places such}} as Badiamaioi (Badami), <b>Inde</b> (Indi), Kalligeris (Kalkeri), Modogoulla (Mudagal), Petrigala (Pattadakal), Hippokoura (Huvina Hipparagi), Nagarouris (Nagur), Tabaso (Tavasi), Tiripangalida (Gadahinglai), Soubouttou or Sabatha (Savadi), Banaouase (Banavasi), Thogorum (Tagara), Biathana (Paithan), Sirimalaga (Malkhed), Aloe(Ellapur) and Pasage (Palasige) indicating prosperous trade between Egypt, Europe and Karnataka. He also mentions Pounnata (Punnata) and refers to beryls, i.e., the Vaidhurya gems of that country. He mentions Malippala (Malpe) a coastal town of Karnataka. In this work Larika and Kandaloi are identified as Rastrika and Kuntala. Ptolemy writes {{in the midst of}} the false mouth and the Barios, there is a city called Maganur (Mangalore). He mentions of inland centres of pirates called Oloikhora (Alavakheda). He mentions Ariake Sadinon meaning Aryaka Satakarni and Baithana as capital of Siro(e) P(t)olmaios, i.e., Sri Pulimayi clearly indicating his knowledge of the Satavahana kings. The word Pulimayi means One with body of Tiger in Kannada, which bears testimony to the possible Kannada origin of Satavahana kings.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1970s, Guatemala became heavily {{invested}} on hydropower {{with the}} construction of large hydroelectric dams. The Chixoy hydroelectric project provides about 15% of the country's power. As of 2013, hydropower accounted for 47% of Guatemala's total electricity generation, with oil, diesel and biomass-fired plants accounting for the rest. The National Institute of Electricity (<b>INDE)</b> (El Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion) encouraged the private sector to build over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new hydropower in Guatemala. Additionally, <b>INDE</b> constructed the following projects: 340MW Chulac, 130MW [...] Xalala, 135-MW Serchil, 69MW Oregano, 60MW Santa Maria II, 59MW Camotan, and the 23MW El Palmar.

2500|$|In the Early Church, {{the first}} canons were decreed by bishops united in [...] "Ecumenical" [...] councils (the Emperor {{summoning}} {{all of the}} known world's bishops to attend with at least the acknowledgement of the Bishop of Rome) or [...] "local" [...] councils (bishops of a region or territory). Over time, these canons were supplemented with decretals of the Bishops of Rome, which were responses to doubts or problems according to the maxim, [...] "Roma locuta est, causa finita est" [...] ("Rome has spoken, the case is closed"). A common misconception, the Catholic Encyclopedia links this saying to St Augustine who actually said something quite different: [...] "jam enim de hac causa duo concilia missa sunt ad sedem apostolicam; <b>inde</b> etiam rescripta venerunt; causa finita est" [...] (which roughly translate to: [...] "there are two councils, for now this matter as brought to the Apostolic See, whence also letters are come to pass, the case was finished") {{in response to the}} heretical Pelagianism of the time.|$|E
2500|$|These revelations {{were not}} full, however. Though unique, they were {{proportioned}} {{on the scale}} the revealing made necessary (p.87). The reality of the Resurrection is one thing, and its appearance to something else, just as the disciples still await the full, unmediated revelation. This was the paradox and the tension of the primitive Christian experience, which created {{the nature of the}} Ekklesia, such as it was and is. [...] "The Risen One reveals in the appearances his glorified existence" [...] (p.87). Central to this is corporeality, of a kind which prohibits both spiritualizing and materializing. Künneth rejects the classic Lutheran commentator Quenstadt's definition of Christ's new body: [...] "reproductio sive reparatio of precisely the same body as was destroyed by death, ex atomis sue particulis illius corporis hinc <b>inde</b> disiectis atque dissipatis"(p.88), just as he rejects Bultmann's mythical Christ. The appearances point to a soma tes doxes (Phil. 3:21) and soma pneumatikon (I Cor. 15:42), developed by Paul.|$|E
