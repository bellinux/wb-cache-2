5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.|$|E
5|$|According to IndieWire in May 2017, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation are in {{the early}} stages of {{developing}} a reboot of Animaniacs. The interest in the reboot was <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> surge of popularity for the show when it was made available on Netflix in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as Fuller House.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

50|$|The {{major problem}} with MHD {{is that with}} current technologies, it is more expensive, and much slower, than <b>a</b> {{propeller}} <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> engine. The extra expense is from the large generator that must be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> engine. Such a large generator is not required when an engine directly drives a propeller.|$|R
5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to this dialogue, love is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2015, only 32 {{individuals}} {{had been}} recorded in western Europe, {{the majority in}} Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 232 were reported. Records were from the Czech Republic (1), Denmark (12), Estonia (8), Finland (74), Germany (10), Latvia (9), Lithuania (4), Norway (10), Poland (11), Sweden (74) and the UK (13). The UK Met Office suggested that the influx of accentors was driven by strong and persistent easterly winds from Siberia, partially <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> high-pressure area centred over Scandinavia. Another weather system produced easterlies in western Asia during the same period.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
50|$|This {{is called}} the damped {{resonance}} frequency or the damped natural frequency.

5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} slated to feature {{as part of}} the film Bean (1997), under the registration C607 EUW, in which as part of a sequence, it was driven through Harrods Department Store by Mr. Bean. Although the sequence was filmed, it {{was not included in the}} final cut. The car eventually had its debut on the big-screen when it featured in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday, with the registration YGL 572T. The film featured a second version of the same car, with exactly the same colour scheme, but with left-hand drive, <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> character befriended by Bean.|$|E

5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by}} a two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lack of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , {{with the flow}} from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
