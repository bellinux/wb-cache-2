500|$|John Scott Haldane {{identified}} {{carbon monoxide}} as the lethal constituent of afterdamp, the gas created by combustion, after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from carboxyhaemoglobin, the stable compound {{formed in the}} blood by reaction with the gas. [...] As {{a result of his}} research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The canary in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic <b>gas</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde occurs {{naturally}} and is [...] "an essential intermediate in {{cellular metabolism}} in mammals and humans." [...] At high concentrations {{it is probably}} unhealthy. Scandals have broken in both the 2005 Indonesia food scare and 2007 Vietnam food scare regarding the addition of formaldehyde to foods to extend shelf life. In 2011, after a four-year absence, Indonesian authorities found foods with formaldehyde being sold in markets {{in a number of}} regions across the country. Besides using formaldehyde, they also used borax, but not in combination. In August 2011, at least at two Carrefour supermarkets, the Central Jakarta Livestock and Fishery Sub-Department found a sweet glutinous rice drink (cendol) contained 10 parts per million of formaldehyde. In 2014, the owner of two noodle factories in Bogor, Indonesia; was arrested for using formaldehyde in noodles. 50kg of formaldehyde was confiscated. Foods known to be contaminated include noodles, salted fish, and tofu; chicken and beer are also rumored to be contaminated. In some places, such as China, formaldehyde is still used illegally as a preservative in foods, which exposes people to formaldehyde ingestion. In humans, the ingestion of formaldehyde has been shown to cause vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and in extreme cases can cause death. Testing for formaldehyde is by blood and/or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Other methods include infrared detection, <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> tubes, etc., of which HPLC is the most sensitive. In the early 1900s, it was frequently added by US milk plants to milk bottles as a method of pasteurization {{due to the lack of}} knowledge regarding formaldehyde's toxicity.|$|E
50|$|A {{challenge}} test should consist of exposing the <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> to a known concentration of gas {{to ensure that}} the <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> will respond and that the audible and visual alarms activate. It is also important inspect the <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> for any accidental or deliberate damage by checking that the housing and screws are intact to prevent any liquid ingress and that the filter is clean, all of which can affect the functionality of the <b>gas</b> <b>detector.</b> The basic calibration or {{challenge test}} kit will consist of calibration gas/regulator/calibration cap and hose (generally supplied with the <b>gas</b> <b>detector)</b> and a case for storage and transport. Because 1 in every 2,500 untested instruments will fail to respond to a dangerous concentration of gas, many large businesses use an automated test/calibration station for bump tests and calibrate their gas detectors daily.|$|E

50|$|Dräger {{was one of}} a few {{companies}} who were early pioneers of colorimetric <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> tubes (also known as detector tubes) used to measure the concentration of gases present. In a typical colorimetric <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> tube a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different.

50|$|Gas {{detectors}} can {{be classified}} according to the operation mechanism (semiconductors, oxidation, catalytic, photoionization, infrared, etc.). Gas detectors come packaged into two main form factors: portable devices and fixed <b>gas</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrochemical <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> work by {{allowing}} gases to diffuse through a porous membrane to an electrode {{where it is}} either chemically oxidized or reduced. The amount of current produced is determined by {{how much of the}} gas is oxidized at the electrode, indicating the concentration of the gas. Manufactures can customize electrochemical <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> by changing the porous barrier to allow for the detection of a certain gas concentration range. Also, since the diffusion barrier is a physical/mechanical barrier, the detector tended to be more stable and reliable over the sensor's duration and thus required less maintenance than other early detector technologies.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> is {{a device}} that detects the {{presence}} of gases in an area, often {{as part of a}} safety system. This type of equipment is used to detect a gas leak or other emissions and can interface with a control system so a process can be automatically shut down. A <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals.|$|E
5000|$|All gas {{detectors}} must be calibrated on a schedule. Of the two {{form factors}} of gas detectors, portables must be calibrated more frequently {{due to the}} regular changes in environment they experience. A typical calibration schedule for a fixed system may be quarterly, bi-annually or even annually with more robust units. A typical calibration schedule for a portable <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> is a daily [...] "bump test" [...] accompanied by a monthly calibration. Almost every portable <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> requires a specific calibration gas which {{is available from the}} manufacturer. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) may set minimum standards for periodic recalibration.|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{fast neutron}} {{detectors}} are liquid scintillators, 4-He based noble <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> [...] and plastic detectors. Fast neutron detectors differentiate themselves {{from one another}} by their 1.) capability of neutron/gamma discrimination (through pulse shape discrimination) and 2.) sensitivity. The capability to distinguish between neutrons and gammas is excellent in noble <b>gas</b> based 4-He <b>detectors</b> due to their low electron density and excellent pulse shape discrimination property.|$|R

50|$|A nondispersive {{infrared}} sensor (or NDIR sensor) {{is a simple}} spectroscopic sensor often used as a <b>gas</b> <b>detector.</b> It is nondispersive {{in the sense of}} optical dispersion since the infrared energy is allowed to pass through the atmospheric sampling chamber without deformation.|$|E
5000|$|An {{explosimeter}} is a <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> {{which is}} used to measure the amount of combustible gases present in a sample.

50|$|Ultrasonic <b>gas</b> <b>detectors</b> use {{acoustic}} {{sensors to}} detect {{changes in the}} background noise of its environment. Since most high-pressure gas leaks generate sound in the ultrasonic range of 25 kHz to 10 MHz, the sensors are able to easily distinguish these frequencies from background acoustic noise which occurs in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The ultrasonic <b>gas</b> leak <b>detector</b> then produces an alarm {{when there is an}} ultrasonic deviation from the normal condition of background noise. Ultrasonic <b>gas</b> leak <b>detectors</b> cannot measure <b>gas</b> concentration, but the device is able to determine the leak rate of an escaping gas because the ultrasonic sound level depends on the gas pressure and size of the leak.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The energy {{spectra of}} X-rays with {{energies}} below 2 keV measured at atmospheric pressure with standard Xe <b>gas</b> <b>detectors,</b> such as <b>gas</b> proportional-scintillation counters, exhibit distortions {{that are related}} to losses of electrons and fluorescence photons to the radiation window. In this paper, a Monte Carlo simulation method that takes into account these losses investigates the use of Xe–Ne mixtures as detection media in this energy range. For a total pressure of 1 atm, energy spectra were calculated for nine mixtures with Xe concentrations varying from 10 % to 100 %. The results have shown that the addition of Ne to Xe significantly reduces distortion and improves the energy resolution of the full energy peaks.
