The entire industry as a whole, although not as concentrated as the electrometallurgical <b>ferroalloy</b> manufacturing sector, employs 34,000 paid workers at 234 individual workplaces. Ohio's 234 workplaces make up 9.5% of the United States industry's workplaces, and the 34,000 paid workers make up 13.6% of the United States industry's workers.

40|$|<b>Ferroalloys</b> are {{integral}} part of steel melting process. The purpose of using <b>ferroalloys</b> is three fold e. g. killing of steel, modifying the slag composition and steel alloying. Amount of <b>ferroalloys</b> used for alloying is subject to requirements of steel properties e. g. yield strength, ductility, formability etc. Variety of <b>ferroalloys</b> (some-times pure metal) is used by steel industries depending upon their techno-economic feasibility. Size, chemistry and modes of addition of <b>ferroalloys</b> are suitably engineered to bring in operational consistency and cost ben-efits. Of late, Tata Steel has tried out a few <b>ferroalloys</b> {{for the first time}} with interesting results to meet the specific requirements of high strength interstitial free (IF) and micro-alloyed steels. Some of these <b>ferroalloys</b> have been put into regular use with complete or partial replacement of <b>ferroalloys</b> used earlier. Size of one of the <b>ferroalloys</b> has also been modified without any other adverse effects. This paper summarizes requirements of <b>ferroalloys</b> for the steel industry with special emphasis on recent trials. 1...|$|R

40|$|Basic <b>ferroalloys</b> {{are some}} of the most {{important}} ingredients for producing carbon and special steel (using ferrochrome and other special <b>ferroalloys).</b> The market of basic <b>ferroalloys</b> is somehow independent of other raw materials markets, depending mostly of steel. There are sometimes speculative operations, but they do not have a significant impact on prices. Producers are concentrated in countries and regions where metals (manganese, silicium or silicon, chromium) deposits can be found: mostly Africa, China and Latin America. On the other side, consumption is concentrated in Europe and the USA, recently also within the BRIC countries. This situation generates conflicts, especially about prices and long term contracts. The spot market is quite volatile and dominated by traders. The atypical crisis which began at the end of 2007 had not a significant impact on basic <b>ferroalloys</b> prices until 2012. By contrast, 2013 was a very difficult year for <b>ferroalloys,</b> with small prices and a precarious economic situation worldwide...|$|R
