25|$|<b>First</b> <b>dates</b> are {{designed}} to produce a number of relationship outcomes. (e.g., sexual partner, friendship, short-term romantic relationship, or life partnership.)

The three most common goals that people have on <b>first</b> <b>dates</b> are to reduce uncertainty, achieve relational escalation, and to have fun.|$|R
