It transmits torque through three different shafts. This project deals with the design and optimization of the differential gear box through use of composite material. The solid modelling is done by using SOLIDWORKS. Static analysis is performed on the gear using Ni-CR steel, malleable cast iron, aluminium alloy and glass filled polyamide using ANSYS 14. 5 The results are tabulated for Von- Misesstress, strain and deformation and compared against the composite material. The composite differential gear box is compared against the other currently used materials and the reults are concluded accordingly...|$|E

40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of national economy, big gear was widely applied in metallurgy and mine domains. So, big <b>gear</b> <b>plays</b> {{an important role}} in above domains. In practical production, big gear abrasion and breach take place often. It affects normal production and causes unnecessary economic loss. A kind of intelligent test method was put forward on worn big gear mainly aimed at the big gear restriction conditions of high production cost, long production cycle and high- intensity artificial repair welding work. The measure equations transformations were made on involute straight gear. Original polar coordinate equations were transformed into rectangular coordinate equations. Big gear abrasion measure principle was introduced. Detection principle diagram was given. Detection route realization method was introduced. OADM 12 laser sensor was selected. Detection on big gear abrasion area was realized by detection mechanism. Tested data of unworn gear and worn gear were led in designed calculation program written by Visual Basic language. Big gear abrasion quantity can be obtained. It provides a feasible method for intelligent test and intelligent repair welding on worn big gear. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{prevalence}} of osteomyelitis, the prevalence of soft tissue infections, and the type and number of pathogens encountered in bone and soft tissue infections caused by puncture wounds in children. In addition, we seek to establish whether shoe <b>gear</b> <b>plays</b> {{a role in the}} flora in infected puncture wounds and if laboratory indices are indicative of the presence of infection. The group consisted of 44 nondiabetic children admitted to hospital for puncture wounds of the foot. Cultures were positive for osteomyelitis in 7 patients (16 %), all involving the forefoot (P <. 04). The most common pathogen in soft tissue infections was Staphylococcus aureus. The most common pathogen in osteomyelitis was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection based on footwear. There were no cases of osteomyelitis encountered among barefoot children (P <. 04). In 10 cases (83 %), P aeruginosa infection (both soft tissue and bone) occurred while the patients were wearing tennis shoes (P <. 04). In this study, the leukocyte count (normal in 29 patients [66 %]), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (normal in 28 patients [64 %]), and temperature (normal in 44 patients [95 %]) did not have any predictive value in differentiating soft tissue infection from osteomyelitis in children. ...|$|E
40|$|The North pacific {{fur seals}} of Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s Pribilof Islands have been {{subjected}} to commercial harvest for nearly 200 years. The harvest has been regulated under international agreement almost continuously since 1911; first under the 1911 North Pacific Fur Seal Convention, and following that under the 1957 Interim Convention on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals. Both Conventions banned pelagic sealing and divided the restricted land harvest among the four member states, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Management under the 1911 convention resulted in a steady increase in the severely depleted fur seal herd, restoring the population to pre-exploitation levels. The 1957 Convention was less successful in achieving its stated population goal, and expired in 1984 when the u. S. voted against re-ratification. The Pribilof fur seal population, now protected under the Marine mammal Protection Act, has been declining steadily since 1974. While evidence indicates that entanglement in discarded fishing <b>gear</b> <b>plays</b> {{a major role in the}} decline, research into this and other factors affecting fur seal population dynamics is necessary. International cooperation and regulation of disposal of fishing gear at sea may be required in order to effectively protect the northern fur seal herd...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is very}} {{important}} to know the dynamic behavior of differential gears, In the present paper, the dynamic behavior of differential gears were investigated by measuring the torque variations of one drive and two driven shafts under conditions where one driven shaft was rotated at a fixed speed, and the other at a variable speed by varying the speed of the drive shaft. Furtheremore, under conditions where hypoid gear was assembled with complete tooth bearing, heel tooth bearing, or hard heel tooth bearing, the dynamic behavior of differential gears was investigated by measuring the tooth root stresses of hypoid gear was and the torque variations of each shaft. In comparison with these measured data, the effect of tooth bearing on the dynamic behavior of differential gears became clear...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{investigation}} of helical planetary <b>gears</b> <b>plays</b> {{an important role}} in structure design as the vibration and noise are perceived negatively to the transmission quality. With consideration of the axial deformations of members, the gyroscopic effects, the time-variant meshing stiffness, and the coupling amongst stages, a three-dimensional dynamic model of the two-stage helical planetary gears is established by using of the lumped-parameter method in this paper. The model is applicable to variant number of planets in two stages, different planet phasing, and spacing configurations. Numerical simulation is conducted to detect the structured vibration modes of the equally spaced systems. Furthermore, the unique properties of these vibration modes are mathematically proved. Results show that the vibration modes of the two-stage helical planetary gears can be categorized as five classes: the rigid body mode, the axial translational-rotational mode, the radical translational mode, and the 1 st-stage and the 2 nd-stage planet mode...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} variations of landings of two key species, Sardinella aurita and Sardinella maderensis, in Senegalese waters over a ten-year period (2004 - 2013). Using generalized additive models, {{it was found}} that fishing <b>gear</b> <b>played</b> a major role in explaining differences in monthly landings for both species (51 - 71 % deviance explained). Its effect was more significant {{in the southern part of}} Senegal. Fishing effort (number of trips) accounted only for 4 - 18 % of variability in landings. Purse seine (PS) fishing was the most important contributor to the landings of both species. In addition, in the southern area, surrounding gillnet fishing was also important for S. maderensis. Modeling results showed that the relationship between monthly effort and landings was generally positive and leveling off, while it was dome shaped for PSs and surrounding gillnets. Thus, when estimating fishing effort indices for management in Senegal, it is necessary to account for differences in fishing gears and the non-linear relationship between fishing effort and landings...|$|R
