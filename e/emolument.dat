5|$|On January 5, 1993, , a bill {{to reduce}} the salary of the Treasury Secretary from $148,400 to $99,500 (the pre-1989 level), passed by a voice vote in the Senate and by the House on January 6. On January 19, President George H.W. Bush signed a bill {{enacting}} a temporary Saxbe fix so that Senator Lloyd Bentsen could move from the Senate {{to take the job}} of Treasury Secretary during the newly elected Clinton administration. S.J. RES. 1 (1993), which canceled <b>emolument</b> increases for the remainder of Bentsen's term, a term set to expire at noon on January 3, 1995, had been passed by both Houses without objection. However, in a law review article, University of Minnesota Law School Professor Michael Stokes Paulson rejected the Bentsen fix as unconstitutional. In 1994, President Bill Clinton received approval to use a Saxbe fix to appoint United States Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to the Supreme Court, but Mitchell withdrew his name from consideration for reasons unrelated to his eligibility.|$|E

It is the conviction of the Department of the Air Force that this recognition was and is appropriate. Moreover, appointments to this grade during periods other than war would carry the unavoidable connotation of downgrading of those officers so honored in World War II.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take {{newly created}} or higher-paying {{political}} positions; rather, they must {{wait until the}} conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the Saxbe fix). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator Hugo Black was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's <b>emolument</b> had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.|$|E

2500|$|In {{those days}} the Hindu {{community}} had got alarmed owing to several conversions to Christianity which {{were taking place}} among the boys at missionary schools offering free education. To counter this, there was an anti-missionary movement led by the rich and influential baboos of Calcutta to have a free national school of their own. One afternoon they all assembled in a meeting presided over by Raja Radha Kanta Deb at the premises of the Oriental Seminary. Many were the speeches made and resolutions adopted. But {{when it was time}} for making subscriptions, down came the spirit of the baboos from boiling point to near freezing mark. The subscription book passed from one hand to another, all being indecisive so as to putting down the amount suiting their respective purses, prestige and object. When the book passed to the hand of Mutty Lall Seal, he immediately put down his name for a lac of rupees. Astounded and dumb founded by his munificence, all others who had estimated contributing a few hundred or a few thousand rupees panicked to close the proceedings and the meeting broke up in a fiasco. However pledged to his subscription Mutty Lall Seal carried out the promise of a national institution with his own independent efforts. On Wednesday, 1 March 1842, a gathering of respectable people took place at his house for the formal opening of the Mutty Lall Seal's Free College. Among those present were Sir Lawrence Peel, the Chief Justice; Sir John Peter Grant; Mr. Lyall, the Advocate-General; Mr. Leith and the other principal members of the Calcutta Bar; Captain Birch, Superintendent of the Police; Mr. George Thompson, Right Reverend Dr. Carew; Baboo Dwarkanath Tagore; Baboo Ramcomul Sen; Baboo Russomoy Dutt and Revd. Krishna Mohan Banerjee. The Catholic Bishop and all the clergy of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as all the Professors of St. Xavier's College, were likewise present. Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended. There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as [...] "a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honourable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind". [...] Mutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed as Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of the Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and <b>emolument</b> in their own country. The course of education included English Literature, History, Geography, Elocution, Writing, Arithmetic, Algebra, Philosophical Sciences, Higher Mathematics & practical application of Mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, only one rupee was charged per month to cover the expenses of books, stationery etc. and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time, to be limited to five hundred. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of St. F. Xavier, Chowringhee, Calcutta who undertook to furnish teachers to further the cause of secular education. Although Jesuits were entrusted with the responsibility of imparting education, the conductors had pledged themselves to withhold all Christian instruction from the pupils. However, later Mutty Lall Seal dissolved the connection between his college and the Jesuits over a dispute that in violation of their pledge, viands were distributed among the Hindu boys contrary to their religious sentiments. The institute was then placed under Revd. Krishna Mohan Banerjee. A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the University examinations (Suniti Kumar Chatterji and Swami Prabhupada were some illustrious students of this college). The college initially started functioning at Mutty Lall Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on Chittaranjan Avenue where it still exists.|$|E
