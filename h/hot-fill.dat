50|$|Racemic {{and regular}} PLLA {{has a low}} glass {{transition}} temperature, which is undesirable. A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures, lending it more mechanical strength. It has {{a wide range of}} applications, such as woven shirts (ironability), microwavable trays, <b>hot-fill</b> applications and even engineering plastics (in this case, the stereocomplex is blended with a rubber-like polymer such as ABS). Such blends also have good form stability and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra, a long-lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for lipoatrophy of cheeks. Progress in biotechnology has resulted in the development of commercial production of the D enantiomer form, something that was not possible until recently.|$|E
5000|$|Aseptic {{processing}} is {{the process}} by which a sterile (aseptic) product (typically food or pharmaceutical) is packaged in a sterile container in a way that maintains sterility. Sterility is achieved with a flash-heating process (temperature between 195 and 295 °F (91 to 146 °C)), which retains more nutrients and uses less energy than conventional sterilization techniques such as retort or <b>hot-fill</b> canning. Pharmaceutical Sterile processing includes use of clean rooms, bacteria retaining filters, dry or steam heat. Aseptic food preservation methods allow processed food to keep {{for long periods of time}} without preservatives, as long as they are not opened. The aseptic packages are typically a mix of paper (70%), polyethylene (LDPE) (24%), and aluminum (6%), with a tight polyethylene inside layer. Sterile pharmaceuticals are usually packaged in plastic or glass. Together these materials form a tight seal against microbiological organisms, contaminants, and degradation, eliminating the need for refrigeration.|$|E
40|$|Critical {{steps of}} a typical {{industrial}} line for processing a blackberry-based beverage in glass bottles have been studied, together {{with the effects of}} storage of final product at four different temperatures. For the steps, contents of total phenolics, anthocyanins, ellagitannins, andminor phenolic compounds were assessed byHPLC-DAD and antioxidant capacity by H-ORAC and DPPH. Thermal processes, especially blanching, drastically reduced anthocyanins,whereas <b>hot-filling</b> degraded ellagitannins. The final product showed reduced values for the anthocyanins cyanidin- 3 - glucoside (by 52 %) and cyanidin- 3 -malonyl glucoside (64 %), and ellagitannins lambertianin C (80 %), and sanguiin H- 6 (50 %). Antioxidant capacity (H-ORAC) dropped by almost 47 %. The anthocyanins and ellagitannins continued degrading during storage, especially if temperatures were high. Reduction kinetic parameters during storage were estimated for anthocyanins and, for the first time, for both lambertianin C and sanguiin H- 6. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris spores were {{recently}} proposed {{to be used}} as design criterion for thermal processes of acid fruit products. This microorganism has been found in commercial pasteurized acid fruit juices, such as orange and apple. Although being non-pathogenic and not easy to detect visually, it is responsible for off-flavours development. On the other hand, the first thermal inactivation kinetic studies confirmed that these spores are much more resistant than the usual spoilage microorganisms in acid foods. Therefore, in 2000 it was firstly proposed {{to be used in the}} design of <b>hot-filling</b> and continuous pasteurization conditions of a tropical fruit pulp and juice, respectively. This work presents a critical review on inactivation kinetics of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris spores. The available studies were obtained under thermal treatments, and studied the effects of temperature, pH and soluble solids. Those effects were quantified in terms of decimal reduction time (first order model) and z-values (Bigelow model). Furthermore, they were obtained under isothermal conditions. Future challenges in this field are to quantify the inactivation kinetics behaviour under dynamic conditions, using thermal and non-thermal treatments, such as ozonation, ultrasonication or high pressure. These alternative treatments have the advantage of minimizing quality attributes degradation and improving products. Moreover, predictive microbiology skills are suggested as a valuable tool for process design and optimization...|$|R
40|$|Cupuacüu (Theobroma grandiflorum) is an Amazonian {{tropical}} fruit {{with a great}} economic potential. Pasteurization, by a <b>hot-filling</b> technique, was suggested {{for the preservation of}} this fruit pulp at room temperature. The process was implemented with local communities in Brazil. The process was modeled, and a computer program was written in Turbo Pascal. The relative importance among the pasteurization process variables (initial product temperature, heating rate, holding temperature and time, container volume and shape, cooling medium type and temperature) on the microbial target and quality was investigated, by performing simulations according to a screening factorial design. Afterward, simulations of the different processing conditions were carried out. The holding temperature (TF) and time (thold) affected pasteurization value (P), and the container volume (V) influenced largely the quality parameters. The process was optimized for retail (1 L) and industrial (100 L) size containers, by maximizing volume average quality in terms of color lightness and sensory “fresh notes” and minimizing volume average total color difference and sensory “cooked notes”. Equivalent processes were designed and simulated (P 91 °C) 4. 6 min on Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris spores) and final quality (color, flavor, and aroma attributes) was evaluated. Color was slightly affected by the pasteurization processes, and few differences were observed between the six equivalent treatments designed (TF between 80 and 97 °C). TF g 91 °C minimized “cooked notes ” and maximized “fresh notes ” of cupuacüu pulp aroma and flavor for 1 L container. Concerning the 100 L size, the “cooked notes ” development can be minimized with TF g 91 °C, but overall the quality was greatly degraded {{as a result of the}} long cooling times. A more efficient method to speed up the cooling phase was recommended, especially for the industrial size of containers...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} possibilities and limitations of the <b>hot-fill</b> principle applied in washing machines and dish washing equipment. The study started with literature research, showing the washing performance of <b>hot-fill</b> washing machines to be generally poorer than the performance of cold-fill equipment. Moreover, washing machines specifically adapted to <b>hot-fill</b> have longer pay-back periods. For <b>hot-fill</b> dish washers no unequivocal measuring results relating to energy consumption and dish washing performance were available. That's why the study further focused on dish washers. A number of energy consumption measurements and washing performance tests at various operating modes have shown the greatest energy cost cuts to be attained in filling a standard dish washer with hot water. The washing and drying performance is not affected by <b>hot-fill.</b> From supplementary measurements it appeared that storage-type water heaters are most suitable for this application. With this type of appliance energy consumption is lowest. Dimensioning of the hot water piping is important. Only if the sizing is kept to a minimum, will there be any saving of primary energy, when running the 65 degrees C standard program.

40|$|Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) {{has become}} the {{preferred}} material of choice for many packaging applications. A preference over glass due to its low weight, similar transparency to glass and cost consideration, including the availability of recycled PET feedstock via kerbside collection has provided newer opportunities for <b>hot-fill</b> applications. Ostensibly, this material is used for beverage markets requiring cold and hot filling (85 oC) of liquid foods. However due to the poor thermal stability of PET - due to its low glass transition temperature - an increase in elevated temperatures limits the number of market segments the material can be utilised. Current practices incorporate the heat-set process, aimed at improving the crystallisation kinetics within the amorphous and crystalline region. This body of work incorporates a single stage Injection Stretch Blow Moulding machine (ISBM). Modifications to conventional carbonated soft drink (CSD) beverage containers to include heat-set capabilities are incorporated. The current research study investigates {{the potential benefits of}} RPET blends for improving thermal stability at elevated temperatures. This study investigates changes in mechanical properties which include: • Youngs modulus, • top load strength, • burst strength, • Thermal analysis specifically investigating changes in • Glass transition temperature, • enthalpy changes due to heat-set conditions • Percentage crystallinity changes as a function of heat-set conditions Rheological characteristics to all materials used were investigates. Furthermore, changes in the physical properties to each PET beverage container were investigated which include; • process shrinkage (S 1), • <b>hot-fill</b> shrinkage (S 2) • Density changes via optimised DoE parameters.

40|$|Dr. Olga Padilla-Zakour, Dr. Edward McLaughlinTart cherries, Concord grapes, {{and apples}} {{are known for}} their health {{benefits}} due to high phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Apples are also a rich source of fiber, helping {{to reduce the risk of}} some types of cancer. However, current juice processing leads to significant losses of these compounds through degradation heating and poor extraction from fruit. Pomace, a byproduct of pressing, is a rich source of total phenols, antioxidants, and dietary fiber. Therefore, alternative processing approaches which promote the preservation of these compounds are essential. Our objective was to develop pulpy juices from tart cherries, Concord grapes, and apples with maximum retention of fruit components and to evaluate storage quality of pulpy juices against clear juices. The following fruits were used in this study: Concord grape; tart cherry cv. Balaton and Montmorency; three varieties of red apple: Cortland, Empire, and McIntosh; and one variety of yellow apple: Golden Delicious. Fruits were harvested from the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station Orchards, Geneva, NY during the 2007 harvesting season. Juices were processed as clarified/clear (depectinased) and pulpy. A turbo extractor with two screen sizes, and a high shear mixer, were employed in pulpy tart cherry and Concord grape juice processing. A turbo extractor was used with or without a blanching and/or enzymatic treatment in pulpy apples juice processing. Juices were pasteurized by <b>hot-filling</b> at 85 ?C in 10 -oz glass bottles. Whole fruit and juices were analyzed for pH, acidity, soluble solids, and dry and pectin content. Juice viscosity was also measured. Shelf-life studies at 18 ?C were conducted at 0, 12, and 24 weeks to determine changes over time in color, percent settled solids, turbidity, total phenolics content, antioxidant capacity, anthocyanin content and polymeric color (only in tart cherry and Concord grape). Total phenolic and anthocyanin content, antioxidant capacity, and percent polymeric color in whole fruits were also measured in extracts prepared by methanol extraction of freeze-dried powdered fruit. Sensory evaluations were conducted at 0 and 24 weeks to determine an acceptance of color, flavor, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability using a 7 -point hedonic scale. The ranking test was used for flavor intensity and preference. Pulpy juices had higher phenolic and anthocyanin content, and antioxidant capacity than clear juices of the same fruit type; the content was comparable to that of whole fruits. These compounds in pulpy juices were 73 to 87 % of whole tart cherry, 95 to 100 % of whole Concord grapes, and 60 to 100 % of whole apples. The percent loss over time of these compounds was similar in clear and pulpy juices from tart cherry and Concord grapes; however, the content in pulpy tart cherry juices was 13 to 41 % higher than that of clear juices, and 50 to 134 % higher in Concord grape juices. Even though the percent loss of total phenols and antioxidant capacity over 24 weeks in clear apple juices was lower (0 to 11 %) than that of pulpy juices (6 to 22 %), pulpy juices had 1. 7 to 3. 6 times higher total amounts of these compounds than clear juices. Dry content of pulpy juices were 0. 3 to 11. 8 % higher than clear juices. Pectin content of pulpy juices was comparable to that of whole fruits. There was almost no pectin in clear juices. Pulpy juices represented a rich source of soluble fiber and one serving contained 0. 7 to 11. 6 g pectin. Sensory evaluation confirmed that overall acceptability and preference of pulpy juices were as equally acceptable as clear juices at 0 weeks storage but was lower at 24 weeks. However, pulpy juices were rated positively in all attributes and thus were acceptable from a consumer view point. Pulpy juices could be a healthy shelf-stable fruit juice product if the processing is optimized. Fulbright Foundation, Department of Food Science and Technology (Cornell University...|$|R

However, {{only some of the}} adequate conditions offer final products with maximum quality. Several simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of filling temperature, container shape, type of cooling medium and pasteurization value on final quality retention expressed as vitamin C retention. Using statistical factorial analysis the most important parameters affecting quality were filling temperature and pasteurization value, followed by cooling medium.

Thermal imaging technology was used to record temperatures of the patching material throughout the entire exercise, from the stage of material collection, through transportation to repair site, patch forming, and compaction. Practical complications occurring during patch repairs were also identified. It was found that depending on the weather conditions, duration of the travel and poor insulation of the transported hot asphalt mix, its temperature can drop as high as 116. 6  °C over the period that the reinstatement team travel to the site and prepare the patch. This impacting is on the durability and performance of the executed repairs. Cold spots on the asphalt mat and temperature differentials between the new <b>hot-fill</b> asphalt mix and existing pavement were also identified as poorly compacted areas that were prone to premature failure.

The so-called Flake To Resin (FTRÒ) recycling process produces PET pellets or preforms from conventionally recycled PET flakes for the application in new PET packaging in direct food contact. The investigated process can be considered as "super-clean" recycling process and was developed to introduce conventional recycled post-consumer (PCR) PET flakes up to an amount of 50 % into the pellet and preform production. Within the study, the cleaning efficiency of the investigated FTRÒ process was determined by a challenge test. The experimental results obtained from three challenge tests with different input concentrations of the surrogates and different amounts of post-consumer PET flakes show that all applied surrogates are very efficiently removed by the investigated recycling process. The cleaning efficiencies for all surrogates are above 99. 9 %. In the final product of the process no surrogates could be determined above the detection limits even if the initial concentrations were in the percentage range. From a migrational point the final product of the challenge test was similar to virgin PET except the PET typical substances acetaldehyde and ethylene glycol, which had slightly higher concentrations.

The biplot of PLS 2 with all the samples and vari-ables explained 89 % of the X variables (instrumental measurements) and 58 % of the Y variables (sensory attributes). Sensory firmness was mostly explained by the instrumental firmness measurements such as the area under the curve for the Kramer and back extrusion tests.

40|$|Heat {{processing}} is {{the most}} commonly used treatment for microbial inactivation. However, temperature may have adverse effects on sensory and nutritional attributes of foods. Non-thermal technologies have received increasing attention for preservation of beverages, due to their potential for inactivating spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, they can help minimizing quality losses, namely flavour, colour and nutritional value. Ultraviolet-C radiation (UV-C) is widely used as an alternative strategy to control microorganism in food products. Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a thermo-acidophilic, non-pathogenic and spore-forming bacterium, able to grow at low pH (3. 0 – 3. 5) and high temperatures (50 – 70 °C). It has been considered a new type of spoilage bacterium, with important potential spoilage concern for <b>hot-fill</b> fruit and fruit juices. The main objective of this work was to study the influence of UV-C radiation treatments with seven different intensities (0. 32, 0. 86, 2. 59, 5. 59, 8. 45, 11. 50 and 13. 44 W/m 2) on A. acidoterrestris inactivation in apple juices. Commercial juices were artificially inoculated with bacterium, with initial loads around 107 CFU/mL. They were then exposed to UV-C radiation and the treatment impact on microbial loads was assessed throughout exposure times. Results showed that the log-survival of A. acidoterrestris decreased linearly with treatment time, for all intensities tested. A decimal reduction time at a given UV-C intensity was estimated by fitting a first order kinetic model to experimental data. When the most severe intensity was used (i. e., 13. 44 W/m 2), the number of spores decreased drastically (around 5 -log reduction, which attains US Food and Drug Administration requirements) after 8 min of treatment. For the remaining UV-C intensities, this inactivation was achieved for higher exposure times. Overall it can be concluded that UV-C radiation is a promising treatment with a drastic impact on the loads of A. acidoterrestris in apple juices, especially when high intensities are used...|$|E
40|$|Interest in the {{chemistry}} {{and stability of}} flavonoids in foods has been generated by countless epidemiological, in vitro, and in vivo studies that suggest a variety of potential health promoting effects of diets rich in flavonoids. Flavonoids {{have been shown to}} interact with multiple components in beverages including macromolecules, minerals, certain vitamins, and other flavonoids. Furthermore, environmental conditions including light exposure, elevated temperatures, and relative humidity have been shown to modify flavonoid stability. However, specific mechanisms, relative kinetics of degradation reactions and the impact of macromolecules in model beverages and biological fluids on flavonoid stability remain largely unknown. Recently, interest in the application of natural pigments to replace synthetic dyes in beverages has grown. However, there is limited information concerning the impact of prominent beverage ingredients, photo and thermal stress, and the potential mechanisms involved in anthocyanin degradation. Chapter 2 of this dissertation investigates the stability of anthocyanin rich grape and purple sweet potato (PSP) extracts to photo and thermal stresses in ready-to-drink beverage models including <b>hot-fill</b> beverages with varying concentrations of ascorbic acid, a preserved beverage, and a vitamin enriched water beverage. Thermal and photo stress were induced at 40, 60, and 80 oC and 250, 500, and 750 W/m 2, respectively. Increasing concentration of ascorbic acid resulted in more rapid degradation of anthocyanins through thermal stress, but had a protective effect through photo stress. Additionally, PSP was significantly less stable than grape extract in the vitamin enriched water model beverage through photo stress. Furthermore, a potential degradation mechanism involving the formation of monoacylated peonidins from diacylated peonidins under photo, but not thermal, stress was identified. The transfer of dietary flavonoids to human milk and the potential exposure to nursing infants quickly became of interest. Chapters 3 and 4 of this dissertation focuses on the presence of several flavonoids in human milk samples. In our initial screening, samples were collected from 17 women who delivered healthy term babies (37 wk of gestation) at 1, 4, and 13 -wk postpartum intervals. Epicatechin (63. 7 - 828. 5 nmol/L), epicatechin gallate (55. 7 - 645. 6 nmol/L), epigallocatechin gallate (215. 1 - 2364. 7 nmol/L), naringenin (64. 1 - 722. 0 nmol/L), kaempferol (7. 8 - 71. 4 nmol/L),hesperetin (74. 8 - 1603. 1 nmol/L), and quercetin (32. 5 - 108. 6 nmol/L) were present in human milk samples with high inter/intraindividual variability. With the exception of kaempferol, the mean flavonoid content in human milk was not statistically different among lactation stages. In contrast, carotenoids in human milk significantly decreased from weeks 1 to 13 of lactation. In our follow up study, cohorts from the USA, China, and Mexico each comprised of 20 women in each country. Milk samples were collected at 2, 4, 13, and 26 -wk postpartum intervals. Glucuronides of epicatechin, naringenin, kaempferol, hesperetin, and quercetin were the predominant metabolites detected. Despite all efforts, anthocyanins were not detected in any of the 4 cohorts between the 2 studies and their relatively low bioavailability and presence in tissue is likely a contributing factor. The presence of flavonoids in human milk suggested that select flavonoids maintained relative stability in protein rich fluid in order to avoid degradation between emptying through feeding. Previous studies indicated that polyphenols bind to proline rich segments, including those on caseins, and may have a stabilization effect. Chapter 5 investigates the impact of protein rich milk on tea flavan- 3 -ol degradation during thermal treatment. Single strength milk (36. 2 protein per L), quarter strength milk (9. 0 g protein per L), and a zero protein control models were incubated with isolated epigallocatechin gallate and green tea extract at 62 or 37 oC for 180 minutes. Intact flavan- 3 -ols as well as auto-oxidation products including theasinesins (THSNs) and P- 2 dimer concentrations were quantified by LC-MS. In general, greater polyphenol to protein ratios increased first order degradation rates, which consequently decreased the formation of THSNs and P- 2 dimers. The presence of the galloyl and hydroxy moieties increased apparent affinity of flavan- 3 -ols to proteins, thereby stabilizing monomeric flavan- 3 -ols to processing conditions with increasing protein concentrations. In contrast, the absence of these moieties led to no observable interactions to proteins. A thorough understanding of protein-polyphenol interactions may provide further insight to their chemistry in protein rich beverages and biological fluid...|$|E
