25|$|Related to reuse: If a <b>deliverable</b> is {{reusable}} {{in multiple}} situations {{and another that}} is related to it is not, than {{it would make sense}} to produce the reusable <b>deliverable</b> first, because of its wider uses.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>deliverable</b> {{commodity}} {{is not in}} plentiful supply (or when it {{does not}} yet exist) rational pricing cannot be applied, as the arbitrage mechanism is not applicable. Here {{the price of the}} futures is determined by today's supply and demand for the underlying asset in the future.|$|E

50|$|With timeboxing, the {{deadline}} is fixed, but the scope may be reduced. This focuses {{work on the}} most important <b>deliverables.</b> For this reason, timeboxing depends on the prioritisation (with the MoSCoW method for example) of <b>deliverables,</b> to ensure that it is the project stakeholders who determine the important <b>deliverables</b> rather than software developers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Software {{developers}} are usually familiar with software engineering <b>deliverables</b> but face difficulties in providing the <b>deliverables</b> {{that must be}} {{in line with the}} Common Criteria requirement. The software engineering <b>deliverables</b> lack the security requirements to be the evidences in the Common Criteria evaluation and certification. Therefore, the main aim is to develop a framework betwee...|$|R
25|$|When the <b>deliverable</b> asset {{exists in}} {{plentiful}} supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the <b>deliverable</b> commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{base for}} the statue, however, was first <b>deliverable</b> in 1770, and the {{unveiling}} of the equestrian statue finally {{took place in the}} courtyard at Amalienborg Palace on 1 August 1771, five years after the King’s death in 1766. It commands the site still to this day, and has been restored 1997-1998.|$|E
25|$|The {{expectation}} based relationship {{will also}} hold in a no-arbitrage setting {{when we take}} expectations {{with respect to the}} risk-neutral probability. In other words: a futures price is a martingale with respect to the risk-neutral probability. With this pricing rule, a speculator is expected to break even when the futures market fairly prices the <b>deliverable</b> commodity.|$|E
40|$|Within the STELLAR project, {{we provide}} the {{possibility}} to use living documents for the collaborative writing work on <b>deliverables.</b> Compared to 'normal' <b>deliverables,</b> 'living' <b>deliverables</b> come into existence much earlier than their delivery deadline {{and are expected to}} 'live on' after their official delivery to the European Commission. They are expected to foster collaboration. Within this contribution we investigate, how these <b>deliverables</b> have been used over the first 16 months of the project. We therefore propose a set of new analysis methods facilitating social network analysis on publicly available revision history data. With this instrumentarium, we critically look at whether the living <b>deliverables</b> have been successfully used for collaboration and whether their 'afterlife' beyond the contractual deadline had turned them into 'zombies' (still visible, but no or little live editing activities). The results show that the observed <b>deliverables</b> show signs of life, but often in connection with a topical change and in conjunction with changes in the pattern of collaboration...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Between fiscal years 2010 and 2012, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) border and maritime research and development (R&D) components reported producing 97 R&D <b>deliverables</b> at an estimated cost of $ 177 million. The type of border and maritime R&D <b>deliverables</b> produced by DHS's Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, the Coast Guard, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) varied, and R&D customers we met with reported mixed views {{on the impact of}} the R&D <b>deliverables</b> they received. These <b>deliverables</b> were wide-ranging in their cost and scale, and included knowledge products and reports, technology prototypes, and software (as shown in the figure below). The Coast Guard and DNDO reported having processes in place to collect and evaluate feedback from its customers regarding the results of R&D <b>deliverables.</b> However, S&T has not established timeframes and milestones for collecting and evaluating feedback from its customers {{on the extent to which}} the <b>deliverables</b> it provides to DHS components [...] such as US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) [...] are meeting its customer's needs. Doing so could help S&T better determine the usefulness and impact of its R&D projects and <b>deliverables</b> and make better-informed decisions regarding future work...|$|R
25|$|By contrast, in {{a shallow}} and {{illiquid}} market, or in a market in which large quantities of the <b>deliverable</b> asset have been deliberately withheld from market participants (an illegal action known as cornering the market), the market clearing price for the futures may still represent the balance between supply and demand but the relationship between this price and the expected future price of the asset can break down.|$|E
25|$|Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt {{attempted}} to corner the world silver {{markets in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to {{more than half of}} the world's <b>deliverable</b> silver. During the Hunts' accumulation of the precious metal, silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later, much of the fall occurring on a single day now known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.|$|E
25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the <b>deliverable</b> “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can {{get a feel for the}} use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} for {{measuring}} functional size is function point analysis. Function point analysis measures {{the size of}} the software <b>deliverable</b> from a user's perspective. Function point sizing is done based on user requirements and provides an accurate representation of both size for the developer/estimator and value (functionality to be delivered) and reflects the business functionality being delivered to the customer. The method includes the identification and weighting of user recognizable inputs, outputs and data stores. The size value is then available for use in conjunction with numerous measures to quantify and to evaluate software delivery and performance (development cost per function point; delivered defects per function point; function points per staff month.).|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of the Interior had {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} reports into the availability of certain building materials, {{with the result that}} stones long not seen in Vienna were used, such as Wöllersdorfer Stein, for plinths and free-standing, simply-divided buttresses, the famously hard stone from Kaisersteinbruch, whose colour was more appropriate than that of Kelheimerstein, for more lushly decorated parts. The somewhat coarser-grained Kelheimerstein (also known as Solnhof Plattenstein) was intended as the main stone {{to be used in the}} building of the opera house, but the necessary quantity was not <b>deliverable.</b> Breitenbrunner stone was suggested as a substitute for the Kelheimer stone, and stone from Jois was used as a cheaper alternative to the Kaiserstein. The staircases were constructed from polished Kaiserstein, while most of the rest of the interior was decorated with varieties of marble.|$|E
25|$|Within the adopted Unitary Development Plan, {{sites around}} Black Patch Park, {{near to the}} Soho Foundry were {{allocated}} for industrial uses {{in order to attract}} investment for a Technology Park. However, this has not come to fruition. A recent Employment Land Survey has revealed that there is no immediate need for further industrial land in this location. As there are no <b>deliverable</b> proposals identified, and to accommodate the wishes of Friends of Black Patch Park to retain the Park area, these allocations have been removed. The land will therefore form a green focal point for any development which takes place on the adjoining sites. The Preferred Option for land adjacent to Soho Foundry has been allocated for Mixed Used which can incorporate industrial and offices, and possibly leisure, community and educational facilities associated to the Foundry once a suitable re-use has been identified.

25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same basic {{configuration}} (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with {{a different type of}} fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical <b>deliverable</b> fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

500|$|On 20 December, {{soon after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into the war, Compton was placed {{in charge of the}} {{plutonium}} project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. [...] Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts. It fell to Compton to decide which of these should be pursued. He proposed an ambitious schedule that aimed to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a <b>deliverable</b> atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} test of {{an atomic}} bomb represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power, reaffirming {{its status as a}} great power, although not a superpower, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the Special Relationship were soon dashed. On 1 November 1952, the United States conducted Ivy Mike, the first successful test of a true thermonuclear device (also known as a hydrogen bomb). Due to its physical size and use of cryogenic liquid deuterium, it was not suitable for use as a <b>deliverable</b> weapon, but the Castle Bravo test on 1 March 1954 used a much smaller device with solid lithium deuteride. Due to overlooking the nuclear fusion reaction in lithium-7, the [...] yield was more than twice what had been expected, and indeed was the largest detonation the Americans would ever carry out. This resulted in widespread radioactive fallout that affected 28 Americans, 236 Marshall Islanders, and the 23 crewmen of a Japanese fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryū Maru (Lucky Dragon No. 5). Meanwhile, the Soviet Union tested Joe 4, a boosted fission weapon with a yield of [...] on 12 August 1953. This was followed by Joe 19, a true two-stage thermonuclear weapon on 20 November 1954.|$|E
