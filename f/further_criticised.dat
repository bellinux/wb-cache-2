5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
2500|$|He <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> the [...] "Western hypocrisy" [...] {{and hopes}} [...] "that many {{will want to}} get rid of their silence, to demand from the {{initiator}} of this recognizable danger , to abstinence from violence".|$|R
50|$|Forman <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> Katz for his {{inability}} {{to take into account}} novel experiences, of persons who are not trained in mystical traditions, which resemble trained mystical experiences, yet are not invoked by mystical practices. According to Forman, one can have a mystical experience, and only later recognise it as similar to those acquired in mystical traditions.|$|R
50|$|The AKP {{have also}} accused the {{opposition}} CHP and MHP of implicitly forming {{an alliance with}} Gülen, particularly during the 2014 local elections. However, CHP deputy leader Gürsel Tekin claimed on 19 January 2015 that the AKP's accusations came without evidence or foundation, <b>further</b> <b>criticising</b> to the AKP's 12 years of close alliance with the Cemaat Movement.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{the conduct of the}} war he was central to the {{planning}} of Emilio Mola's assault on the north in March 1937, having been convinced by Juan Vigón of the need for a swift resolution to the war. Franco's failure to follow this course became a bone of contention in the relationship between the two, with Kindelán regularly writing to Franco to plead with him to abandon his attacks on Valencia in favour of all-out war in the north. He <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> Franco's involvement in the long-running Battle of the Ebro and suggested that his decision to commit to this rather than an attack on Barcelona added four months to the war.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{dialogue}} with community leaders and his speech, no further attacks occurred against Muslim refugees, and a wider peace and order was soon re-established {{over the entire}} area. However, Patel was criticised by Nehru, secular Muslims, and Gandhi over his alleged wish to see Muslims {{from other parts of}} India depart. While Patel vehemently denied such allegations, the acrimony with Maulana Azad and other secular Muslim leaders increased when Patel refused to dismiss Delhi's Sikh police commissioner, who was accused of discrimination. Hindu and Sikh leaders also accused Patel and other leaders of not taking Pakistan sufficiently to task over the attacks on their communities there, and Muslim leaders <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> him for allegedly neglecting the needs of Muslims leaving for Pakistan, and concentrating resources for incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees. Patel clashed with Nehru and Azad over the allocation of houses in Delhi vacated by Muslims leaving for Pakistan; Nehru and Azad desired to allocate them for displaced Muslims, while Patel argued that no government professing secularism must make such exclusions. However, Patel was publicly defended by Gandhi and received widespread admiration and support for speaking frankly on communal issues and acting decisively and resourcefully to quell disorder and violence.|$|E
25|$|Anschutz {{planned to}} build a 'super casino' {{as one of the}} attractions, as this would create a huge {{investment}} for the company and would allow for business opportunities and further developments of the area. The super casino was to be developed and operated by Kerzner International. The association of the British Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, with Philip Anschutz, head of the entertainment group, gave rise to serious political controversy in Britain with allegations that Prescott may have used undue influence to support Anschutz's casino licence bid. Prescott had met with Anschutz on several occasions and even stayed in his ranch for a few days. They were <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> when the structure for the super-casino had already been built. In January 2007 the single trial licence for a British super casino was granted to Manchester. Thus AEG announced that the casino will not be built in the near future, and that there would not be enough investment for a high-rise hotel, designed by Richard Rogers, as well as a theatre, a cable car from Canary Wharf and an extended development that was planned adjacent to the dome structure will not be built. AEG had previously stated that there was no alternative plan if the super casino could not be located in The O2. However the space reserved for the super casino is still available for future developments.|$|E

After a series of tabloid exposés, some members of his coven {{proposed}} some rules limiting what members of the Craft should say to non-members. Valiente reports that Gardner responded {{with a set of}} Wiccan laws of his own, which he claimed were original but others suspected he had made up on the spot.

50|$|In 2003 Mark Curtis {{published}} Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World. This {{book has}} been his most successful to date. It offers a new academic approach {{to the role of}} the United Kingdom in the post 1945 world until the current the War on Terrorism. It <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> the foreign policy of Tony Blair. Curtis, defending the idea that Britain is a rogue state, describes various relations the United Kingdom undertook with repressive regimes and how he thinks these actions made the world less just.|$|R
500|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{was one of}} Cartoon Network's top-rated shows {{ever since}} its premiere, {{particularly}} with boys. While Ed, Edd n Eddy went on to garner largely positive reviews, the pilot was met with mixed reactions. Some reviewers were unenthusiastic about the episode. The Hollywood Reporter said the animation was [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "simplistic" [...] and could [...] "only be described as ugly." [...] He <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> the characters as [...] "grim and toothy" [...] and the voice work as [...] "glowering". The Times-Picayune wrote: [...] "the funniest thing about Ed, Edd and Eddy is the title." [...] Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine wrote a scathing review, considering Ed, Edd n Eddy the worst Cartoon Network show {{up to that point}} and criticising the episodes as [...] "empty adventures" [...] of pure [...] "filler" [...] with characters that were [...] "products from the school of acid-trip caricature".|$|E
500|$|Planet Bollywood gave {{a rating}} of a 7 out of 10, {{particularly}} praising the twist ending, and wrote, [...] "The Don of the 21st century is stylish with flaws, yet, you do enjoy the experience of watching it in the cinema." [...] While labelling the film a [...] "disappointment", film critic Sukanya Verma questioned Akhtar's decision behind remaking such an important film. She <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> Akhtar for taking a fairly simple but engaging storyline, strangling it mercilessly, and {{turning it into a}} shockingly unimaginative adaptation. Verma also found Khan to be inconsistent in the dual roles; however, she praised Chopra's portrayal of Roma, and wrote, [...] "The seriousness with which Priyanka Chopra plays Roma is rather notable. She is a picture of restrained toughness and bubbling seduction." [...] Giving a 1 out of 5, film critic Rajeev Masand panned the film, terming it an exercise in indulgence, and wrote, [...] "Spiffily shot and stylishly packaged, the new Don may wear a new look, but what it's clearly lacking is the raw energy, the unpredictability of Chandra Barot's original thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|A UEFA report {{released}} {{soon after the}} final branded Liverpool supporters [...] "the worst fans in Europe", with Gaillard stating: [...] "What other set of fans steal tickets from their fellow supporters {{or out of the}} hands of children?" [...] However, UEFA President Michel Platini later denied that Liverpool fans were the worst behaved in Europe. UEFA was itself criticised for poor ticket-checking procedures and for implementing insufficient measures to deal with the large number of fans. Simon Gass, the British ambassador to Greece, said, [...] "Clearly there was some element of breakdown where those fake tickets appeared to be legitimate – that's something UEFA must look at." [...] Meanwhile, Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks described UEFA's allocation of 17,000 tickets to each team, knowing that Liverpool would be bringing 40,000 supporters, as [...] "insane" [...] and accused Gaillard of blaming Liverpool fans in order to cover up for his own mistakes. UEFA was <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> by Milan and Liverpool for their lack of provision for the clubs' disabled fans, providing the clubs with only sixteen disabled tickets each.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 Naik, at the {{invitation}} of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, made an appearance at the University of Melbourne, where he argued that only Islam gave women true equality. He said the more [...] "revealing Western dress" [...] makes women more susceptible to rape. Sushi Das of The Age commented that [...] "Naik extolled the moral and spiritual superiority of Islam and lampooned other faiths and the West in general", <b>further</b> <b>criticising</b> that Naik's words [...] "fostered a spirit of separateness and reinforced prejudice".|$|R
5000|$|Fairytale Fights {{received}} mixed reviews, with a 51% {{average score}} on the Xbox 360 format on Metacritic. Some critics were more positive about it, such as Games Master magazine in the UK, which called it [...] "a likeable, if slight, slice of gory Brothers Grimm gaming". However, many sources were considerably more scathing. IT Reviews said that [...] "the dodgy controls combined with some awkward camera viewpoints, plus the overly repetitive levels, slowly sap much of the joy from the experience". GameSpot went <b>further,</b> <b>criticising</b> the game's lack of pacing, lousy boss fights and [...] "shallow, repetitive combat".|$|R
5000|$|He <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> the [...] "Western hypocrisy" [...] {{and hopes}} [...] "that many {{will want to}} get rid of their silence, to demand from the {{initiator}} of this recognizable danger Israel, to abstinence from violence".Finally he demands that an [...] "unhindered and permanent control of the Israeli nuclear arsenal and the Iranean nuclear complexes by an international authority will be allowed by the governments of both countries"; only this way [...] "Israelis, Palestinians, and even more everybody who is living face to face as enemies in this region occupied by delusion and craziness, and last not least ourselves, can be helped".|$|R
500|$|Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot {{was more}} {{critical}}. He called it [...] "a clone of the original", and criticised {{the lack of}} split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from Edge; he described the game as [...] "virtually indistinguishable" [...] from the first Ridge Racer, and commented that Ridge Racer Revolution does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that {{it is simply a}} [...] "jazzed-up" [...] Ridge Racer 2, and [...] the visuals were criticised as [...] "antiquated". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as [...] "varied". A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the original Ridge Racer was rushed {{in order to make it}} out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with Virtua Fighter Remix, [...] "Namco has simply released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be [...] "a half-step away from being conned". Will Groves of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the game as [...] "a poor sequel", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as [...] "great", but <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.|$|E
500|$|... "Infinity" [...] {{garnered}} {{a positive}} response from critics, many of whom complimented its throwback feel, as well as Carey's vocals and songwriting. Billboard was complimentary of the song, writing [...] "The throwback-flavored track is a soaring break-up track, complete with sassy lines that shut down the guy she's singing about." [...] Mansfield and Wass both complimented the non sequitur lyrical couplet of [...] "Boy you so corny like Fritos" [...] and [...] "If life was a game you’re a free throw". Mansfield further noted that although [...] "Infinity" [...] does not [...] "recapture the glory" [...] of past singles [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993) and [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1995), [...] "it sure gets the sound right," [...] while Wass wrote that [...] "Infinity" [...] showcases Carey's vocal range and [...] "knack for writing hilarious one-liners." [...] D’Addario echoed Wass's sentiment regarding the couplet, writing that the song is [...] "full of Carey’s trademark askew wit". Unterberger concluded his review by writing that no other singer could perform [...] "Infinity" [...] as well as Carey. Although Camp wrote that [...] "Infinity" [...] delivers everything listeners have come to grow accustomed to hearing from Carey, such as whistle notes and [...] "sudden shifts from chest to head voice", she disapproved of the drawn out [...] "non-hook". She <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> the song's melodic structure, writing that it appeared to cover up Carey's [...] "ailing voice". Despite praising the song, several critics wrote that [...] "Infinity" [...] was unlikely to become her nineteenth number-one on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
2500|$|In a more {{critical}} review Polygons Philip Kollar {{noted that he}} felt the open-world environment felt empty. He <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> the game's aggressive and expensive downloadable content plan. He stated that while the content is not forced on the player [...] "it feels like the game is desperate to squeeze your wallet empty." [...] Kollar said that Forza Horizon [...] "is at its best when it drops the sim pretence and embraces its arcade nature".|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his work in physics, Weinstein wrote several philosophical works. Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910) examined the origins and development of a great many philosophical areas, including the broadest and most far-reaching examination of the theological theory of Pandeism written up to that point. A critique reviewing Weinstein's work in this field deemed Pandeism to be an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin. The reviewer <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> Weinstein's broad assertions that such historical philosophers as Scotus Erigena, Anselm of Canterbury, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Mendelssohn, and Lessing all were Pandeists or leaned towards Pandeism.|$|R
5000|$|While Connexus won the task, Lord Sugar was unimpressed with Selina, {{remarking}} {{that the}} gamble {{on the party}} bags {{could easily have been}} avoided if she had the client's contact details, with Richard <b>further</b> <b>criticising</b> her for making an unreasonable request on him to personalise a bag during the party, as it went against his tight schedule and his efforts to keep costs down. The team also received negative feedback on the delays with their food, which was caused by Vana voicing concerns on the team's cake repeatedly, to the point that Richard had to maintain strict control on her in their kitchen; Vana later remarked he had been irritating to work with, feeling he had been on a power-trip in the task.|$|R

[...] Gove was <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> at the May 2013 conference of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), for what they claimed was a climate of bullying, fear and intimidation during his time as Education Secretary.

The head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, criticised Livni for the statement and <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> the Security Council for not responding faster to the crisis.

500|$|Rose {{suggested}} that Murray's {{books on the}} witch-cult [...] "contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning". He accepted that her case [...] "could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it". Highlighting {{that there is a}} gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He <b>further</b> <b>criticises</b> Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as [...] "a view grounded on ignorance alone".|$|R
50|$|Just 17 months later, on 10 June 1869, another {{explosion}} occurred killing 53 men and boys.

2500|$|In a {{more general}} sense, it {{says there is a}} [...] "danger of the growing European Union {{becoming}} a world superpower in its own right" [...] and that it could be a participant in potential [...] "resource wars" [...] of the 21st century, something it says Ireland cannot support as it would end up [...] "swapping British domination for European domination". It <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> the EU as taking a [...] "highly centralised political and economic power-bloc" [...] whose decision making is made in what they termed [...] "completely undemocratic institutions"; and that EU bureaucrats work against the interest of small farmers and restructure industry so that the EU centre can prosper at our expense. Amongst all these issues it said that Ireland's neutrality is under threat.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{speculation}} about an eventual merger with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), formerly the main Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, but now smaller than Sinn Féin.

The former leader of the SDLP, Margaret Ritchie, has also stated publicly that she opposes any merger famously announcing to the Labour Party Conference that such a merger would not happen on her [...] "watch".

2500|$|Turkey {{has been}} <b>further</b> <b>criticised</b> for {{allowing}} individuals {{from outside the}} region to enter its territory and join ISIL in Syria. With many Islamist fighters passing through Turkey to fight in Syria, Turkey {{has been accused of}} becoming a transit country for such fighters and has been labelled the [...] "Gateway to Jihad". Turkish border patrol officers are reported to have deliberately overlooked those entering Syria, upon payment of a small bribe. A report by Sky News exposed documents showing that passports of foreign Islamists wanting to join ISIL by crossing into Syria had been stamped by the Turkish government.

Large companies have <b>further</b> been <b>criticised</b> of contributing to obesity through supplying schools with branded sponsorships and sports merchandise such as rugby balls that flaunt a company's logo (Cartere, 2009).
