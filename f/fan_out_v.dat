5000|$|Severe storms have a {{very strong}} updraft. The rising air parcels in that column {{accelerate}} and will overshoot the equilibrium level before being pulled back by negative buoyancy. This mean the cloud tops will reach higher levels than the surrounding cloud in the updraft region. This overshooting top will be noticeable by a colder temperature region in the thunderstorm on infrared images. Another signature associated with this situation is the Enhanced-V feature where the cold cloud tops forming at the overshooting top <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> in a <b>V</b> shape as cloud matter is blown downwind at that level. [...] Both features can be seen on visible satellite imagery, during daytime, by the shadows they cast on surrounding clouds.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{thorough}} performance comparison of three widely used probabilistic gossip algorithms over well-known random graphs. These graphs represent some large-scale network topologies: Bernoulli (or Erdos-Rényi) graph, random geometric graph, and scale-free graph. In order to conduct such a fair comparison, particularly {{in terms of}} reliability, we propose a new parameter, called effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out.</b> For a given topology and gossip algorithm, the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> characterizes the mean dissemination power of infected sites. For large-scale networks, the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> has thus a strong linear correlation with message complexity. It enables to make an accurate analysis {{of the behavior of}} a gossip algorithm over a topology. Furthermore, it simplifies the theoretical comparison of different gossip algorithms on the topology. Based on extensive experiments on top of OMNet++ simulator, which make use of the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out,</b> we discuss the impact of topologies and gossip algorithms on performance, and how to combine them to have the best gain in terms of reliability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{refactoring}} is {{to reduce}} software complexity and hence simplify the maintenance process. In this paper, we explore the impact of refactorings on "FanIn" and "FanOut" coupling metrics through extraction of refactoring data from multiple releases of five Java open-source systems, We first considered how a single refactoring modified these metric values, what happened when refactorings had been applied to a single class in unison and finally, what influence a set of refactorings had on the shape of Fan In and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> distributions. Results indicated that, on average, refactored classes tended to have larger FanIn and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> values when compared with non-refactored classes. Where evidence of multiple (different) refactorings applied to the same class was found, the net effect (in terms of FanIn and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> coupling values) was negligible...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} recent experimental evidence which questions {{the validity of}} the <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> hypothesis, a mixed fan hypothesis is proposed. The hypothesis combines <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> for the less-preferred region of probability triangles with fanning in for the more preferred region, and is defined over general probability spaces. The relevance of fanning hypotheses for economic analysis is illustrated with an asset demand example, and a new method for testing for fanning behavior is proposed. 1...|$|R
