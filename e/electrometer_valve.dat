5000|$|The Radiac Survey Meter No 2 or RSM was a 1955-meter {{which used}} an {{ionisation}} chamber to measure gamma radiation, it could measure beta, {{by removing the}} base-plate and opening the beta shield. This meter suffered {{from a number of}} disadvantages: it required three different types of batteries, of which two were obsolete and had to be manufactured to special order, the circuit included a single <b>electrometer</b> <b>valve</b> or tube. These were favored as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and remained in use until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. Within the ROC the RSM was only used at post sites for three years when it was superseded in 1958 by the FSM and the RSM retained only for post attack mobile monitoring missions.|$|E

Carbon monoxide is a far superior gas to carbon dioxide as a carrier for the oxygen isotopes because of the more rapid pump-out and almost complete absence of memory in the mass spectrometer. The slight variation of the measured ratio with output voltage is attributed mainly to the non-ohmic response of the grid resistors to the <b>electrometer</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. <b>Valves</b> designed for <b>electrometer</b> use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10âˆ’15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|R
