25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large <b>earthmoving</b> <b>equipment</b> and a concrete dam wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|E
40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear behavior of different hardfacing electrodes deposited on mild steel used for <b>earthmoving</b> <b>equipments</b> and agricultural implements was studied using the dry sand rubber wheel abrasion test. The result shows that different hardfacing electrodes {{as well as}} the weld procedure variation using similar electrodes have large effects on low stress abrasion resistance of the deposit. Such effects on the abrasion wear resistance are mainly attributed to the variation in deposit chemistry and microstructures. Carbon content {{is an important factor in}} determining microstructure of such hard facing electrodes and therefore abrasion wear resistance. Furthermore, the wear behaviour also indicated that the {{abrasive wear}} resistance is not simply related to the hardness of the deposit but is determined by the carbides and matrix structure of the deposits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Scrapers are {{advantageous}} <b>earthmoving</b> construction <b>equipments</b> as {{they are}} independently capable of excavating, hauling, and placing soil. Determining the suitable and the most economical selection of the size, model, and number of scrapers and pushers is a complex process that depends on multiple {{factors such as the}} haul-road conditions, equipment performance, operation’s travel time, etc. Equipment selection is the first and the most important decision made by a contracting firm. The right choice of equipment determines competitiveness as well as profitability. Therefore, this paper presents a prototype knowledge-based decision support system for scraper selection and cost estimation. The system is developed through employing Visual Rule Studio ® (an object oriented COM-compliant expert system development environment for windows) as an ActiveX Designer under Microsoft Visual Basic 6. 0 environment since it combines the advantages of both production rules and object-oriented programming technology. Also, using Component Object Model (COM) technology in designing and integrating the different components of the prototype system will assure software interoperability between these components. The architecture, the development and the implementation of the prototype system are discussed in details. A typical example is also presented to demonstrate the application of the prototype system.
