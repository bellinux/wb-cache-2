25|$|VMware Workstation {{includes}} {{the ability to}} group multiple virtual machines in an inventory <b>folder.</b> The <b>machines</b> in such a folder can then be powered on and powered off as a single object, useful for testing complex client-server environments.|$|R
50|$|Folding {{machines}} exclusively {{used for}} folding paper are {{commonly referred to}} as paper <b>folders.</b> These <b>machines</b> are typically used for creating letter folds (C Folds) and accordion folds (Z Folds). Other commonly used folds include a half fold, fold-out, double parallel fold, gate (brochure) fold, and right angle fold.|$|R
50|$|Individual {{file and}} folder, and system state restore: files, <b>folders,</b> or the <b>machine’s</b> system state can be {{restored}} from the command line using WBAdmin.|$|R
5000|$|... nVIR 0 {{resource}} holds {{a counter}} that {{is set to}} 1000 on the first infection of the system. Each reboot decrements the counter by 1. Each application launch decrements it by 2. When the counter reaches 0, nVIR will beep 1 out of 8 reboots and 1 of 4 infected application launches. If MacinTalk is installed in the <b>machine's</b> System <b>folder,</b> the <b>machine</b> may occasionally say [...] "Don't Panic". Otherwise, it may beep unexpectedly.|$|R
50|$|Tabbles {{implements}} a relational {{approach to}} file and data management, {{as an extension}} to the traditional file management being hierarchically structured, similar to Microsoft's WinFS. Files, emails and bookmarks are categorized by labeling them with tags, instead of placing them in hierarchical folders or containers. The data is then browsed, sorted and retrieved by navigating and searching through tags, or combination of tags. Tags are visualised and browsed as virtual folders. A relational file system is generated dynamically, independently from the physical location of the data. This allows for files or emails physically stored in different <b>folders</b> or <b>machines,</b> to be grouped and browsed together at once.|$|R
50|$|Twango {{members can}} upload their media {{in a variety}} of ways. Users can upload via the website, either through a basic upload {{interface}} where the user browses for files to upload one at a time, or through a web based drag and drop uploader which enables them to upload multiple files at once by dragging them from a <b>folder</b> on their <b>machine</b> and onto the browser (this requires ActiveX or Java).|$|R
40|$|The basic {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} provide an algorithm to solve the problem, when all clients are relying on a single server. Due to planned server downtime or from server failures the database becomes unavailable; all of the remote workers will be disconnected from their data. Data is stored on their system (user system). When the user connected to the internet data automatically sink from their client system to the server in serial order and it also works on file handling. When the system is disconnected from the network all the files (images) uploaded by user, saved on the client <b>machine</b> <b>folder</b> when it is again connected to the server, automatically files (images) transferred from client to server...|$|R
