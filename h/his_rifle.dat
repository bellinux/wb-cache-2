5|$|Ike {{reported}} {{in his testimony}} afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and to fight him {{right there in the}} courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Ike was fined $25 plus court costs and after paying the fine left unarmed. Virgil told Ike he would leave Ike's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} training McKellar {{was deemed}} to have exceptional eyesight which {{earned him a}} reputation as a good marksman in air-to-air combat. Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, would ensure that the mind and body were always at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for <b>his</b> <b>rifle,</b> along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|Later in the morning, Ike {{picked up}} <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and {{revolver}} from the West End Corral, {{where he had}} deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held.|$|E

Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with <b>his</b> <b>rifle,</b> but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye {{and good luck to}} them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults will be able to return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E
5|$|The {{company is}} sent on patrol up a river {{but with the}} inexperienced 1st Lieutenant George Band at its head. As Japanese {{artillery}} fire falls close to their positions; Band orders some men to scout upriver, with Witt volunteering to go along. They encounter an advancing Japanese column and are attacked. To buy time for Corporal Fife {{to go back and}} inform the rest of the unit, Witt draws away the Japanese but is then encircled by one of their squads, who demand that he surrender. He raises <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and is gunned down. The company is able to retreat safely, and Witt is later buried by Welsh and his squadmates. C Company receives a new commander, Captain Bosche and boards a waiting LCT, departing from the island.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high above his head, clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E

Vermillion tried to retrieve <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|As Viet Cong fire {{increased}} in intensity, {{the soldiers of}} Delta Company picked up the distinctive sound of a U.S.-made M-60 machine-gun firing from the southern flank. Allen assumed that Alpha Company was approaching his perimeter, so he ordered them to cease-fire because he feared <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> companies were firing on each other. However, the order was also passed down along the formation of Delta Company, which enabled the Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment to gain fire superiority. At around 11:35am, Triet unleashed his 2nd Battalion which was placed in reserve during the battle, and they attacked Welch's Delta Company from three different directions. During that time Allen tried to request artillery support, but that had become impossible due to the close proximity between U.S. and Viet Cong soldiers. In a scene that had characterized the destruction of Alpha Company earlier, both Allen and Welch were wounded in battle as Viet Cong snipers fired down from the trees. Nonetheless, just before 12:00pm, Allen instructed Delta Company to begin a northward march toward the battalion's base, and Bravo Company to move forward to cover the withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} production rifles by Roy Weatherby {{were built}} on commercial Mauser actions by FN, Brevex (magnum), and Mathieu (left hand). For bespoke rifles, Weatherby would build to a customer's specifications, using any action the customer wanted, provided it {{was strong enough}} for the desired cartridge. For many years, Weatherby manufactured <b>his</b> <b>rifles</b> at <b>his</b> small facility in South Gate, California. But in 1956, he contracted with Sako to build <b>his</b> production <b>rifles</b> on Weatherby-FN Mauser actions. Custom rifles were still produced in South Gate, however.|$|R

5|$|Attempts to outflank the bunkers were {{answered}} with heavy fire from a Japanese medium machine gun {{and another man}} was killed and three more wounded. As the attack began to falter, one of the wounded, 20-year-old Private Frank Partridge, who had been injured in the arm and thigh, braved the heavy fire that was being put down towards him and gathered the Bren light machine gun from the gunner who had been killed. After pouring suppressing fire onto the bunker, he discarded the Bren and regathered <b>his</b> <b>rifle,</b> before rushing towards the bunker with a grenade and killing its occupants. Partridge's actions reinvigorated the attack and allowed the Australians to temporarily take the second Japanese position. After the wounded were recovered, the Australians withdrew having lost three men killed and five wounded. Against this eight Japanese were confirmed to have been killed. For his actions during the attack on 24 July, Partridge was awarded the Victoria Cross, the British Commonwealth's highest military decoration. He was the last Australian to be awarded the medal during the Second World War, and was also the youngest.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{returned}} to Kentucky after the congressional session. He responded to Governor Isaac Shelby's call for volunteers {{to serve in}} William Henry Harrison's campaign into Upper Canada. He was commissioned a major general and given command of the 2nd Division of Kentucky militia. The 3,500-man division, composed of the 2nd and 5th Brigades and the 11th Regiment, assembled on the Ohio River at Newport, Kentucky. They joined Harrison in forcing the British retreat from Detroit and held the Indian allies of the British off his left flank during the American victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813. According to historian Bennett H. Young, Desha's old friend William Whitley had a premonition of his own death {{the night before the}} battle and gave <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and powderhorn to Desha, asking him to convey it to his widow, along with a message of his affection. Whitley was indeed killed in the fighting the following day.|$|E

5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2000, {{a patrol}} from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers {{attached}} to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and the company commander—Major Alan Marshall—decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track {{that led to the}} village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> and was beaten. He {{and the rest of the}} patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creak and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the other side of the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired <b>his</b> <b>rifle</b> too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
