5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, Chuck Yeager also writes, however, {{that part}} of the {{ingrained}} culture of test flying at the time, due to the fearsome mortality rates of the pilots, was anger directed at pilots who died in test flights, to avoid being overcome by sorrow for lost comrades. Bong's brother Carl (who wrote his biography) questions the validity of reported circumstance that Bong repeated the same mistake so soon after mentioning it to another pilot. Carl's book—Dear Mom, So We <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>War</b> (1991)—contains numerous reports and findings from the crash investigations.|$|E

Moxley wondered why Jacobs attacked him, then both proceeded to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of words with each other in the back. On August 21 at IPW 9th Anniversary: Reign of the Insane, Moxley defeated Jacobs to successfully retain the IPW World Heavyweight Championship. On October 2 at Shocktoberfest, Moxley defeated Drake Younger in a Three Stages of Insanity match to successfully retain the IPW World Heavyweight Championship. On January 1, 2011 at Showdown in Naptown, Moxley lost the IPW World Heavyweight Championship to Jimmy Jacobs in a dog collar match due to referee stoppage.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{was generally not}} well known or understood during the war. The English people {{thought of it as}} a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India were more interested in the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of Baghdad. Australia did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> correspondent in the area until Captain Frank Hurley, the first Australian Official Photographer, arrived in August 1917 after visiting the Western Front. Henry Gullett, the first Official War Correspondent, arrived in November 1917. The long-lasting effect of this {{campaign was}} the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, when France won the mandate for Syria and Lebanon, while the British Empire won the mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Republic of Turkey came into existence in 1923 after the Turkish War of Independence ended the Ottoman Empire. The European mandates ended with the formation of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, the Lebanese Republic in 1943, the State of Israel in 1948, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan and Syrian Arab Republic in 1946.|$|E
500|$|The two superpowers had by {{this point}} {{abandoned}} their strategy of détente {{and in response to}} the Soviet deployment of SS-20s, Reagan moved to deploy cruise and Pershing II missiles to Europe. The Soviet Union's involvement in a war in Afghanistan was in its third year, a matter which was also contributing to international tension. In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, Time magazine published an issue with Andropov on the cover. When Smith viewed the edition, she asked her mother, [...] "If people are so afraid of him, why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> or not?".

500|$|Parker {{had every}} reason to expect that to occur again. The Regulars would march to Concord, find nothing, and return to Boston, tired but empty-handed. He {{positioned}} his company carefully. [...] He placed them in parade-ground formation, on Lexington Common. [...] They were in plain sight (not hiding behind walls), but not blocking the road to Concord. [...] They made a show of political and military determination, but no effort to prevent the march of the Regulars. Many years later, one of the participants recalled Parker's words as being what is now engraved in stone {{at the site of the}} battle: [...] "Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> let it begin here."

500|$|According to Tim Skelton, {{author of}} Lutyens and Great War, [...] "if {{there was one}} village above all others that would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> {{memorial}} designed by Lutyens, {{it would be the}} village of Mells". The war memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures by Lutyens in the village. He was a friend of two prominent local families, the Horners and the Asquiths, through his collaborations with Gertrude Jekyll on country houses and gardens early in his career. Gertrude's sister-in-law was Dame Agnes Jekyll, the sister of Lady Frances Horner, who was the incumbent owner (with her husband, Sir John) of Mells Manor, a manor house in the centre of the village dating originally from the 16th century. Shortly after their first meeting, Sir John commissioned Lutyens for renovations to the Horners' London town house. Lutyens first visited Mells in 1896 at the request of Lady Horner (with whom he became close friends), who commissioned him to rebuild the house, and later for several other works related to the manor.|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E
500|$|Norwich {{was among}} the last of Lutyens' {{memorials}} to be built. Many towns and cities built memorials soon {{after the end of}} the First World War, but early [...] attempts in Norwich proved abortive, each mired in controversy. A scheme to build an agricultural college to serve as a memorial reached the point of soliciting donations, but these had to be returned when the scheme was abandoned as being too ambitious and not appealing to all social classes. When Charles Bignold was elected Lord Mayor of Norwich in 1926, he was determined that the city would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> memorial before he left office. He took the initiative and commissioned Lutyens and the two men selected a site to the east of the Guildhall when the architect visited the city on 13 June 1927. Adamant that the project should benefit the living as well as provide a monument to the dead, Bignold established the Joint Hospitals and War Memorial Appeal to raise funds for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital and the Jenny Lind Children's Hospital, as well as a physical monument. The target was £35,000, of which £4,000 was to be allocated to a memorial. The memorial would not have space for the names of Norwich's 3,544 war dead, so Lutyens was also commissioned to design the Norwich Roll of Honour. An further £800–£1,000 was allocated and Lutyens produced a set of oak panels which fold out to reveal the names painted on the inside.|$|E

In June 2012 during a Face the Nation interview Romney stated regarding military action against Iran: [...] "I don’t believe at this stage, therefore, if I’m president that we need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> powers approval or special authorization for military force." ...|$|E

The church also issued a statement clarifying the Kerry assertions, [...] "Those who know our church and Pastor Ed know that we often say things in a humorous, tongue in cheek manner.

2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E
2500|$|Polanski's first feature-length film, Knife in the Water, {{was also}} one of the first {{significant}} Polish films after the Second World War that did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> theme. Scripted by [...] Jerzy Skolimowski, Jakub Goldberg, and Polanski, Knife in the Water is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. A dark and unsettling work, Polanski's debut feature subtly evinces a profound pessimism about human relationships with regard to the psychological dynamics and moral consequences of status envy and sexual jealousy. Knife in the Water was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1963. Leon Niemczyk, who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film. Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool.|$|E

2500|$|Port Sunlight is {{the site}} of a soap factory founded by William Lever (1851–1925) who also created a model village for his workers. [...] During the First World War Lever was {{chairman}} of the Empire War Memorial League, and was anxious to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> memorial in Port Sunlight. [...] He was concerned {{that at the end of}} the war the best sculptors would have been engaged to work on war memorials, and as early as 1916 he commissioned Goscombe John to design a memorial for the village. [...] Lever had been concerned that England would be invaded and at the start of the First World War, although he was then aged 63, he joined the Birkenhead and District Volunteer Training Corps (the forerunner of what would become the Home Guard in the Second World War). [...] Consequently, the theme of the memorial was to be the [...] "Defence of the Realm", an unusual theme for war memorials. [...] As an invasion would threaten the people left at home, Lever was keen to invoke a sense of social cohesion, and so figures of women and children would be included in the memorial as well as military personnel.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Kaine {{argued that}} the U.S. {{military}} intervention against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization {{for the use of}} military force against ISIL. In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> without Congress. You can't ask people to risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing other folks getting killed or injured if Congress isn't willing to do the job to put their thumbprint on this and say, this is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
