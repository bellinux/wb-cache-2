25|$|One night, Pu Tong Seal {{was very}} tired from his all-day journey on foot, {{and began to}} fall asleep in the jungle. The moment he <b>dozed</b> <b>off,</b> a tiger {{attacked}} him. He {{seemed to have a}} sixth sense, even when resting. The warlord never took chances, day or night, but was always alert for the unexpected ambush whether by human or animal. He bent the tiger's body so hard that the spinal cord broke, and the tiger died on the spot.|$|E
25|$|A 16th-century {{physician}} {{wrote that}} many laborers <b>dozed</b> <b>off</b> exhausted {{at the start}} of each night; sexual intercourse with their wives typically occurring in the watching period, after a recuperative first sleep. Anthropologists find that isolated societies without electric light sleep in a variety of patterns; seldom do they resemble our modern habit of sleeping in one single eight-hour bout. Much has been written about dream interpretation, from biblical times to Freud, but sleep itself was historically seen as a passive state of not-awake.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{the aging}} leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, {{much of the}} {{high-level}} work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin. These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin, who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favored by Stalin. Stolen from the West, they lacked subtitles. The dictator had the meal served at around 1a.m., and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance a traditional Ukrainian dance. Khrushchev did so, later stating, [...] "When Stalin says dance, a wise man dances." [...] Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch {{so that he would}} not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, [...] "Things went badly for those who <b>dozed</b> <b>off</b> at Stalin's table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{generally}} {{a woman of}} few and soft-spoken words, Princess Alice was known for her dry humour. While driving home from Winston Churchill's funeral in 1965, she was badly injured after her husband fell {{asleep at the wheel}} (or possibly had a stroke). On the occasion she wrote [...] "I was sitting beside him to grab the wheel or put my foot on the brake if he fell asleep and lost control, but on that occasion I must have <b>dozed</b> <b>off</b> myself. Apparently the Rolls swerved off the road (and) ended upside down in a field of cabbages. Prince Henry had luckily been thrown through the open door...into (stinging) nettles and brambles". On another occasion, soon after her marriage, when the couple moved to York House, they were warned that the drawing-room floor would not stand the weight of more than twenty people [...] "so we made a party list" [...] recalled the Duchess many years later [...] "of the twenty-one people we disliked most".|$|E
2500|$|An {{exquisite}} literary perfectionist, {{akin to the}} 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages [...] "covered {{with fine}} lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut for a page...". He worked [...] "long hours with great concentration". According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. [...] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style [...] "Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts {{by as much as}} two-thirds". The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt [...] "free" [...] and able to concentrate, [...] "writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy", until he instantaneously <b>dozed</b> <b>off.</b> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. [...] Saint-Exupéry stated {{it was the only way}} he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.|$|E
2500|$|Child labour {{existed before}} the Industrial Revolution {{but with the}} {{increase}} in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders, 10–20% of an adult male's wage. Children as young as four were employed. Beatings and long hours were common, with some child coal miners and hurriers working from 4 am until 5 pm. Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they <b>dozed</b> <b>off</b> and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions. Many children developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of 25. Workhouses would sell orphans and abandoned children as [...] "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging. Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters shackling them to prevent escape. Children employed as mule scavengers by cotton mills would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated. Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop phossy jaw. Children employed at glassworks were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at potteries were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.|$|E
