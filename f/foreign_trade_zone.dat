30|$|In the United States {{the process}} began early in twentieth century with the {{creation}} of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Zones</b> (FTZ) following the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and accelerated after World War II (Tiefenbrun, 2012). In the 1950 s, FTZ were allowed to have manufacturing activities. The success of FTZ was mitigated by the protected status of American industries that were under customs barriers with a large enough domestic market. However, in the 1970 s trade liberalization (the outcome of a succession of GATT rounds) enabled a greater access to the American market by foreign firms. American manufacturers started to look for new ways to take advantages of the cost arbitrage offered by international markets; <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> <b>zones</b> were such a tool and grew rapidly to include all the main maritime, air and land ports of entry. There were around 50 <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> <b>zones</b> in 1979, around 100 in 1984, more than 200 in 1993 and more than 230 in 2015.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In 2008, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the 110 th Congress (HR 6415) to address the “unintended consequences” of US free trade agreements (US FTA) on manufacturers operating in US <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> <b>zones</b> (FTZs). Presently, US manufacturers operating in FTZs that use imported components pay a tariff (on finished goods entering the US market), which is not paid by their competitors in countries that have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the USA. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the implications of a legislative proposal to address this issue (the bill is still under consideration and not yet been passed by Congress) for domestic firms and the overall economy. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is largely based on the analysis of the legislative proposal (HR 6415), and US trade data obtained from the United Nations. Findings – The paper shows that the trade agreement parity (TAP) proposal may have the undesirable effect of encouraging local firms (in US FTZs) to use foreign components and increasing the trade deficit. It also shows that the proposal, by facilitating the entry of more foreign imports undermines the original purpose for which FTZs were designed. Originality/value – There are no papers examining the implications of this Congressional bill on domestic competition and the overall US economy. This paper and its recommendations will help US policymakers to re-evaluate the existing proposal and also revisit the role of FTZs in the US economy. <b>Foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>trade</b> <b>zones,</b> Free <b>trade,</b> International trade, Legislation, Trade agreement parity, United States of America...|$|R

2500|$|Established in 1921, the bi-state Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in {{addition}} to overseeing maritime facilities, {{is responsible for the}} vehicular crossings and the rapid transit system between New York and New Jersey, several of the region's airports, and other transportation and real estate development projects. The Port Authority maintains its own police force, as does the Waterfront Commission, created in 1953 to investigate, prosecute, and prevent criminal activity. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which has been involved in harbor maintenance since about 1826, when Congress passed an omnibus rivers and harbors act, is responsible for bulkhead and channel maintenance. The United States Coast Guard deals with issues such as floatable debris, spills, vessel rescues, and counter-terrorism. Both states, and some municipal governments – in particular New York City – maintain maritime police units, while the United States Park Police monitors federal properties. The National Park Service oversees some of the region's historic sites, nature reserves, and parks.
