The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is meeting these challenges by developing a <b>general</b> <b>cross</b> support concept, <b>reference</b> model, and service specifications for Space Link Extension services for space missions involving cross support among Space Agencies. This paper identifies and bounds the problem, describes the need to extend Space Link services, gives an overview of the operations concept, and introduces complimentary CCSDS work on standardizing Space Link Extension services...|$|R

Consideration of international, national or regional health priorities tends to drive the criteria utilised to prioritise clinical guidelines. This addendum to the NCEC Clinical Guideline Screening and Prioritisation Criteria Version 2 (2012) describes {{an overview of the}} international approaches taken to clinical guideline prioritisation and a summary of the <b>general</b> prioritisation criteria <b>cross</b> <b>referenced</b> with a number of key sources.

40|$|When {{identifying}} and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts {{need to follow}} the <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions. Enabling easier navigation and handling of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> requires automated support {{for the detection of}} the natural language expressions used in <b>cross</b> <b>references,</b> the interpretation of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> in their context, and the linkage of <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool sup- port for automated detection and resolution of <b>cross</b> <b>references.</b> The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal <b>cross</b> <b>reference</b> expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg’s legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English. We report on an empirical evaluation where we assess the accuracy and scalability of our framework over several Luxembourgish legislative texts as well as PHIPA...|$|R

50|$|The {{chronology}} of the Hebrew kings rests primarily {{on a series}} of reign lengths and <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern kingdom of Judah or the northern kingdom of Israel. Unfortunately some of these <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a <b>cross</b> <b>reference</b> that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years.|$|R
