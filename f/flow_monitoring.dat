25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air <b>flow</b> <b>monitoring</b> and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E

The Fissile Mass <b>Flow</b> <b>Monitor</b> is designed to measure the mass flow of fissile material through a gaseous or liquid process stream.

This methodology was chosen by DOE/NE for implementation in November 1996, and the hardware/software development is complete. Successful BDMS installation and operation of the complete BDMS has been demonstrated in the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), which is operated by Lockheed Martin Utility Services, Inc. for the US Enrichment Corporation and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

40|$|International audienceInformation Flow Control at Operating System (OS) level {{features}} interesting {{properties and}} have been an active topic of research for years. However, no implementation can work reliably if there does not exist a way to correctly and precisely track all information flows occurring in the system. The existing implementations for Linux {{are based on the}} Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework which implements hooks at speciic points in code where any security mechanism may interpose a security decision in the execution. However, previous works on the verification of LSM only addressed access control and no work has raised the question of the reliability of information flow control systems built on LSM. In this work, we present a compiler-assisted and reproducible static analysis on the Linux kernel to verify that the LSM hooks are correctly placed with respect to operations generating information flows so that LSM-based information <b>flow</b> <b>monitors</b> can properly track all information flows. Our results highlight flaws in LSM that we propose to solve, thus improving the suitability of this framework for the implementation of information <b>flow</b> <b>monitors...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{rigorous}} comparison of information <b>flow</b> <b>monitors</b> {{with respect to}} two dimensions: soundness and transparency. For soundness, we notice that the standard information flow security definition called Termination-Insensitive Noninterference (TINI) allows the presence of termination channels, however it does not describe whether the termination channel was present in the original program, or it was added by a monitor. We propose a stronger notion of noninterference, that we call Termination-Aware Noninterference (TANI), that captures this fact, and thus allows us to better evaluate the security guarantees of different monitors. We further investigate TANI, and state its formal relations to other soundness guarantees of information <b>flow</b> <b>monitors.</b> For transparency, we identify different notions from the literature that aim at comparing the behaviour of monitors. We notice that one common notion used in the literature is not adequate since it identifies as better a monitor that accepts insecure executions, and hence may augment {{the knowledge of the}} attacker. To discriminate between monitors' behaviours on secure and insecure executions, we factorized two notions that we call true and false transparency. These notions allow us to compare monitors that were deemed to be incomparable in the past. We analyse five widely explored information flow monitors: no-sensitive-upgrade (NSU), permissive-upgrade (PU), hybrid monitor (HM), secure multi-execution (SME), and multiple facets (MF) ...|$|R
