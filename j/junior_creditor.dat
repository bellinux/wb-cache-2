40|$|Where {{a senior}} {{creditor}} {{has access to}} two funds from the same debtor to satisfy its claims and the <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> has access to {{only one of these}} funds, it could be equitable to expect that the senior creditor satisfy itself out of the fund in which the <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> does not have an interest. Where a court makes an order based on this principle, it has invoked the doctrine of marshalling, sometimes called the two-fund rule. 2 ̆ 7 Marshalling is an equitable doctrine and therein lies its strengths and weaknesses. Equity gives it its flexibility, adaptibility and utility. Equity also gives it its uncertainty and lack of clear boundaries. Marshalling is used to prevent the arbitrary action of a senior creditor from destroying the rights or expectations of a <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> or a creditor with less security. It is used to lessen the chance that a <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> may lose its security solely at the whim of the senior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s choice of property to pursue. Marshalling is not based on the law of contracts or liens. It is founded instead in equity, being designed to promote fair dealing and justice. Equity has its limits. Use of the doctrine of marshalling is common in several different areas of the law. It is frequently used in the administration of estates to help determine the distribution of assets. This is usually called marshalling of assets and is to be distinguished from its use in settling priorities between successive encumbrancers, called marshalling of securities. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|As {{for recent}} Japanese bank behavior, there exist two inefficacies. One is credit crunch, that is, banks {{hesitate}} to lend money to new good projects. The other is excessive additional loan to bad-performing firms. These two perverse bank behaviors look like contradictive each other. In this paper, we explain these contradictive behaviors {{stem from the}} violation of the absolute priority rule (APR) among the stakeholders in Japan. Under the legal violation of priority rule, the borrowers with inefficient projects can finance from a new <b>junior</b> <b>creditor,</b> transferring the credit value of the senior creditor to the new junior one. In such a situation, {{it is the best}} behavior for the senior creditor, i. e. bank, which tries to protect the value of his senior credit, to finance the inefficient project by himself before the <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> might lend money. This behavior implies inefficient excessive additional loan. Furthermore, since banks expect not to avoid such ex-post inefficiency and the accompanied loss due to the violation of APR, they are unwilling to lend to the originally efficient project in ex-ante. This results in credit crunch. ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{reorganization}} under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code {{is built}} on {{the foundation of the}} absolute priority rule, which requires that senior creditors be paid in full before any value can be distributed to <b>junior</b> <b>creditors.</b> The standard law and economics understanding is that absolute priority follows inevitably from the 2 ̆ 2 creditors 2 ̆ 7 bargain 2 ̆ 2 model. That model tells us that the optimal system of reorganization must respect nonbankruptcy contract rights while maximizing the expected value of assets in bankruptcy. The conventional wisdom is that absolute priority fits this bill as the singular way of protecting creditors 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights. But what if this conventional wisdom is incorrect? A closer look at the structure of corporate debt suggests that it is. <b>Junior</b> <b>creditors</b> issue debt supported by the residual value of the debtor firm. The repayment of that debt is contingent on the future value of the firm: the <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> receive any future value that exceeds the face value of the senior debt. It is well recognized that this right is the equivalent of a call option on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets. And yet Chapter 11 destroys the value of that call option by collapsing all future possibilities to present-day value. Thus, absolute priority eliminates the nonbankruptcy contract rights of <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> and creates new rights in going-concern value for senior creditors. This Article examines the potential of an alternative priority mechanism that protects both the <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> 2 ̆ 7 call-option value and the senior creditors 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights. This mechanism-which I call Option-Preservation Priority-is shown to protect the nonbankruptcy contract rights of all creditors and maximize the expected value of assets in bankruptcy...|$|R

40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their right to payment will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the ranking of prebankruptcy claims against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment of their claims, senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the senior creditor the right to cast the <b>junior</b> <b>creditor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a senior creditor two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the subordinated claim. Senior creditors have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders of claims. This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{imposing}} conditionality covenants {{on the performance of}} the signatories to a sovereign credit contract. A two period model is developed in which creditors provide a loan to a sovereign conditional upon the implementation of investments. Commitment to these covenants overcome the debt repudiation problem, as it increases the likelihood of repayment, if the implemented conditionalities contribute to an increase in the sovereign’s productive capacity. A three period model is also developed to entertain the possibility that the sovereign engage in credit activities in subsequent periods, where in the final period the debtor has obligations towards <b>junior</b> and senior <b>creditors.</b> This allows for dynamic inconsistency, as the sovereign may be tempted to increase its debt in the second period, thus increasing the probability of repudiation in the third period.

40|$|We analyze bidding {{incentives}} and present direct evidence on liquidity and bid premiums in Swedish mandatory bankruptcy auctions. Three-quarters of the bankrupt firms are sold as going concerns (assets intact and financially restructured).

We analyze optimal bank-bidder coalition bid strategies, show that the coalition under certain conditions overbids, and produce crosssectional evidence consistent with overbidding. At the same time, the premium evidence fail to support asset fire-sale arguments: neither going-concern premiums nor piecemeal liquidation values are dependent of the business cycle or industry-wide distress. We also show that bids by insiders to repurchase the firm (salebacks) occur in direct competition with outside investors and result in premiums that are indistinguishable from premiums in sales to company outsiders.

We consider the desirability of various allocation schemes in a model in which senior and <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> can engage in both types of spending but the bankruptcy court cannot distinguish productive from rent seeking activities. We suppose that the senior claim is at or in the money.

40|$|Corporate {{bankruptcy}} law and judicial procedure are structured {{to ensure that}} the proceedings are fair and impartial. Just as in all judicial proceedings, judges overseeing a corporate bankruptcy are required by the rules of judicial ethics to be disinterested—that is they cannot have a direct or indirect personal stake in the proceedings.

40|$|Issues of {{corporate}} finance become most critical when a firm encounters financial distress. In this case, {{there may be}} insufficient assets to go around, {{and the question of}} valuation comes to the fore. Valuation is central to the resolution of distress because distributions consistent with the hierarchy of investor priority (called 2 ̆ 2 absolute priority 2 ̆ 2) depend on the amount available to distribute. A firm with little value may belong entirely to its most senior creditors, while a firm with much value may belong in part to its <b>junior</b> <b>creditors,</b> or perhaps even its shareholders. Not surprisingly, therefore, valuation is the most hotly contested and debated topic in the realm {{of corporate}} bankruptcy law. In this Article, we enter this debate with a new 2 ̆ 2 dilution 2 ̆ 2 approach for valuation. The dilution approach begins with the issuance of some new shares to investors at a particular level of priority, and then, to the extent that absolute priority requires, 2 ̆ 2 dilutes 2 ̆ 2 the value of those shares with the issuance of additional shares, or new claims against the firm, to investors at a different level of priority.

In the second essay, I compare the characteristics of warrants issued by firms during initial public offerings with those of warrants issued by firms emerging from bankruptcy. I show that the characteristics are very different for the warrants issued in each category. Warrants issued by firms emerging from Chapter 11 tend to have very little managerial flexibility, and are instead designed to placate <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> to allow a faster emergence from bankruptcy.

There will likely be critical junctures throughout the process when the debtor and/or its stakeholders are required to make choices that may ultimately {{have a significant impact}} on recoveries under the CDS contracts. ” Restructuring companies in respect of which there exists a significant credit default swaps (CDS) market adds an additional level of complexity which the debtor and all stakeholders should consider and assess early on in the process, as it could determine the success or failure of {{a restructuring}} plan. Creditors across the capital structure can purchase CDS protection. Where <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> with CDS protection also have cross-holdings in the senior debt, these creditors may have sufficient bargaining power to dictate the manner in which a restructuring will proceed.

Credit Events Settlement of a typical CDS contract referencing a European corporate will be triggered upon the occurrence of one of three events (each a Credit Event) : (i) a bankruptcy of the underlying corporate (the Reference Entity), (ii) a failure by the Reference Entity to make a payment on any of its outstanding borrowed money obligations or (iii) a restructuring of any outstanding borrowed money obligations of the Reference Entity.

40|$|The authors further develop such a market-based {{approach}} for {{situations in which}} claimants are severely cash-constrained and {{there is good reason}} for existing owner-managers to remain in control. Under the ACCORD scheme-Auction-based Creditor Ordering by Reducing Debts-creditors remain creditors but form a queue, to be serviced in sequence from the firm's operating cash flows. Creditors bid for their position in this queue. Those accepting greater proportionate reductions in the face value of their claims (perhaps most pessimistic about the firm's prospects) are placed ahead of theothers. A preexisting hierarchy of claims is honored by having claimants bid for their positions within the relevant segment of the queue. No one in the queue, including owners (whoa re last), is paid anything until the (reduced) debts of the first in line are fully discharged. The queue then moves up and the next claimant in line is serviced. Deferred creditors, who must wait their turn for the firm's operating cash surpluses, are not <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> in the conventional sense. The authors determine equilibrium bidding strategies, showing that the firm's aggregate debts would be reduced to a more serviceable level. This would improve the incentives of the firm's owner-managers, who remain in control, to operate the firm efficiently. Economic resources would thus be better used, and losses already incurred would be efficiently and quickly allocated among creditors. The authors suggest that ACCORD would be appropriate for East Asia, where, despite new bankruptcy laws, inexperienced courts are unlikely to nudge creditors into a quick negotiated agreement nor to be able to cope with systemic bankruptcy. Moreover, when the government is a major unsatisfied creditor, whose agents may not act in the taxpayers'best interests, market-based solutions might remove political interference from restructuring decisions. Neither owners nor creditors would be worse off than they are now.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the relative {{success of the}} Norwegian bankruptcy legislation with reference to similar mechanisms in Sweden and the U. S. Based on {{the total population of}} financially distressed Norwegian companies filing a public petition for a debt settlement proceeding since 1999; only 15 % have survived the process as a going concern. As comparable research in Sweden and the U. S. documents firm survival rates of three-quarters, this suggests that the Norwegian legislation does not provide an efficient framework for distressed firms. Further disturbing is it that the formal system is effectively unused with only 28 unique companies filing for a debt settlement in the last 18 years. The alternative to a formal debt settlement is an out-of-court financial restructuring. As the formal system is in general not considered a viable alternative, we analyse a sample of private workouts. Due to the time-consuming process of manually extracting the dataset, restrictions were necessary. Thus, with basis in Norwegian companies listed within the energy sector at Oslo Børs and Oslo Axess, we identified 22 companies that have initiated financial restructurings since 01. 01. 2015. As of 01. 04. 2017, 13 of these have completed the restructuring, which constitute the sample for the out-of-court analyses. We find average recovery rates of senior secured creditors of 95. 5 %, and junior unsecured equal to 67 %. Comparable research of Swedish bankruptcy auctions and Chapter 11 solutions indicates average recovery rates of 77 % and 80 % for secured <b>creditors,</b> whereas <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> recover 2 % and 29 %, respectively. This indicates that from a creditor perspective, out-of-court financial restructurings are at least as efficient as mechanisms in Sweden and the U. S. However, the Norwegian sample indicates deviations from the Absolute Priority Rule, which an auction procedure eliminates. The time-horizon, a proxy of the indirect costs related to the bankruptcy procedure, in Norwegian private workouts are relatively swift with a median of 6 months. Similarly, formal debt settlements in Norway require on median 5 months, while Swedish auctions are considerably faster with an average of 2 months. On the contrary, Chapter 11 solutions are heavily time-consuming with a median of 27 months. Importantly, the results are likely to suffer from a selection bias due to the necessary restrictions. The sample characteristics are strictly defined both in industry and time. Therefore, it is questionable whether the sample properly represent the population of out-of-court financial restructurings. Additionally, the sample characteristics limit the validity of the cross-country comparison as the results may reflect variations in the companies instead of differences in the procedures. Thus, the results must be treated carefully. However, due to the non-existing research on the topic, we argue that the results provide an interesting first examination and discussion of the Norwegian restructuring alternatives in a financial perspective. Overall, the analysis suggests that the Norwegian bankruptcy legislation is inefficient in securing firm survival, and secondly, that the alternative, out-of-court financial restructurings, are surprisingly efficient in securing creditor recovery rates and limiting bankruptcy costs...|$|R
40|$|Theories {{of banks}} as {{efficient}} monitors could suggest that bank debt should be <b>junior</b> to other <b>creditors</b> {{in order to}} precipitate bankruptcy when other creditors are still in-the- money. This paper provides an explanation why bank debt is usually senior: banks would more strongly contest the priority structure in financial distress if they were junior, because they are both better organized than public debt and more appreciative of a toughness reputation in repeat relationships with other clients. This paper identifies {{the conditions under which}} firms find it efficient to award the ex-post stronger lobbyist/litigant ex-ante priority, because ``deterrence'' can reduce total creditors' expenses associated with a priority contest. For equivalent reasons, the theory can advise when public debt should be senior to trade credit and/or implicit contracts, and can even suggest one rationale for the absolute priority rule (APR). Finally, there are situations in which overall creditors' contest expenses are lower when the firm pays, thus providing a rationale for Chapter~ 11 creditor reimbursement procedures. ...|$|R

Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980 s.

The data span 1914 to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big [...] for the 64 countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go a long ways toward explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic residents are strictly <b>junior</b> to external <b>creditors</b> does not find broad support. ...|$|R
40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and <b>junior</b> <b>creditors</b> regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleensä Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin läpi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhtiön maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. Tämä pääkysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisiä oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hyödyntää siten, että projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteisöt Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteistöjen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteistöjärjestelmien erojen ja yhtäläisyyksien sekä kiinteistön ulottuvuuden selvittämisestä. Kiinteistön ulottuvuudella on merkitystä sen suhteen, mitä omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteistö- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja|$|R
