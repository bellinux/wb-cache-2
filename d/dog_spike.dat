25|$|The next {{match that}} {{occurred}} was between Rick Steiner and Mike Rotunda for the NWA World Television Championship. Steiner's younger brother Scott Steiner made his NWA debut {{at the event}} and appeared at ringside with Rick to manage him. Steiner and Rotunda exchanged submission maneuvers on each other. Rotunda offered Steiner a handshake but Steiner did not shake hands with him. Rotunda applied an Abdominal Stretch and cheated near the ropes. Steiner countered the hold with an Oklahoma Roll but was in the ropes. Rotunda gained momentum and attacked Steiner in the corner with his shoulder. Steiner performed a Scoop Powerslam to Rotunda. Steiner was about to win the match until Kevin Sullivan distracted Steiner by talking about his <b>dog</b> <b>Spike.</b> Rotunda took advantage and delivered a Back Suplex to Steiner. Rotunda missed a Dropkick on Steiner and received Mounted Punches in the corner by Steiner. Steiner applied a Sleeper Hold on Rotunda. Rotunda's back fell on Steiner and Steiner's shoulders were pinned. As a result, Rotunda won the title.|$|E
500|$|On Mother's Day, toddler Angelica Pickles {{constructs}} a macaroni {{sculpture of}} her head as a present to her mother, telling the Rugrats {{the meaning of the}} holiday. After dropping off his son Chuckie, Chaz Finster gives his friend Didi Pickles a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chaz does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies Phil and Lil DeVille and Tommy Pickles look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a neonatal intensive care unit. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's <b>dog</b> <b>Spike</b> and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom Minka to a spa, and Betty DeVille helps Stu Pickles with his invention to help mothers.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>dog</b> <b>spike</b> is {{functionally}} {{equivalent to}} a cut spike and is also square in horizontal section and of similar dimensions but has a pointed penetrating head, and the rail (or [...] "plate holding") head has two lugs on either side (which aid spike removal) giving {{the impression of a}} dog's head.|$|E
50|$|A {{programme}} {{of replacing}} <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> with coach screws was then started, with problem areas receiving attention as required. Not only did this improve {{the security of}} the rails onto the sleepers resulting in a better ride quality, but also provided an obvious safety improvement too. By 2000, approximately 1/3rd of the <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> from Woody Bay through to Eleanor’s had been replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{track was}} {{completely}} renewed with new larger softwood sleepers, and 20lb rail (most of it new, generally in 18ft lengths) secured with <b>dog</b> <b>spikes.</b> Although monetary constraints prevented {{any kind of}} proper base being laid below the sleepers, fresh limestone ballast was also laid.|$|R
50|$|From the {{evidence}} available, the rail was secured using <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> to wooden sleepers {{of a small}} but long profile, although none survive to this day so {{it is difficult to}} say exactly. The Society still possesses three original 1945 metal sleepers, and a small quantity of 14lb rail, with one pair of fishplates.|$|R
2500|$|In 2179 a fire starts {{aboard the}} Colonial Marine {{spaceship}} Sulaco. The computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley, {{the young girl}} Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop; all four are in cryonic stasis. Scans of the crew's cryotubes show a queen facehugger attached to one member. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina [...] "Fury" [...] 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by male inmates with double-Y chromosome syndrome, a genetic mutation present in some males in the 22nd century which gives the afflicted individual a predisposition for brutal antisocial behavior such as rape and murder.

50|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Queensland’s railways, freight traffic {{steadily}} declined {{to the point that the}} Winton Branch became uneconomical to maintain. Last patronised in the mid 1990s, the branch closed in 2008. In 2012 it was reported that some 8,500 tonnes of track, 320,000 sleepers and 1.3 million <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> were removed and resold or recycled.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the rubble}} mound {{there are still}} several posts in situ that {{probably}} relate to the railway bin ore bin site. Between there and the buffers are traces of railway sleepers and <b>dog</b> <b>spikes.</b> The latter are found at intervals along the route outlined above. Currently it is a vehicle track that leads towards the fountain. Its actual route is less identifiable as one leaves the mine site.|$|R
50|$|This cartoon's plot {{follows the}} same formula as Tree For Two, except {{that this time}} it's a Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde parody {{as opposed to an}} escaped black panther. Sylvester is trying to escape a pair of <b>dogs</b> (<b>Spike</b> the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier). He accidentally ingests Dr. Jekyll's formula (thinking it's soda pop), causing him to become a monster cat that terrorizes Spike the Bulldog and Chester to call him a coward.|$|R

5000|$|Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulzs first {{publication}} of artwork {{was published by}} Ripley.

5000|$|In 1972, a {{programme}} of rerailing {{the original}} railway began. In that year, 12 km of [...] track and <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> were replaced with [...] track and pandrol clips. The replacement programme continued until its completion in 1977. Hamersley Iron also arranged for test installation of concrete sleepers at various locations from November 1973. The tests were successful, and in 1980 work commenced on the re-sleepering {{of the original}} railway with concrete sleepers, a task completed in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{serviced}} by the rail link from Almaden {{and there is}} limited evidence of the line between Einasleigh railway station and the mine itself. This {{is due to a}} combination of events: removal of the rail track, the construction of an airstrip at some stage west of the mine, frequent grass fires and souveniring of the sleepers. However, a trail of <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> once used to secure the line is discernible along part of the east west access that presently passes the isolated multitubular boiler.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensions}} {{saw another}} progression onto using a slightly larger type of softwood sleeper with the 20lb rail (in 30ft lengths). Initially <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> {{were used for}} the Eleanor’s extension. A trial of using new coach screws and plates to fix the rails to the sleepers was undertaken in September 1988 at Woody Bay, attempting to solve issues with gauge creep and rail joint movement. The trial proved the benefits of this system, with the Haste Hill extension laid entirely with coach screws on pre assembled track panels.|$|R

2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|R
