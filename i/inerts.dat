The effects of liquid axial dispersion and the catalyst wetting efficiency are shown to be negligible.

On both sides of the gas-liquid interface the hydrogen mass transfer coefficient is higher than the corresponding benzene one and both increase significantly with gas velocity.

Another sub-objective that affects the profit in the plant is to improve the control of <b>inerts.</b> In general, the inventory of the <b>inerts</b> is controlled using a purge. A new methodology to optimally control <b>inerts</b> is presented. This methodology aims to reduce the losses that occur throughout the purge by solving an optimization problem to determine the maximum amount of inert that can be handled in the plant without having shut down of the plant due to inert accumulation. The methodology is successfully applied to the Tennessee Eastman Plant where the operating cost was reduced approximately 4 %. This methodology solves an approximation to an optimal economic problem. First, it improves the control performance of key economic variables in the plant. Therefore, tighter control of these economic variables is achieved and the plant can be operated closer to operational constraints. Second, it minimizes purge which is a variable that generally causes significant costs in the plant. This approach is applied to the Tennessee Eastman and the Vinyl Acetate Processes.
