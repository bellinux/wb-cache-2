5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>can.</b> Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} investigations, <b>the</b> {{structural}} changes <b>in</b> proteins were established, which {{were associated with}} the preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by <b>the</b> end of <b>canned</b> food storage duration. Upon sterilization, <b>the</b> losses <b>in</b> protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction in canned foods was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sterilized <b>canned</b> foods, <b>the</b> processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during canned food storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of <b>the</b> pH value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pH value of <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods toward <b>the</b> acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of <b>the</b> shiﬅ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> sour cream sauce. When sterilizing canned foods, another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> sour cream sauce. During storage, the tendency of more intense pH decline was revealed for <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization compared to <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods aﬅer sterilization. Another character of the pH value dynamics was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods <b>in</b> sour cream sauce: an insigniﬁcant increase (by 0. 7 %) of <b>the</b> pH value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pasteurized <b>canned</b> foods and a signiﬁcant decrease (by 8. 4 %) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sterilized <b>canned</b> foods were observed by the end of storage. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies on}} the {{dynamics}} of the redox potential of systems and its relationship with the processes of protein and fat destruction in canned foods during their storage are fragmented and not systemized, which highlight their topicality. The aim of the research was to obtain the experimental data on the Eh values and physico-chemical indicators of canned food quality during storage in order to establish their possible correlation. It was shown that the dynamics of Eh, the content of free amino acids and fatty acid fractions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from beef and pork was different during storage. For example, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eh value and free amino acid content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from beef had a smooth character, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from pork several periods were observed, which differed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character of <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quality indicators. A linear character of <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of fatty acid fractions during storage of <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from beef and pork was noticed. With that, both canned food items had an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saturated fatty acid content at <b>the</b> concomitant decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sum of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The value of an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of saturated fatty acids associated with the process of reduction of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids did not depend on the kind of meat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> foods and was on average 6 %. A decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from pork was about 4 times more intensive compared to <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> products from beef. </p...|$|R

25|$|In this case, it {{may happen}} that the {{hydroxide}} {{formed in the}} first step becomes mechanically detached from the metallic aluminum surface {{and will not be}} transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The initial self-healing process for building a new oxide layer is prevented by a defect or a weak dielectric point, and generated hydrogen gas escapes into the capacitor. Then, at the weak point, further formation of aluminum hydroxide is started, and prevented from converting into stable aluminum oxide. The self-healing of the oxide layer inside the electrolytic capacitor can't take place. However, reactions do not come to a standstill, as more and more hydroxide grows in the pores of the anode foil, and the first reaction step produces more and more hydrogen gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>can,</b> increasing the pressure.|$|E

500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>can</b> by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E

Five replicates of green beans and three replicates of cherries were assayed. Compared to the raw green beans, the blanched green beans were higher in apparent thiamin and lower in ascorbic acid. There was significantly more thiamin and ascorbic acid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pouched green beans and more ascorbic acid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pouched cherries than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canned</b> ones.
