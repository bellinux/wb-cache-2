40|$|Chemical {{potential}} and hardness of Benzidine, 3, 3 - Dimethoxybenzidine, 3, 3 - <b>Dichlorobenzidine,</b> 2, 2, 5, 5 -Tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5,- Pentachlorobiphenyl, Dibenzofuran and adenine, thymine, guanine, cytocin, uracil, GCWC and ATH are calculated through DFT/ 6 - 31 G(d), B 3 LYP method. It is shown that benzidines act as electron donors whereas polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofuran act as electron acceptors during their interaction with biosystems. Motivation. To {{understand the nature}} of charge transfer between a toxin and a biosystem. Method. Calculation of µ, η, PQη and ∆N for several toxins and NA bases and DNA base pairs using B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) method. Results. Benzidines donate electrons to and PCBs,dibenzofuran accepts electrons from a biological system simulated by NA bases and DNA base pairs Conclusions. Benzidine, 3, 3 - Dimethoxybenzidine and 3, 3 - <b>Dichlorobenzidine</b> are electron donors and 2, 2, 5, 5 - Tetrachlorobiphenyl, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5,- Pentachlorobiphenyl, Dibenzofuran are electron acceptors during their interactions with biosystems. Among the toxins benzidine is the best donor and 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 - PCBP is the best acceptor where as among the bases / base pairs guanine is the best acceptor and uracil is the best donor...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{carcinogenesis}} is most advanced in bladder cancer through {{the study of}} what is called aniline bladder cancer. Bladder cancer has also {{played a key role in}} introducing the concept of 'occupational' cancer. Industrial Safety and Health Law defines various chemical substances as carcinogens of 'occupational' cancer, many of which are related to the urinary tract tumor, including benzidine, beta-naphthylamine, alpha-naphthylamine, 4 -aminodiphenyl, 4 -netrodiphenyl, auramine, magenta, orthotolidine, dianisidine, <b>dichlorobenzidine</b> and paradimethylaminoazobenzene. When a patient has been exposed to any of these substances, a diagnosis of 'occupational' cancer is made after consultation in the Central Labor Standards Council. Few bladder cancer patients are acknowledged as victims of 'occupational' cancer. In most cases the cause of bladder cancer remains unknown. However, cases of cancer caused by chemical substances are increasing, and many other chemical substances are probably carcinogenic. Although regulations on 'occupational' cancer have been completed, there are many cases of inconvenience in practice. In this report I investigated into such clinical problems and also studied the above-mentioned carcinogens...|$|E
