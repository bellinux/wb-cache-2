The zoo features the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> red pandas, the barking deer, the snow leopard, the leopard cat, Tibetan wolf, masked palm civet and the spotted deer, amongst the others.

25|$|Nameri National Park - Nameri National Park is in {{the foothills}} of the Eastern Himalayas in the Sonitpur District of Assam. This is {{excellent}} elephant country and was considered to be an elephant reserve. It is an ideal habitat for a host of other animals including the tiger, leopard, sambar, dhole (the Asiatic wild dog), pygmy hog, muntjac, gaur, wild boar, sloth bear, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> capped langur and Indian giant squirrel.|$|E
2500|$|Yaks {{are often}} used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul 100kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and big lungs. One common piece of advice {{for those in the}} Everest region is to be on higher ground when around yaks and other animals, as they can knock people off the {{mountain}} if standing on the downhill edge of a trail. Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr which is sometimes eaten by the snow leopard. The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> can be found up to about [...] and the red panda is also present in the region. One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.|$|E
50|$|Other {{animals that}} {{resided in the}} park also include a chimpanzee, three harbor seals, otters, a rescued caiman croc, two <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears,</b> at least seven sharks, a sea turtle named Tom, flamingos, macaws, toucans, ducks, geese, and {{thousands}} of koi and goldfish.|$|R

6000|$|After {{the monkeys}} came the barasingh, that big deer {{which is like}} our red deer, but stronger. He wished to rub off the velvet of his horns against the cold stones of Kali's statue, and stamped his feet {{when he saw the}} man at the shrine. But Purun Bhagat never moved, and, little by little, the royal stag edged up and nuzzled his shoulder. Purun Bhagat slid one cool hand along the hot antlers, and the touch soothed the fretted beast, who bowed his head, and Purun Bhagat very softly rubbed and ravelled off the velvet. Afterward, the barasingh brought his doe and fawn--gentle things that mumbled on the holy man's blanket--or would come alone at night, his eyes green in the fire-flicker, to take his share of fresh walnuts. At last, the musk-deer, the shyest and almost the {{smallest}} of the deerlets, came, too, her big rabbity ears erect; even brindled, silent mushick-nabha must needs find out what the light in the shrine meant, and drop out her moose-like nose into Purun Bhagat's lap, coming and going with the shadows of the fire. Purun Bhagat called them all [...] "my brothers," [...] and his low call of [...] "Bhai! Bhai!" [...] would draw them from the forest at noon if they were within ear shot. The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> moody and suspicious--Sona, who has the V-shaped white mark under his chin--passed that way more than once; and since the Bhagat showed no fear, Sona showed no anger, but watched him, and came closer, and begged a share of the caresses, and a dole of bread or wild berries. Often, in the still dawns, when the Bhagat would climb to the very crest of the pass to watch the red day walking along the peaks of the snows, he would find Sona shuffling and grunting at his heels, thrusting, a curious fore-paw under fallen trunks, and bringing it away with a WHOOF of impatience; or his early steps would wake Sona where he lay curled up, and the great brute, rising erect, would think to fight, till he heard the Bhagat's voice and knew his best friend.|$|E

They acquired two <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> from a wildlife park in Matlock, and added monkeys, chimpanzees, birds, and reptiles.

50|$|Brown bears usually {{dominate}} other bear {{species in}} areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the <b>black</b> <b>bear's</b> diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, {{as opposed to the}} brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly bears, and especially where found near human habitations, American <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> may become to a larger extent nocturnal. Brown bears may also kill Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears,</b> though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American <b>black</b> species. Brown <b>bears</b> will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Improbably, in the Himalayas, brown bears are reportedly intimidated by Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> in confrontations. However, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the region's Himalayan brown bear, and the latter is one of the smaller races of brown bear, though still somewhat larger than the <b>black</b> <b>bear.</b> In Siberia, the opposite is true, and <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are not known to attack people, but brown <b>bears</b> are. Both <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown bears when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens.|$|R
500|$|Leopards {{are found}} in areas which are {{abundant}} in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears,</b> Indian gray mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, bharal, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants {{can be seen in}} herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) {{are found in}} the rivers.

40|$|We {{conducted}} questionnaire based interviews (n = 1873) {{of respondents}} coming from 258 localities about bear tracts in northern parts of Pakistan in 2012 - 2014 to study Himalyan brown (U. arctos isalbellinus) and <b>Himalayan</b> <b>black</b> (U. t. laniger) bears. Brown bears were more frequent in northern latitudes (northern Chitral, Ghizer, Gilgit and Skardu), while <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> were widely distributed in southern latitudes (Battagram). Both brown and <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> {{are present in}} central latitudes (Astor, Diamir, Kohistan and Mansehra). We identified 34 populations of brown bears; a large population in the Deosai Plateau and small to very small populations in other localities. We identified 9 isolated meta-populations sharing common gene pools; 7 (Bomborat, Gias, Chowgram, Laspur-Malkov, Koshi-Palas, Phunder-Yasin, Khunjerab) very small with serious inbreeding and threat of extinction, while Deosai and Diamir-Astor populations were large but were {{expected to have a}} high level inbreeding. <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> were present in 45 localities; larger populations in three localities of Battagram (Nagram, Rahing and Shamli). We identified 6 meta-populations of black bears; Kohistan-Batagram-Mansehra, Diamir-Astor and south Chitral meta-populations were large; but 3 other populations (Thack, Hisper-Minipin and Chasma) were small/very small, possibly having high inbreeding. Bears raid standing maize crops (regular and severe in 2 localities and irregular and severe in 6) and fruit (apricot, grape, mulberry and walnut). Average annual bears depredation of 54 cattle, 188 goat/sheep, 4 yaks, and 9 horses/donkeys/mules were reported, inflicting an economic loss of Pak Rs. 2, 840, 000 (US$ 28, 400) to the livestock farming community.
