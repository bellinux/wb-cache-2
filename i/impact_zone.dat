40|$|The New York Police Department (NYPD) under Operation Impact {{deployed}} extra {{police officers}} to high crime areas designated as <b>impact</b> <b>zones.</b> Officers were encouraged to conduct investigative stops in these areas. City officials credited the program {{as one of the}} leading causes of New York City's low crime rate. We tested the effects of Operation Impact on reported crimes and arrests from 2004 to 2012 using a difference-in-differences approach. We used Poisson regression models to compare differences in crime and arrest counts before and after census block groups were designated as <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> compared to census block groups in the same NYPD precincts but outside <b>impact</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were significantly associated with reductions in total reported crimes, assaults, burglaries, drug violations, misdemeanor crimes, felony property crimes, robberies, and felony violent crimes. <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were significantly associated with increases in total reported arrests, arrests for burglary, arrests for weapons, arrests for misdemeanor crimes, and arrests for property felony crimes. <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were also significantly associated with increases in investigative stops for suspected crimes, but only the increase in stops made based on probable cause indicators of criminal behaviors were associated with crime reductions. The largest increase in investigative stops in <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> was based on indicators of suspicious behavior that had no measurable effect on crime. The findings suggest that saturating high crime blocks with police helped reduce crime in New York City, but that the bulk of the investigative stops did not {{play an important role in}} the crime reductions.

40|$|This hydrogeophysical field {{experiment}} evaluated {{the ability of}} high frequency (450 & 900 MHz) ground penetrating radar (GPR) to characterize the release of gasoline over an annual cycle of in situ conditions. In August 2008, 200 liters of E 10 gasoline were released into the unconfined sand aquifer at CFB Borden. The 900 MHz profiling clearly shows the development of shallow (i. e., above 10 ns) high reflectivity {{in the vicinity of}} the trench immediately after the release. Additional lateral extension of high reflectivity zone was observed over the following 20 days until the seasonal water table low stand occurred, after which no further lateral movement was observed. Throughout the remainder of the monitoring, the 900 MHz profiling observed a long-term dimming of reflectivity at the periphery of the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> While direct imaging of the shallow <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> by the 450 MHz antennas was significantly obscured by the superposition with the direct air-ground wave arrival; its improved depth of penetration allowed the measurement of a velocity “pull-up” of an underlying stratigraphic interface resulting from the displacement of low velocity water by high velocity gasoline. The maximum pull-up was observed during the water table low stand. The ongoing changes in the pull-up magnitude during the remainder of the observation period suggest the continued redistribution of fluids in the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> Because of the shallow depth of the gasoline <b>impacted</b> <b>zone,</b> the effects of freezing during the winter period were observed in the GPR imaging.

40|$|The {{extent of}} impact damage in {{sandwich}} structures {{depends on the}} core material and the stacking sequence of the sandwich skin laminate, the size, mass and velocity of the impactor and {{on the ability of}} the component to absorb the shock at the impact point. Because of the complex interaction between these parameters the forecast of the damage and the progress under Tension-Tension (T-T), Tension-Compression (T-C) and Compression-Compression (C-C) fatigue loading is difficult to conduct. Impact damage is most critical, when the skin remains intact. Except of a small dent or blister in the skin surface the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> is often barely visible. Nevertheless, the damage may grow under fatigue loading to a critical size, where the component is endangered. In sandwich structures with foam core a delamination will be detected most likely around the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> between skin and core. The damage progress is triggered by the local buckling of the delaminated skin layer. In structures with Honeycomb core delaminations are hardly detected after impact (see Figure 1).

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} attempts to estimate air pollution concentrations using MOVES and site-specific traffic emissions particularly those emissions surrounding three different air-monitoring stations. The objectives {{of this research}} include using MOVES capability to conduct project-level analyses, choosing <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> to create emissions inventories. Emissions inventories provided by the MOVES model for <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> within the El Paso county area were used to identify a relationship between air monitoring stations’ measured results and emission estimates from a project-level analysis. The research hopes to identify an optimum zone radius {{that can be used}} to compare MOVES estimates with air monitoring stations reported data. Air concentration estimations were found using a simple Fixed-Box Model. Modeled emissions were then compared to concentrations from air monitoring stations in El Paso. Air concentrations were found to vary greatly between measured concentrations and the predicted concentrations using MOVES and the Fixed-Box Model. While the correlation is stronger when comparing CO and NOx measured concentrations to observed concentrations, there still appears to be a great discrepancy between values. Measured PM 10 and PM 2. 5 values at air monitoring stations were substantially greater than concentrations measured through MOVES and the box model. This suggests that PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations at these sites can be caused by factors other than and in addition to traffic emissions. Additionally, this research validated emission estimates from the <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> using VMT estimates and comparison to emissions values obtained from previous studies. ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose The {{classification}} step is systematically {{neglected in}} {{the calculation of}} LCIA indicators: for several direct contribution of one pollutant to several impact categories, the distribution between these impact categories is not accounted. The proposed approaches of non-redundant classification {{are based on the}} probability that an emitted substance and its chemically degraded forms are involved into several environmental impacts. Methods Two types of repartitions are examined in this paper: i) one, called equiprobable classification, based on identical probability of contributions to several impact categories, and ii) and one, called zone classification based. Both methods are based on a classification coefficient alpha and require categorization of chemical pathways (reactive, suspensive, direct, indirect). The first method, the equiprobable classification, is a quick method that allows avoiding multiple counting of pollutants. The second method, the zone classification method is based on two steps: i) the first step requires defining an <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> around the source, inside which the emitted chemicals are expected to majorly diffuse or spread; ii) in the second step, the score of the chemical is set according to the occurrence of the chemical target inside the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> Results Both methods are applied on a case study of NOx emissions in Paris. Results highlight big differences (33 % to 47 %) when using or not the classification coefficient. Coefficients calculated using equiprobable or zone classifications are of the same order of magnitude except for indirect contributions. Discussion The zone classification method is compared to other site specific LCA methods. The choices of <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> and of chemical targets are discussed with the aim to meeting paradoxical constraints: local parameters must be sufficiently detailed in the majority of cases, but generic enough to avoid time consuming researches. The availability of data is also discussed as well as the possibility to include indirect impacts into the environmental system. Conclusions The conceptual frame suggested for classification of pollutants into emission-based impact categories, is a first approach for a scientific question that was raised in the 90 's. equiprobable classification is easy to apply but not entirely satisfying from a physical and chemical background. Zone classification relies upon the specificity of emission compartments, and occurrence of chemical targets in the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> It still needs improvements. It has important consequences in terms of data collection, system boundaries, and only practise will show its actual feasibility...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} program between SIMLab and Statoil about impact loads on X 65 offshore pipelines and it is a continuation of previous work. Offshore pipelines are frequently impacted by accidental loads, e. g. trawl gear or anchors. Such loads may cause severe damage to the pipe and a complex stress-strain history locally in the impacted area. Fracture have previously been found in pipes dynamically impacted. Quasi-static bending of similar pipes with the same boundary conditions have been conducted as part of this thesis. The pipes were examined by metallurgical investigation afterwards, but no sign of fracture was found. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the experiments has been carried out to investigate if it is possible to determine fracture by using the Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion. To carry out analyses on a highly refined mesh, it has been investigated if it is possible to utilize a technique known as submodeling. The analyses did not succeed in predicting fracture. Offshore pipelines are often pressurized and this influences the stress-strain history when impacted. As a continuation of previous work it has been conducted quasi-static bending of pressurized and axially loaded pipes. The internal pressure reduced the amount of denting in the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> and increased the stiffness of the pipe with respect to transverse loading. FEA of the experiments has been conducted to investigate if it is possible to recreate the application of internal pressure and horizontal loading. The force-response and deformation of the pipe was found to be described quite well. Horizontal loading had minor importance on the plastic deformation locally in the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> Offshore pipelines are often pressurized and this influences the stress-strain history when impacted.
