5|$|Lafayette was alerted on July 26 that Cornwallis was embarking <b>his</b> <b>troops,</b> but lacked {{intelligence}} about their eventual destination, and began maneuvering <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to cover some possible landing points. On August 6 {{he learned that}} Cornwallis had landed at Yorktown and was fortifying it and Gloucester Point just across the York River.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> in Bavarian territory, {{just north of the}} free and Imperial city of Augsburg. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> toward Augsburg, crossing the Lech River.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of <b>his</b> <b>troops.</b> The number of men wounded and killed had depleted <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

5|$|Buell quickly {{assigned}} Garfield {{the task}} of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through {{the valley of the}} Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to Prestonsburg to reprovision.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, as the {{annexation}} of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area {{in anticipation of}} a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas–Mexico border. The Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846. In May, Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and managed to drive <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> out of Texas. Taylor subsequently led <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> into Mexico, where they once again defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey in September. Defying orders, Taylor moved <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> further south. Despite being severely outnumbered, he dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio López de Santa Anna in February 1847 at the Battle of Buena Vista. After this, most of Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor's popularity remained significant.|$|E
5|$|Learning of the {{annihilation}} of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward {{a company to}} bury the bodies and followed {{with the rest of}} <b>his</b> <b>troops,</b> marching throughout the night of August 19 and finally halting at 04:30 on August 20 within a few miles of the U.S. Marine positions {{on the east side of}} Lunga Point. At this location, he prepared <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to attack the Allied positions that night.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, the Three Leagues {{attacked}} the Habsburg troops that camped again at Glurns on May 22, 1499, before Maximilian could arrive with reinforcements. They overran the fortifications and routed the Austrian {{army in the}} battle of Calven and then ravaged the Vinschgau, before retreating after three days. Maximilian and <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> arrived one week late, on May 29. In revenge, <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> pillaged the Engadin valley, but retreated quickly before reinforcements from the Swiss Confederacy arrived.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Julian was {{acclaimed}} as Augustus (co-emperor) by <b>his</b> <b>troops,</b> but he vehemently {{refused the}} title, which could only legally be bestowed {{by the ruling}} Augustus, Constantius.

5|$|As Philip marched south, {{his opponents}} blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} and Alexander the left, accompanied {{by a group of}} Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|At sunset {{the central}} armies broke contact and withdrew to their {{original}} positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan {{and the failure of}} Vahan's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized, whereas Khalid's successful counterattacks emboldened <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> despite their being smaller in number.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying <b>his</b> <b>troops,</b> and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of <b>his</b> <b>troops</b> were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E
