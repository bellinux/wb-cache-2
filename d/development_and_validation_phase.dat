40|$|Since {{the advent}} of single photon {{emission}} computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) various chemical ligands have been labeled with radionuclides and evaluated as tracer compounds in animal models to ascertain their suitability as potential radiopharmaceuticals for humans. In {{the absence of a}} defined algorithm to predict the diagnostic efficacy of a radiopharmaceutical, any new radioligand has to undergo preclinical evaluation even if it has excellent in vitro properties. Until now few studies have produced pharmacokinetic data that could be translated from animal models directly to humans. The purpose of this review is to highlight some critical aspects to consider during the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phase</b> of a new radiopharmaceutical. Interspecies differences and the absence of knowledge of physiological mechanism can become challenging drawbacks for obtaining a successful radiopharmaceutical. In this context, the influence of ABC transporters in neuroimaging, the effect of plasma protein binding and the consequence of anesthesia with reference to interspecies differences will be discussed with illustrative examples...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} campaign {{investigating the}} postulated Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR) event, in relevant configurations for Heavy Liquid Metal Reactors (HLMRs), {{was carried out}} in the separate-effect facility LIFU 5 /Mod 2, at ENEA CR Brasimone. Ten tests were performed injecting pressurized subcooled water into the reaction tank partially filled by Lead-Bismuth Eutectic alloy (LBE) at 400 Â° C with a cover gas of argon at about 2 bar. Fast pressure transducers, thermocouples and strain gages provided high-quality measurement data for improving the phenomena understanding and supporting the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phase</b> of computer codes for SGTR numerical simulation. The experimental campaign is composed by two series of tests, characterized by different water pressure: 40 and 16 bar. The first two tests belonging to the low pressure experiments are presented, highlighting the pressurization time trends of the water injection tank, injection line and reaction vessel. The injected water mass flow rate and temperature trends in the reaction vessel were measured. The former test is the reference one and the latter was carried out for investigating the injection of water with higher sub-cooling. A post-test analysis of the two mentioned tests was carried out by SIMMER-III code. The pressure profile in the water injection tank was set as boundary condition of the calculation. The numerical analysis provided injection line and reaction tank pressurization in agreement with the experimental data. The lower water temperature test provided a better accordance with the measured data, due to the lower evaporation along the injection line. The SIMMER-III analysis also studied the water-LBE interaction from the volume fraction point of view and the energy released in the total reaction tank and in its cover gas...|$|E

Through the study and analysis of a multinational company of the automotive industry, it was possible to build a framework of study among regions analyzing the test and development operation of engineering organizations at four levels of growth and responsibility. By combining experience and knowledge from leaders and heroes from these regions, with the knowledge and insights from academia and literature; this study is intended to serve as a guide for a testing organization facing the challenge of growing and acquiring greater responsibility. Today's global scenario demand excellence in execution, reducing time and resources in the development of products, being test and development the most resource consuming activities within a generic product development process but at the same time critical and unavoidable. Through a systems engineering approach, the main challenges and improvement opportunities for the development and validation entities at the Ford of Mexico Product Development Organization are documented, with the purpose of creating awareness and proposing the elements fixing a path that would ensure the success for the company as a whole. This path sets the steps for further work in the deployment of a well defined and lean testing system. by Jose Antonio Almazan Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The new {{generation}} Heavy Liquid Metal Reactors (HLMRs) {{are characterized by}} a pool type configuration having high pressure steam generators set inside the reactor vessel. The primary (hot low pressure LBE melt) and secondary (high pressure sub-cooled water) coolant could come into contact as consequence of Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR) phenomenon, that cannot be considered negligible. The structural integrity of the reactor internals, steam generators in particular, could {{be affected by the}} SGTR scenario consequences. The pressure wave propagation, cover gas pressurization, domino effect on the surrounding tubes, reactivity feedback due to steam dragged into the core, primary system pollution and slug formation constitute the most hazardous effects of the SGTR accident. Therefore, this accidental scenario constitutes a safety issue in the design and in the preliminary safety analysis. A key issue in the SGTR analysis for HLMRs is constituted by the availability of qualified experimental data, suitable to be extrapolated to full scale plant and to support the computer code development and demonstrating the code reliability in the phenomena prediction (qualified code). In this paper, part of the experimental campaign performed in the LIFUS 5 /Mod 2 facility at ENEA CR Brasimone (in the frame of the THINS project), investigating the water-LBE interaction, is reported.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{is a powerful}} non-invasive probe to investigate human physiology. A large number of radiotracers have been studied as imaging agents, {{but only a few}} have found clinical applications in phamacology. A potential radiopharmaceutical is designed with very specific physiochemical characteristics, but, generally, less attention is paid to its adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, especially metabolism. Understanding the metabolic fate of radiopharmaceutical probes is essential for an accurate analysis and interpretation of PET measurements. The inherent inability of PET to differentiate between a parent compound and its metabolites confounds the interpretation of images and may impact the identification of the pathologically induced biochemical changes under investigation. Cytochrome P 450 {{plays a major role in}} mammalian xenobiotic biotransformation and many in vitro methods are available to study and predict drug metabolism.

40|$|Introduction: The Mothersâ Object Relations Scale (MORS) was {{developed}} by John M. Oates (Open University, Milton Keynes, UK) in the late 1990 s. The MORS is an appropriate instrument for gathering parental perceptions about {{the child and the}} parent-infant relationship. The questionnaire and its short form were improved further and validated in British and Hungarian samples {{in the beginning of the}} 2000 s and the questionnaire was used in several applied studies in the UK where its predictive validity was further confirmed. Methods: The <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases</b> were based on small samples. The diverse social-demographic characteristics of the For Healthy Offspring project, allowed for further testing the reliability and validity of the Hungarian short-form in a large (n= 1164) sample. Results: High internal consistency was found in the original and the imputed data obtained from parents of 0 â 3 -year old children for both of H-MORS-SF dimensions: Invasion and Warmth. The scales had interpretable and systematic cross-correlations with measures of infant temperament (IBQ-R, ECBQ) and mental state (DS 1 K) of both parents. These results confirm and exceed the previous results based on small samples. Conclusion: Given the convincing psychometric indicators and its fast and simple usage, the H-MORS-SF can be considered as an effective preventive screening test for monitoring the developing parent-infant relationship, therefore we suggest its use for professionals working in developmental psychology, child health and social fields...|$|R

This is particularly true for articles about glomerular disease, which are published across multiple disciplines and are often difficult to track down. Our objective was to develop and test search filters for PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Embase that allow physicians to search within {{a subset of the}} database to retrieve articles relevant to glomerular disease. Methods We used a diagnostic test assessment framework with <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases.</b> We read a total of 22, 992 full text articles for relevance and assigned them to the development or validation set to define the reference standard. We then used combinations of search terms to develop 997, 298 unique glomerular disease filters. Outcome measures for each filter included sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy. We selected optimal sensitive and specific search filters for each database and applied them to the validation set to test performance. Results High performance filters achieved at least 93. 8 % sensitivity and specificity in the development set. Filters optimized for sensitivity reached at least 96. 7 % sensitivity and filters optimized for specificity reached at least 98. 4 % specificity. Performance of these filters was consistent in the <b>validation</b> set <b>and</b> similar among all three databases. Conclusions PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Embase can be filtered for articles relevant to glomerular disease in a reliable manner.

Method: A total of 1675 {{male and female athletes}} ranging in age from 9 to 14 years participated in the AGSYS scale <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases.</b> Items having a readability level of grade 4 (age 9) or below were written and evaluated in a series of studies to assess the reliability, factorial validity, and construct validity of the Mastery and Ego scales. Design: Both correlational and experimental methods were used to assess reliability and validity. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated factorial validity in samples of 9 - 10 -, 11 - 12 -, and 13 - 14 -year-old athletes, and the subscales correlated in a predicted fashion with one another, with other sport and academic goal orientation measures and with several other theoretically relevant variables, including coach-initiated motivational climate, competitive trait anxiety, sport enjoyment, motivation, and self-esteem. Scores also changed significantly in response to a motivational climate coach intervention. Conclusion: The Achievement Goal Scale for Youth Sports (AGSYS) appears to be a reliable and valid measure of achievement goal approach orientations in {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 14 years. We were not successful in developing corresponding avoidance goal orientation scales that were not highly correlated, raising the possibility that children do not cognitively differentiate between mastery-avoidance and ego-avoidance orientations.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that Requirements Engineering (RE) {{has an important}} implication on the overall success of software or system development projects. As more and more organisations consider RE as the principal problem area in projects, improving the RE process therefore becomes critical for future business success. Moreover, nowadays there are evidences highlighting that improvements in RE process maturity can contribute to improved business performance. There exist generic Software Process Improvement (SPI) standards and assessment methods, specialised RE process improvement models as well as guidance and advices on RE. However, they suffer from various issues that limit their adoption by organisations that are interested to assess and improve their RE process capabilities. This thesis proposes a new RE process assessment and improvement approach, which has two main components: a maturity model for RE process and an assessment method. To ease compliance to the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV), the approach was developed based on the de-facto SPI framework. Based on previous researches, the RE maturity model is the first completely and consistently developed model that is provided with detailed, explicit guidance on RE best-practices and targeted for Malaysian software industry. The RE practices were mainly identified through a survey {{on the state of}} RE problems and the practices among local practitioners, and a review of RE textbooks, maturity frameworks and assessment methods. The proposed approach was evaluated and refined twice before it was validated by two sets of local RE and CMMI expert panels. The two-plus-one round of <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases</b> was designed based on a typical threeround Delphi method. To allow higher adoption rate among local practitioners, the approach supports organisations of all sizes to establish RE process improvement initiatives, particularly the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who comprises up to 99 % of the total enterprises in the country...|$|R

40|$|Analytical method {{performances}} {{have to be}} {{specified by}} the analyst trough {{the definition of the}} âAnalytical Target Profile (ATP) â, as proposed by the regulatory bodies. In the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory authorities have recently imposed the assessment and management of risk throughout the entire product lifecycle. This includes the analytical procedure and consequently its own lifecycle. The development step of an analytical method is still largely addressed using a âChanging One Separate Factor a Time (COST) â approach (also known as the âQuality-by-Testing (QbT) â approach). This strategy can lead to a suitable method for assessing the risk of routine use, even where the experimental domain is not examined. However, in order to consider an experimental domain rather than a set of specific experimental conditions during the development phase, a multivariate approach must be considered: the âQuality-by-Design (QbD) â strategy. This strategy allows the definition of a âDesign Space (DS) â by means of design of experiments (DoE). This DS, computed considering critical method parameters, allows the analyst to focus on the main objective of an analytical method: obtaining reliable results using a robust method. In the course of a specific case study, the benefits of the QbD strategy in terms of managing the qualitative part of the analytical process were highlighted. Working in the context of analytical procedure, the validation step is {{a major part of the}} analytical method lifecycle. Indeed, the objective of analytical method validation is to demonstrate that this method is suited for quantifying the target analytes with an established and suitable level of accuracy, as defined by the âATPâ. This is sometimes called the âfit-for-future-purposeâ concept. The decision regarding the validity of a method based on prediction can be achieved by using the âÎ²-expectation tolerance intervalâ (accuracy profile). The capability of this approach to manage the quantitative part of the analytical procedure is nowadays largely illustrated in scientific literatures. Considering the assessment and management of risk throughout the analytical lifecycle, a global strategy allowing the unification of the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases</b> in a single step was considered. With this innovative approach, a strategy allowing the management of global analytical risk (i. e., for both qualitative and quantitative part of the analytical method) was proposed. Indeed, the developed strategy allows validating an entire experimental domain by means of the accuracy profile rather than a single set of specific experimental conditions. With this strategy, the DS is no longer simply the place where qualitative performances are obtained, but also the space where quantitative performances of the analytical procedure are assessed and managed.

40|$|Overview. This project {{examined}} placebo response {{arising from}} clinician beliefs and behaviors through the <b>development</b> (<b>Phase</b> One) <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> (<b>Phase</b> Two) {{of a novel}} measure: the Assessment of Clinician Relationships and Expectations scale (ACRE). The central hypothesis was that clinician beliefs and behaviors, {{as measured by the}} ACRE, would have a significant relationship with patient outcome. ^ Methods. In Phase One, theory-based clinician items and expert-opinion-based site items were developed and evaluated in a series of steps including item sorts, expert panel reviews, a qualitative pre-pilot evaluation, and a pilot investigation. The pilot evaluation tested the a priori factor structure, evaluated item characteristics and scale consistency, and derived an empirically-based factor structure. Phase Two examined the correlation between ACRE scores and outcomes for clinician-patient pairs that were created using three approaches. The first assigned a patient 2 Ì 7 s outcome to a single clinician. The second assigned a patient 2 Ì 7 s outcome to all clinicians contacted. The third assigned a patient 2 Ì 7 s outcome {{based on the number of}} contacts. The ability of ACRE scores to discriminate patient outcome also was evaluated at the clinician, site, and item levels. ^ Results. The a priori factor structure was not supported, but an empirically derived structure that contained four factors named Clinical Beliefs and Behaviors, Research Beliefs and Behaviors, Clinical Patient Beliefs, and Research Patient Beliefs was produced. The derived scale contained 50 items, had acceptable reliability (. 85), and discriminated between sites on scale and factor totals. ^ In Phase Two several hypotheses were tested, but generally not supported. The association between ACRE scores and patient outcome was in the expected direction, but not significant. The scale total was significantly related to Hamilton depression improvement scores, but only for those patients served by clinicians in high versus low ACRE total score groups. ^ Conclusion. Phase One failed to create a fully theory-based scale. Phase Two failed to find a significant relationship between ACRE scores and outcome. Although this study did not clarify the role of the clinician in placebo response generation, it is still believed that a theory-based approach is the best way to gain an understanding of what drives such responses. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} supports {{the choice of}} a Design <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> Research approach for the creation <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> of ID methods, thus providing a theoretically-grounded and pedagogically-inclusive method for designing reusable pedagogical scenarios. It also presents a framework for articulating a generic instructional design theory with a coherent instructional design method, and hence, it contributes to augmenting the instructional design knowledge base. This dissertation presents a research divided into four main <b>phases</b> of <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation.</b> The first <b>phase</b> grounds the research in a theory of instructional design that aligns it with other related design disciplines, and decomposes the design problem into layers of artifact functionalities. This theory corresponds to software-engineering-infused instructional design methods also known as courseware engineering. The second phase explores ways to integrate an educational modeling language within an instructional design method for enabling the representation of pedagogical scenarios of computational facture. To reflect and experiment on this issue, we have chosen to study the MISA instructional design method developed at the LICEF research center and the IMS LD specification. The third phase presents an initial developmental solution, which is tested in a case study. We studied the introduction, into the MISA method, of a new technique supporting the design of a MISA pedagogical scenario according to IMS LD constraints. The aim was to test an 'economic' solution that would not require further modifications to the MISA method. We therefore conducted a case study where a technique for the representation of a conformed to IMS LD pedagogical scenario was applied to the transposition of a MISA pedagogical scenario by an expert instructional designer. The fourth and final <b>phase</b> exends the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> of a solution by way of a two-round Delphi method. We requested the participation of four experts. This developmental step included a selection and introduction of minor modifications of a set of MISA documentation elements identified as crucial for the design of IMS LD compliant pedagogical scenario. The Delphi enabled agreement on an adapted version of the MISA method that fulfills the design purpose. The final outcome of the design process is a pedagogical scenario with all the information required to run an IMS LD-like pedagogical scenario organized in a semi-formal manner and capable of translation into a structured markup language for running in a compliant learning management system. In this sense, the pedagogical scenario results in a document that can be understood as an intermediate state between a blueprint and an executable UoL...|$|R

Results: TDP and the Î³ exhibited significant and consistent values for AD diagnosis in both exploration <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases.</b> TDP had 0. 843 and 0. 837 of the areas under ROC curve (AUCs), 77. 4 % and 81. 5 % of sensitivities, and 78. 1 % and 77. 2 % of specificities respectively in the exploration <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases.</b> The Î³ had 0. 938 and 0. 910 of AUCs, 81. 4 % and 80. 2 % of sensitivities, and 90. 5 % and 87. 2 % of specificities respectively in the exploration <b>and</b> <b>validation</b> <b>phases.</b> TDP <b>and</b> the Î³ can effectively distinguish AD from vascular dementia (64. 3 % for TDP, 67. 1 % for Î³) and frontotemporal dementia (84. 6 % for TDP, 100. 0 % for Î³). Interpretation. The measurement of blood thiamine metabolites by HPLC is an ideal diagnostic test for AD with inexpensive, easy to perform, noninvasive merits...|$|R

The researcher reviews the current available models of speaking performance, analyzes the distinctive features and then points out the implications {{for the development of}} a procedural framework for diagnostic speaking tests. On basis of the overview and the experience gained from the development of Diagnostic College English Speaking Test, The researcher elaborates on the process of the development of the procedural framework. The framework is composed of four major phases: phase 1 needs analysis, phase 2 test design, phase 3 test piloting, administration <b>and</b> <b>validation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>phase</b> 4 test impact. Each phase is further divided into several steps, each having concrete aims and objectives. Literatures relevant to each component of the procedural framework are also recommended by the researcher to help teachers to develop their own diagnostic tests. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research on the development of computerized diagnostic assessment systems...|$|R
