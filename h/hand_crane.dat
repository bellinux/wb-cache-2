50|$|Weed cutting {{boats are}} {{developed}} {{to enable the}} maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by <b>hand,</b> <b>crane,</b> pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation {{may be used for}} the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and {{to make it easier to}} transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed. Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include ensiling the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and fermenting it to produce methane for energy production.|$|E
50|$|Verwood {{station was}} 14 miles and 38 chains from Alderbury Junction, {{some way to}} the west of the village on the B3081. This crossed the line on an over-bridge just to the north of the station. The station {{consisted}} of a passing loop with two platforms plus goods facilities. The up platform was used in both directions when ths signalbox was closed. When the signalbox was open there were two single line sections West Moors to Verwood and Verwood to Fordingbridge, operated by Tylers No 6 tablets, when shut the two token were locked away behind the lever frame (lever 11 was the section locking lever) and a long section staff was withdrawn for a section from West Moors to Fordingbridge. The main station building was a single-storey, double gabled brick building, with platform canopy, on the up platform. Next to it was the LSWR Type 1 signal box and beyond that a parcels store. On the down platform was a timber shelter. At the southern end of the down platform a ground frame was located, this had to be operated for the passage of all down trains when the signalbox was open, it also was required for access to the sidings. In the station yard was the Albion Hotel. The goods yard was at the southern end of the up platform and consisted of a number of sidings, some serving the nearby brick works. A single siding ran between a cattle loading dock and the up platform. Verwood was the only station, other than Fordingbridge, to be equipped with a loading crane. In the later years that the station was open timber for various railway works was forward to the works after being loaded by the <b>hand</b> <b>crane.</b> The Albion Hotel (now the Albion Inn) and the road bridge are the only remaining structures with the road being rerouted across the station site.|$|E
50|$|Quarry men {{worked long}} hours by candlelight with hand {{tools such as}} picks and saws. The quarrymen were also often {{supported}} by child labour. Skilled stonemasons would then work on the stone in the caves because it became harder to carve when exposed to the air. The stone blocks would then be lifted by <b>hand</b> operated <b>cranes</b> after the connection of Lewis lifting devices to be loaded onto horse-drawn wagons. They would then usually be taken to barges which would sail from Beer Beach. After 1540, stone was only quarried for secular building.|$|R
50|$|Under {{cover of}} {{the early hours of}} one Friday morning, a group of volunteers pushed the FJ Holden under the bridge next to the water on the Southern bank of the Torrens. The car was lifted using beams and lifting gear {{attached}} to a small <b>hand</b> operated <b>crane</b> located on the footbridge. The crane, with car attached was then pushed out to the centre of the bridge. The car was then firmly secured to the bridge using a large chain. The crane and volunteers then quickly disappeared into the night and were never found.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} {{problem in the}} boundary layer induced by a continuous moving surface is important in many manufacturing processes in industry such as the boundary layer along material handling conveyers, the aerodynamic extrusion of plastic sheet, the cooling of an infinite metalic plate in a cooling bath (which may also be electrolyte). Glass blowing, continuous casting and spinning of fibres also involve the flow due to a stretching surface. Sakiadis [1] {{was the first to}} study the flow induced by a semi-infinite moving wall in an ambient fluid. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Crane</b> [2] first studied the flow over a linearly stretching sheet in an ambient fluid. Subsequently, Crane [3] also investigated the corresponding heat transfer problem. Since then several authors [4 - 8] have studied various aspects of this problem such as the effects of mass transfer, variable wall temperature, constant heat flux, magnetic field etc. Recently, Andersson [9] has obtained an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the MHD flow over a linearly stretching sheet in an ambient fluid. Also Chiam [10] has studied the heat transfer with variable thermal conductivity on a stretching sheet when the velocities of the sheet and the free stream are equal...|$|E

5000|$|Sheds were {{constructed}} {{on top of}} the main wharves to accommodate goods waiting for export or to be distributed around the town. One shed was built for each of the five berths. The sheds at berths 1-3 were joined together in one continuous line; sheds 4-5 were built as one long structure. In 1938 the Cairns Harbour Board produced a handbook, detailing its activities in the port. This handbook described the wharfage facilities at Cairns as comprising some 1,900 linear feet of reinforced concrete wharves, with six [...] "airy spacious sheds having floor space of 89,020 square feet", as well as the shed for sugar storage. Electric and <b>hand</b> powered <b>cranes</b> were also built {{at the rear of the}} wharves to lift heavy goods onto ships.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the firm goes back to 1820 and a firm {{established}} by Thomas Smith's father David Smith in partnership with Jeremiah Balmforth and based in the nearby area of Calverley. Like several companies operating around Leeds at the time their business was supplying the machinery {{that would be used}} in the increasingly mechanised mills of the time. From 1840 <b>hand</b> operated <b>cranes</b> were added to their range of products and these would start a line of business that would be lucrative for all the partners and their descendants for many years.The company were joined by Jeremiah Booth in 1833, he left in 1847 and established his own 'Union Foundry' on Town Street, Rodley. That company also went on to produce large numbers of cranes and was passed on to Jeremiah Booth's son Joseph Booth in 1855, the name Joseph Booth & Bros was adopted.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 My {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} current scholarship on nineteenth-century American naturalism {{by arguing that}} the emergent theories of determinism and pragmatism were antithetical to, and yet dependent upon, one another. On the one <b>hand,</b> Stephen <b>Crane’s</b> fiction reveals determinism’s heavy weight upon the naturalist genre (the sense that humans cannot affect their worlds), yet unlike Frank Norris or Jack London, for instance, Crane innovatively employs pragmatic elements that work against the very deterministic frameworks that structure his stories. By tracing the dialectic between these theories, I demonstrate how Crane’s fiction not only reveals the destructive relationship between nature and humanity but also, in his pragmatic suspicion of static concepts, the failure of language to accurately interpret {{the world of the}} fin de siècle. My lens provides for more complex interpretations of Crane in addition to Theodore Dreiser in ways that highlight how the deterministic yet pluralistic character of naturalism serves as a bridge between the realist and modernist styles...|$|R
50|$|The LSB overcomes {{limitations}} in width, span, capacity and fatigue that {{is associated with}} many other systems in the RE use The LSB can be built by <b>hand,</b> but where <b>cranes</b> and other mechanical handling equipment are available, they are used to reduces {{the time it takes to}} build and also the number of trained personal needed. Bridge components can be transported using DROPS (NATO) flat racks and ISO shipping containers. The bridge can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Section; when mechanical equipment is used, without it can take up to three sections. Once constructed a LSB tends to remain in situ for far longer periods than either a CSB or a GSB, one bridge in Iraq remained in use for three years. The bridge has a width (roadway) of 4.2m and can be built with sloping or level access ramps depending on the site.|$|R
5000|$|The still-extant {{manuscript}} (since 1821, MS. Malone 12 in {{the collection}} of the Bodleian Library), a small quarto-sized bundle of 48 leaves, is in the <b>hand</b> of Ralph <b>Crane,</b> the professional scribe who worked for the King's Men in this era, and who prepared several texts for the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, as well as two of the surviving manuscripts of Middleton's A Game at Chess, plus other King's Men's works. Since Middleton wrote for the King's Men in this period, the Crane connection is unsurprising. The manuscript bears Middleton's dedication to Thomas Holmes, Esq. There, Middleton refers to the play as [...] "ignorantly ill-fated." [...] This was long taken to mean that the play failed with the audience, but modern critics allow the possibility that the play was pulled from performance for censorship or legal reasons. A 21st century adaptation is available.|$|R
