50|$|The <b>Divi-divi</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} well known species of Libidibia; it is the {{national}} tree of Curaçao. It is also very common and popular on Aruba.|$|E
50|$|Libidibia {{coriaria}} is a leguminous tree {{or large}} shrub {{native to the}} Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. Common names include <b>Divi-divi,</b> Cascalote, Guaracabuya, Guatapana, Nacascol, and Watapana (Aruba).|$|E
50|$|The flora of Curaçao {{differs from}} the typical {{tropical}} island vegetation. Xeric scrublands are common, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs, evergreen, and the watapana tree, called <b>divi-divi</b> on Aruba, characteristic for the ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba.|$|E

50|$|The desert-like (xerophytic) {{vegetation}} of the essentially barren island {{includes a}} number of cactus species such as Cardón de Dato (Ritterocereus griseus), Buche, Melón de Cerro, Sabana o Monte (Melocactus caesius), Guamacho (Pereskia guamacho), and Opuntia tuna {{as well as a}} few legumes (family Fabaceae) such as Mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), <b>Divi-divi</b> (Caesalpinia coriaria), Poorman’s Friend (Stylosanthes viscosa), and the Sangre Drago (Croton flavens).|$|E
5000|$|Divi Divi Air N.V. {{is a small}} {{regional}} service airline in the Curaçao. It was established in 2001 {{and is based on}} Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles, with ticket offices in both Curaçao and Bonaire. In the area its nickname is [...] "e Divi Divi" [...] ("The Divi Divi"). The airline is named for the <b>Divi-divi</b> tree which grows in the region.|$|E
50|$|In this region, {{the flora}} {{includes}} vegetation that grows near the rivers, like the carob tree, the palo verde, salty grama grass, manglar or mangrove tree, the carrizo or giant reed and the Caña brava (ditch reed); and plants that {{grow in the}} hills, such as the Amancay or Peruvian daffodil (Hymenocallis amancaes), the wild tomato, the mito or Peruvian papaya (Vasconcellea candicans), and the <b>divi-divi</b> (Cæsalpinia coriaria).|$|E
50|$|Chistoffelpark {{has more}} {{biodiversity}} than {{elsewhere on the}} island. Flora present in the park includes three pillar cacti species (datu, kadushi, and kadushi di pushi), <b>divi-divi</b> trees and exotic flowers. Cacti in the park reach up to ten feet high, and several extremely rare orchids, such as {{the lady of the}} night and Humboldt's schomburgkia, can be found blooming on them. Plant species occurring only in Christoffelpark include Myrcia curassavica, endemic to Curaçao, and Maytenus versluysii, endemic to Curaçao and Bonaire.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is adapted}} to the dry climate and includes dense deciduous dry forest and thorn forest with cacti, mesquite trees and spiny shrubs.Small patches of seasonal evergreen woodland are found along rivers and on hilltops.The varied microclimates support a variety of types of vegetation including seasonal evergreen lowland forest in the southeast, similar to that found in the Cordillera de la Costa montane forests, dry deciduous lowland forest and submontane forest.The upper slopes and summits of the Sierra San Luis contain dense, medium height cloud forests, with two strata of trees and a dense understory.The dry deciduous forests of the Lara-Falcon hills are fairly open, 8-15 m high, and have dense undergrowth.The main flora are Handroanthus billbergii, Roseodendron chryseum (araguán), Bulnesia arborea (Maracaibo lignum vitae), Bourreria cumanensis, Caesalpinia coriaria (<b>divi-divi),</b> Pereskia guamacho (leafy cactus) and Prosopis juliflora (mesquite).|$|E
50|$|Together with Curaçao and Bonaire, Aruba was {{declared}} an island without use in 1513, {{and two years}} later some 2000 Caquetíos from the three islands combined were transported to Hispaniola to work in mines. These people presumably comprised the entire population of the islands, but 150 to 200 were returned to Aruba and Curaçao in 1526 to work on the exportation of brazilwood, kwihi, and <b>divi-divi.</b> The people returned to Aruba and Curaçao were mainly Caquetíos, but some Arawaks from other Caribbean islands were included in the group. Because of the complexity of the Aruba cave labyrinths, it is possible that they were mostly natives who had escaped deportation, but they could have been recent migrants from the mainland. In addition, substantial mainland-to-Aruba migrations of escapees occurred from 1529 to 1556, during the development of the Venezuelan colony (Haviser, 1991).|$|E
5000|$|Cole Porter and Moss Hart took a four-and-a-half month [...] "around the world" [...] luxury cruise on the Franconia, {{with their}} families, friends, and assistants {{accompanying}} them. Their {{intention was to}} write a new musical on the trip, and songs and scenes were inspired by their ports of call. For example, the song [...] "The Kling-Kling Bird on the <b>Divi-Divi</b> Tree" [...] came about after a trip through a botanical garden in Jamaica. [...] Playing off the recent celebrations in Britain for the silver jubilee of King George V, they created a plot about a royal family, filled with characters based on their famous friends. For example, the swimmer who becomes an actor is a spoof of Johnny Weissmuller, playwright Noël Coward is portrayed as Eric Dare, and the party hostess Elsa Maxwell is portrayed as Eva Standing.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus gattii is an {{emerging}} and primary pathogen. There {{is a lack}} of information about its environmental spread outside outbreak regions in Mediterranean Europe, North and South America. Environmental sampling for C. gattii and molecular characterization of the obtained isolates will provide an insight into the global spread of the various genotypes. METHODS: Woody debris of native <b>divi-divi</b> (Caesalpinia coriaria) trees were sampled across Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Colonies suspected for Cryptococcus species were subjected to standard mycology investigations and identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Isolates identified as C. gattii were subjected to amplified fragment length polymorphism genotyping, mating-type analysis and multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: Ten colonies of C. gattii were cultured from different trunk hollows of the same <b>divi-divi</b> tree. Molecular characterization showed that all isolates were genotype AFLP 6 /VGII and mating-type alpha. Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that all isolates were genetically indistinguishable from each other. CONCLUSIONS: C. gattii is present in the environment of Bonaire, which suggests that this yeast is likely to be present in the environment of other Caribbean islands...|$|E
