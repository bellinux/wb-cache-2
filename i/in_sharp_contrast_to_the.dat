5|$|<b>In</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mostly mild {{weather in}} the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the {{continent}} was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{won by the}} Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6hours, 23minutes, 49seconds, after a six-man {{breakaway}} group contested a sprint finish. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with {{the same time as}} Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (<b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, {{as part of his}} doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E

5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. <b>In</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earl, Fisher was a {{teetotaler}} and a vegetarian, and he hoped {{she would be a}} calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, {{an explanation of}} almost 200 glyphs. His work {{was believed to be}} authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E

25|$|Large {{areas of}} the city centre were rebuilt in the 1950s, when little attempt was made to {{preserve}} Exeter's heritage. Damaged buildings were generally demolished rather than restored, and the street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation.

25|$|In {{spite of}} these criticisms, federal {{government}} support has made abstinence the de facto focus of sex education in the United States, so that opponents frequently adopt the line that abstinence education is acceptable {{only if it is}} combined with other methods, such as instruction in the use of condoms, and easy availability thereof. Most nations of Western Europe use more comprehensive measures, and <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heated discussion in the U.S., abstinence is hardly discussed as an educational measure.|$|E
25|$|Muralitharan {{continued}} to baffle batsman outside {{the shores of}} Sri Lanka, irrespective of the team's performance. In Sri Lanka's humiliating drubbing {{at the hands of}} India in 1993–94, where all three Tests were innings defeats, Muralitharan was the sole success, with 12 wickets in the rubber. His perseverance in the face of some astronomical scores by the fearsome quartet of Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Navjot Sidhu and Vinod Kambli was <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> submission with which his team-mates played the series.|$|E
25|$|The global {{composition}} is highly geometricized, with various planes, angles, layers and facets, as are specific elements depicted on the trompe-l'œil wooden {{table in the}} foreground (as if seen from above).

25|$|By the 20th century, the Asiatic race {{theory and}} its various offshoots were {{abandoned}} but were superseded by two related theories: the eurocentric Hamitic hypothesis, asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing {{with them all}} advanced agriculture, technology and civilization, and the Dynastic race theory, proposing that Mesopotamian invaders {{were responsible for the}} dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC). <b>In</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Asiatic race theory, neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|His country scenes at Yerres {{focus on}} {{pleasure}} boating on the leisurely stream {{as well as}} fishing and swimming, and domestic scenes around his country home. He often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of Renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside, <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flatter, smoother strokes of his urban paintings. In Oarsman in a Top Hat (1877), he effectively manages {{the perspective of a}} passenger {{in the back of a}} row boat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet's Boating (1874).|$|E
25|$|In particular, this norm gets smaller when {{a number}} is multiplied by p, <b>in</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> usual {{absolute}} value (also {{referred to as}} the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred {{back and forth to the}} completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.|$|E
