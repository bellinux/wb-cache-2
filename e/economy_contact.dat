In southeastern British Columbia, community stakeholders formed the Creston log sort yard in 1999, and operated the yard until it was privatized in 2002. This case study summarizes Creston’s experience by discussing conditions {{that contributed to the}} formation, growth, and eventual privatization of the log sort yard. The author presents insights on the viability of such a venture for the benefit of other communities that may be interested in establishing a log sort yard as a strategy for improving the local forestry <b>economy.</b> <b>Contact</b> Informatio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Neuromuscular {{diseases}} (NMD) {{are frequently}} {{characterized by a}} progressive clinical course leading to disability, which has an impact also {{on the quality of}} life. To date, there is no evidence if the severity of disability has a real correlation with NMD patients' satisfaction in the activities of daily living (ADL). The aim of our study was to assess if a correlation exists between life satisfaction and disability in patients with NMD. MATERIALS/PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled adult patients with NMD (age> 18 years) who referred to our unit and who were collaborative to answer to our questionnaires. We evaluated the severity of disability with the ACTIVLIM, a self-reported questionnaire that has been validated in order to quantify the activity limitations of patients with NMD. Concerning patients' life satisfaction, we administered the LiSat- 11, a self-reported questionnaire. Each of the 11 domains is evaluated using a 6 -point scale, dichotomized into 1 - 4 (dissatisfied) and 5 - 6 (satisfied). To calculate the correlation between the ACTIVLIM and the LiSat- 11, we used the Spearman's coefficient, with a significant P value 0. 05). Concerning the median scores of each LiSat domain, only the items regarding life as a whole, <b>economy,</b> <b>contact</b> with friends, ADL, family life and psychological health showed a satisfactory result (median= 5); the domain with the lowest median score was physical health (median= 3). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our study shows that there is no correlation between the severity of disability and the patients' satisfaction in NMD patients, underlining that the effective disability may not correspond to patients' perception of reality and to their needs. Moreover, the social and psychological domains seem to have a higher satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Knowledge {{transfer}} {{contributes to}} innovation and innovation to competitive advantages. Interaction between universities and industry {{is complex and}} lacks research. It is not clear which factors leads to success and what success means. Research argues that the contribution of good relations between partners to effective knowledge transfer and social capital is an important successfactor. This study aims to get more insight in de contribution of social capital to long-term commitment and in the factors leading to social capital. The literature shows the interaction is considered successful if there is satisfaction with the relationship and the results obtained. This satisfaction leads to enter into long-term relationships (long - term commitment). Social capital ensures that the available resources are efficiently shared between the partners. Social capital consists of three forms. Structural social capital creates the links between partners and {{is measured by the}} indicators: invested time, communication, useful resources and coordination. Relational social capital provides access to partners and motivates the partner to exchange knowledge. This form is measured by indicators such as trust, norms and adequate compensation. Cognitive social capital ensures that the partners understand each other's needs, knowledge and abilities. This concept arises from diversity and overlap in knowledge (complementary knowledge), same language, same background and the ability to gather and disseminate knowledge. Furthermore, a number of factors appear to {{contribute to the development of}} social capital. Previous collaboration ensures that the partners know each other, formalization ensures alignment of expectations before starting the process, project management ensures systematic monitoring of the process and students are a bridge between HEIs and companies. They make knowledge more easily available to the companies. During a case study, in the context of Biobased <b>Economy,</b> <b>contact</b> research and three students surveys are examined at an agricultural college and three companies. In order to make the research more reliable and valid, is made use of triangulation. All partners are personally interviewed, because few studies of social capital are based on primary information. The semi-structured interviews were supplemented by observations and research papers. This has delivered both primary and secondary information, with which the complexity of the interaction is visualized. The results show that all the indicators of social capital are present at the contract research, making the interaction successful. It also appears that the factors previous collaboration, formalization and project management contribute to social capital, provided that a number of indicators are present. The student surveys show that not all dimensions are present and there is little social capital. Defects in the project plans, project management and knowledge hinder the interaction. This study shows that high-level knowledge entails risks, which reduces the willingness to share knowledge. Factors such as reciprocity, complementary knowledge, norms, reputation and integrity contribute to readiness. Willingness, communication and complementary knowledge are the most important factors for successful interaction. From the results it is clear that all forms of social capital are powerful tools for knowledge and satisfaction within the interaction. This study is a snapshot, and has some limitations. The research group in which the research was conducted is in the start-up phase, which particularly complementary knowledge shows negative results. Repetition of the study within a few years is recommended for a more reliable picture. More attention to concepts such as absorptive capacity, networking and open innovation will lead in future research to new insights on university-business interactio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact on the Southern Mediterranean Countries (SMC) of the current process of trade {{liberalisation}} with the European Union. The methodology is that of computable general equilibrium modelling under imperfect competition and the model includes 10 countries and 11 sectors. This allows for both a cross-country and cross-sectoral analysis of the results. The experiments considered are the full liberalisation of tariffs, as well as changes in market access and trade induced changes in productivity. A further feature of the paper is that we allow for the phased introduction of tariff reductions as explicitly envisaged in the Agreeements. The results show that the process of liberalisation may have a substantial, though non monotonic, impact on the SMC economies in terms of both changes in production and through this on welfare. The welfare impact is potentially very high in particular for the high tariff economies. The sources of the welfare gain tend to derive from perfectly competitive explanations of trade for the high tariff economies, and from imperfectly competitive explanations of trade for the low tariff <b>economies.</b> <b>Contact...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to describe}} the buildings, landscape, population and economy of the township of Swettenham between the years 1660 and 1770 using mainly the primary sources available. Firstly there is {{a description of the}} landscape and population in general terms - the landscape's appearance, land use, pattern of settlement, overall population trends and patterns. This includes consideration of how old the landscape described might be. Moving away from the general to the particular, consideration is then given to the standards of living and way of life of the individuals, the type of agriculture they practised and the buildings in which they lived. Where possible, reference is made to evidence from the lives of individuals to support and illustrate these themes.

50|$|McLaren {{work during}} the past several decades {{is not so much a}} break from his early work, as an {{extension}} of it. A discernible shift occurred in the sense that he now focuses more on a critique of political economy. But his early work also included a critique of capitalism, except during that time McLaren operated from primarilya Weberian understanding of class and was concerned at that time with the politics of consumption and lifestyle/identity. McLaren’s new turn saw him focus on the social relations of production and its relation to the production of subjectivity and protagonist agency. Between 1994 up to the present, McLaren’s work is less directed at the classroom per se, and more focused on issues such as a critique of political <b>economy,</b> cultural <b>contact</b> and racial identity, anti-racist/multicultural education, the politics of white supremacy, resistance and popular culture; the formation of subjectivity, the coloniality of power and decolonial education; revolutionary critical pedagogy informed by a Marxist humanist analysis and liberation theology.|$|R
5000|$|Afghan-American {{relations}} became important {{during the}} start of the Cold War, between the United States and Soviet Union. Prince Mohammed Naim, King Zahir Shah's cousin, became the Chargé d'affaires in Washington, D.C. At that time, U.S. President Harry S. Truman commented that the friendship between the two countries would be [...] "preserved and strengthened" [...] by the presence of senior diplomats in each capital. The first official Afghanistan Ambassador to the United States was Habibullah Khan Tarzi, who served until 1953. The U.S. Kabul Legation was elevated to the U.S. Embassy Kabul on May 6, 1948. Louis Goethe Dreyfus, who previously served as Minister Plenipotentiary, became the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1949 to 1951. The first American expedition to Afghanistan was led by Louis Dupree, Walter Fairservis, and Henry Hart. In 1953, Richard Nixon who was serving as U.S. Vice President at the time made an official diplomatic visit to Kabul. He also took a short tour around the city and met with local Afghans.In 1958, Prime Minister Daoud Khan became the first Afghan to speak before the United States Congress in Washington, DC. His presentation focused on a number of issues, but most importantly, underscored the importance of US-Afghan relations. While in the US capital of Washington, Daoud met with President Dwight Eisenhower, signed an important cultural exchange agreement, and reaffirmed personal relations with Vice President Nixon that had begun during the latter's trip to Kabul in 1953. The Prime Minister also traveled around the United States visiting the New York Stock Exchange, the Empire State Building, hydroelectric facilities at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and other sites.At that time the United States declined Afghanistan's request for defense cooperation but extended an economic assistance program focused on the development of Afghanistan's physical infrastructure—roads, dams, and power plants. Later, US aid shifted from infrastructure projects to technical assistance programs to help develop the skills needed to build a modern <b>economy.</b> <b>Contacts</b> between the United States and Afghanistan increased during the 1950s, especially during the Cuban Revolution between 1953 and 1959. While the Soviet Union was supporting Cuba's Fidel Castro, the United States was focusing on Afghanistan for its strategic purposes. This was mainly to counter the spread of communism and the strength of the Soviet Union into South Asia, particularly the Persian Gulf.|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{species have}} {{played a central role}} in the emergence, re-emergence and {{maintenance}} of major zoonotic diseases that pose serious threats to public health worldwide. These zoonoses are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The human immunodeficiency virus alone infects 33. 3 million people worldwide, causing 1. 8 million deaths and 1. 9 million new cases in sub-Saharan Africa yearly. Human-wildlife contacts that result in zoonotic disease transmission include; the consumption of bushmeat, live wildlife trade, hunting and visits to game reserves. Despite the benefits derived from wildlife by several nations especially in the provision of animal protein requirements and the development of national <b>economies,</b> these <b>contacts</b> expose the public globally to the risk of zoonoses from wildlife reservoirs. Tackling these problems requires educating the public of the risk of zoonoses and the possible ways of contracting them from wildlife, vaccination of humans and wildlife against vaccinable zoonoses, wildlife disease surveillance, veterinary inspection of bushmeat before consumption, enforcement of regulations relating to wildlife disease management, fertility control and culling.

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} {{job search}} through personal contacts into an equilibrium matching {{model with a}} segregated labour market. Job search in the public submarket is competitive which is {{in contrast with the}} bargaining nature of wages in the informal job market. Moreover, the social capital of unemployed workers is endogenous depending on the employment status of their contacts. This paper shows that the traditional Hosios (1990) condition continues to hold in an <b>economy</b> with family <b>contacts</b> but it fails to provide efficiency in an economy with weak ties. This inefficiency is explained by a network externality: weak ties yield higher wages in the informal submarket than family contacts. Furthermore, the spillovers between the two submarkets imply that wage premiums associated with personal contacts lead to higher wages paid to unemployed workers with low social capital but the probability to find a job for those workers is below the optimal level. ...|$|R
40|$|Caribbean Nicaragua {{has its own}} {{cultural}} logic that helps to explain the eating habits of indigenous communities that rely on sea turtle meat for nutrition and prefer its taste {{to that of other}} available meats. Nutritional costs and benefits form a fundamental part of this reliance, yet there are ecological, economic, cultural, and other factors that may be just as if not more important than the nutritional value of turtle meat. Caribbean Nicaraguans have legally harvested green turtles (Chelonia mydas) for more than 400 years, and continue to rely on the species as an inexpensive and tasty source of protein and income. From 1967 to 1977, green turtles were harvested for both local and foreign consumption, including annual exports to the US and Europe from turtle packing plants in Nicaragua in excess of 10, 000 turtles. Although the processing plants have been closed for over 30 years after Nicaragua became a signatory of CITES in 1977, the local demand for turtle meat in coastal communities has continued. Following themes of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology, we first discuss what is known about the traditional culture of Caribbean Nicaragua, in particular the history of its changing <b>economy</b> (after European <b>contact</b> and settlement on the coast) and subsistence lifestyle of Miskito and Creole societies on the coast. Second, we provide background information on regional ethnic identity and the human ecology of the Caribbean Nicaragua sea turtle fishery. We then present a quantitative analysis of the relationship between protein preference and various demographic characteristics, and speculate whether protein preferences have been altered in the coastal culture, providing recommendations for future research. Recent studies present disparate views on whether nesting and foraging green turtle populations are increasing or decreasing in the region: in either case the level of harvest makes the topic of protein preference an important and relevant consideration in conservation...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{addresses}} {{these issues}} in a sociological microcosm that makes questions about population aging particularly interesting. The group on whom we report are the Ju| 2 ̆ 7 hoansi (!Kung) of western Ngamiland, part of the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. They constitute a noteworthy case for several reasons. Discussion of modernization {{and its impact on}} the lives of elderly in traditional society has focused most often on agricultural and peasant societies, rather than on economically simpler groups such as hunter gatherers 1). Ju| 2 ̆ 7 hoansi, though now living in permanent settlements, have a recent past of mobile hunting and gathering. Over the past sixty years, Ju| 2 ̆ 7 hoansi have experienced serious social disruption, a fact far from unique in less developed parts of the world. However, in the case of the Ju| 2 ̆ 7 hoansi, during this period of change anthropological reports and research have accumulated, making it possible to make comparisons of 2 ̆ 2 before 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 after 2 ̆ 2 concerning aspects of old people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. In this paper we compare changes in adult longevity measured at two time intervals, 1968 and 1988, and ask, 2 ̆ 2 Has sedentism and population aggregation improved or worsened chances for a long life? 2 ̆ 2 Although life tables and census age distributions are not available from official sources for this remote area, the authors compare changes in the co-survivorship of adult children and their parents at the two intervals.

First, it describes {{the importance of}} global cities in the economy, particularly those competiveness factors, which are originated from spatial concentration, which can be implemented in the development strategy, or considering the negative externalities, which should be avoided or at least handle them to reach sustainability. In the next phase we describe the various methodologies applied for measuring competitiveness. The third {{part of the study}} covers the detailed description of the Asian global cities' competitive characteristics. We focus on the globalization, the economics growth and competitiveness; we also mention key factors, like tourism. Considering history cities have always played a determining role in the economy of a country, so do they in nowadays society. The world population in cities keeps on growing, the metropolis areas have become the centers of innovation and development, that is why their analysis is appropriate. Regional economics has been dealing with the question of cities for a long time, which has become an emphasized research field. The focus is on the spatial concentration, their integrated economy, the capital and the information. In our century a determining part of the population is townsman, where the service sector is dominant. The concentration of consumer - and labor market can be experienced in megacities: the local extern effects generate economic advantages, while the transportation costs shrink. The competition between cities has become fierce: the biggest cities try to attract transnational companies and FDI. A complex analysis of the cities' competitiveness contributes to the establishment of economic, social and environmental sustainability. As there is a pattern of global cities the network of cities has divided into two parts: the global cities spatial relations are integrated into the world <b>economy</b> and loose <b>contact</b> with the local and traditional smaller cities in their region. The smaller cities tend to be smaller, they are out of the economic circulation, and they are endangered by depletion. This road leads to social and economic inequality, the differences between the cities {{in and out of the}} global network grows dramatically. The goal of our study is to describe the various methodologies applied for measuring competitiveness, and to bring awareness to the challenges of the near-future caused by the developing, emerging Asian cities...|$|R
