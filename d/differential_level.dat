50|$|This {{region has}} been shown to aid in the {{production}} of Somatostatin and research shows that neurons releasing somatostatin are stimulated to do so by gluatamergic innervation and then this allows them to stimulate the release of growth hormone. There is thought to be a <b>differential</b> <b>level</b> of secretion of somatostatin between males and females by the periventricular nucleus and that is thought to be responsible for the sexual dimorphism of growth hormone secretion. It has also been suggested that leptin secretion also plays a role in the release of GH from periventricular nucleus and that this hormone interacts with both somatostain and Growth Hormore Releasing Hormone (GHRH) in the GH release pathway. This is further supported by the presence of leptin receptors in neurons of the periventricular nucleus. GH may also be able to provide regulatory feedback on the periventricular nucleus by increasing cytochine signaling to the hypothalamus which inhibits the GH release pathway.|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease, characterised by a progressive cognitive and memory decline. From a neuropathological point of view, Alzheimer disease {{is defined by the}} presence of characteristic lesions, i. e. mature senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid angiopathy. In particular, accumulation of the amyloid beta-peptide in the brain parenchyma and vasculature is an invariant event in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial Alzheimer cases. Amyloid beta-peptide originates from a larger precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitously expressed. Among the different peripheral cells expressing APP forms, platelets are particularly interesting since they show concentrations of its isoforms equivalent to those found in brain. Moreover, a number of laboratories independently described alterations in APP metabolism/concentration in platelets of Alzheimer patients when compared to control subjects matched for demographic characteristics. These observations defined the frame of our work aimed to investigate if a correlation between levels of platelet APP forms and Alzheimer disease could be detected. We have reported that patients affected by Alzheimer disease show a <b>differential</b> <b>level</b> of platelet APP forms. This observation has several implications: APP processing abnormalities, believed to be a very early change in Alzheimer disease in neuronal compartment, do occur in extraneuronal tissues, such as platelets, thus, suggesting that Alzheimer {{disease is a}} systemic disorder; further, our data strongly indicate that a <b>differential</b> <b>level</b> of platelet APP isoforms can be considered a potential peripheral marker of Alzheimer disease allowing for discrimination between Alzheimer and other types of dementia...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Translational {{control of}} gene {{expression}} {{has emerged as}} a major mechanism that regulates many biological processes and shows dysregulation in human diseases including cancer. When studying <b>differential</b> translation, <b>levels</b> of both actively translating mRNAs and total cytosolic mRNAs are obtained where the latter is used to correct for a possible contribution of <b>differential</b> cytosolic mRNA <b>levels</b> to the observed <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of actively translated mRNAs. We have recently shown that analysis of partial variance (APV) corrects for cytosolic mRNA levels more effectively than the commonly applied log ratio approach. APV provides a high degree of specificity and sensitivity for detecting biologically meaningful translation changes, especially when combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating random error. Here we describe the anota (analysis of translational activity) R-package which implements APV, allows scrutiny of associated statistical assumptions and provides biologically motivated filters for analysis of genome wide datasets. Although the package was developed for analysis of differential translation in polysome microarray or ribosome-profiling datasets, any high-dimensional data that result in paired controls, such as RNP immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-CHIP) datasets, can be successfully analyzed with anota...|$|R

Differentiation of appropriate numbers of each hormone-expressing endocrine cell type {{is essential for the}} normal development of the pancreas and ultimately for effective maintenance of blood glucose levels. A fuller understanding of the details of endocrine cell differentiation may contribute to development of cell replacement therapies to treat diabetes. In this study, by using morpholino and gRNA/Cas 9 mediated knockdown we establish that <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of the basic-helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor Neurod are required for the differentiation of distinct endocrine cell types in developing zebrafish. While Neurod plays a role in the differentiation of all endocrine cells, we find that differentiation of glucagon-expressing alpha cells is disrupted by a minor reduction in Neurod levels, whereas differentiation of insulin-expressing beta cells is less sensitive to Neurod depletion. The endocrine cells that arise during embryonic stages to produce the primary islet, and those that arise subsequently during larval stages from the intra-pancreatic duct (IPD) to ultimately contribute to the secondary islets, show similar dependence on <b>differential</b> Neurod <b>levels.</b> Intriguingly, Neurod-deficiency triggers premature formation of endocrine precursors from the IPD during early larval stages. However, the Neurod-deficient endocrine precursors fail to differentiate appropriately, and the larvae are unable to maintain normal glucose <b>levels.</b> In summary, <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of Neurod are required to generate endocrine pancreas subtypes from precursors during both embryonic and larval stages, and Neurod function is in turn critical to endocrine function...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates three {{hypotheses}} {{in relation}} to the cognitive explanation of normal and problematic gambling behaviour. The "strong cognitive hypothesis" takes the view that if cognitive processes alone account for different levels of play, then the order of the events experienced during a task may be a good predictor of the levels of play. Four large scale experiments are presented focusing on the Illusion of Control, particularly the order effects originally observed by Langer and Roth (1975). Drawing on Hogarth and Einhom's (1992) belief adjustment model an adjusted methodology is employed making the paradigm resemble the real gambling decision making task more closely. The results of the Illusion of Control experiments suggest that the strong cognitive hypothesis can account for gambling in general, but there is no consistent support in favour of its role in explaining <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of play. Three questiormaire studies are then presented investigating the two alternative hypotheses assessed in this thesis. The "weak cognitive hypothesis" stipulates that an additional individual differences element is necessary to supplement the strong cognitive hypothesis in order to explain <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of gambling behaviour. Individual differences in the level of everyday general dissociation, the enjoyment and engagement in two forms of processing (Rational or Experiential, Epstein 1990), and in the extent to which heuristics and biases are used when making decisions are investigated. Factor analysis for the heuristics and biases investigation, particularly {{in relation to}} the understanding of the principle of randomness, reveals some evidence for the weak cogmtive hypothesis. Strongest evidence emerges {{in relation to the}} "integrative hypothesis" which stipulates that cognitive factors and processes are only important in relation to and interaction with other variables. The questioimaire studies investigate the role of erroneous beliefs and their relationship with the dissociation experienced within the gambling task. Using Structural Equation Modelling techniques, the results lead towards the generation of a new model of <b>differential</b> <b>levels</b> of gambling and the causal links between these variables and the loss of control are discussed...|$|R
