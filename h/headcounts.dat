40|$|The most elementary, {{and also}} the most widely employed, means of {{assessing}} the extent of poverty in any society is to obtain a simple <b>headcount</b> of the poor. The poor are those whose incomes fall short of a stipulated poverty line. The commonest measure of poverty is the <b>headcount</b> ratio, H, which is {{the proportion of the}} poor in the total population. An alternative, and far less routinely used <b>headcount</b> index, is the aggregate <b>headcount,</b> A, which is the total absolute number of the poor. A problem for the measurement of poverty – and one which is only rarely acknowledged by professional economists – is that the <b>headcount</b> ratio and the aggregate <b>headcount</b> can provide contrary poverty rankings. For example, if in some initial time period 30 persons in a population of 100 are poor, while in a later time period 40 persons in a population of 200 are poor, then the <b>headcount</b> ratio declines from 30 per cent to 20 per cent, whereas the aggregate <b>headcount</b> rises from 30 persons to 40 persons. This type of proble...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{measuring}} and reporting poverty is the <b>headcount</b> ratio, given as {{the percentage of}} population that is below the poverty line. For example, The New York Times in July 2012 reported the poverty <b>headcount</b> ratio as 11.1% of American population in 1973, 15.2% in 1983 and 11.3% in year 2000. One of the undesirable features of the <b>headcount</b> ratio is that it ignores the depth of poverty; if the poor become poorer, the <b>headcount</b> index does not change.|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical evidence on recent trends in poverty among working families {{based on the}} <b>headcount</b> rate and a broader alternative that incorporates the <b>headcount</b> rate, the depth of poverty, and income inequality among the poor. Estimates reveal that the indexes produce significantly different trends. The <b>headcount</b> rate indicates a reduction in overall working poverty for the sample period, while the alternative index showed no statistically significant change. The same result was found for various population subgroups. Decompositions of the index changes show that tax changes contributed to lower values for both the <b>headcount</b> rate and the alternative index, largely due to recent expansions of {{the earned income tax}} credit. Changes in transfer payments added to measured poverty, mirroring the retrenchment of welfare and other transfer programs. Shifts in market-based income decreased both indexes. Poverty...|$|R
