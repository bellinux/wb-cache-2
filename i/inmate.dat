40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to apply the concepts of voluntary association to a population of female <b>inmates.</b> This research examined voluntary associations among female <b>inmates</b> and sought an understanding {{of the extent to which}} the female <b>inmates</b> affiliated with associations, and the specific types of association <b>inmates</b> join. More importantly, this study explored whether or not <b>inmates</b> 2 ̆ 7 membership in voluntary associations significantly affected <b>inmates</b> 2 ̆ 7 alienation. Systematic research in this area has not been done. ^ A sample of female <b>inmates</b> incarcerated at the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Reformatory, York, Nebraska, were interviewed for this research. It was shown that the <b>inmates</b> did, in fact, join various voluntary associations and they were more likely to join instrumental type associations. It was demonstrated that <b>inmates</b> 2 ̆ 7 levels of alienation were slightly reduced by affiliation in voluntary associations. Moreover, the <b>inmates</b> were more likely to join voluntary associations that were highly ranked by the staff and <b>inmates</b> themselves. ^ The results indicated the important role voluntary association membership plays in the lives of <b>inmates.</b> However, at the time of the study, the institution was in a state of flux and this resulted in fewer voluntary association memberships in the institution. Furthermore, at the time of the study, there were only 37 female <b>inmates</b> in the prison. As such, the present investigation provides important leads for future research on the voluntary association membership of female <b>inmates.</b> ...|$|R
