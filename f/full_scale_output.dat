Reduction of power consumption in these device {{can be achieved by}} moving towards smaller feature size processes.

In order to achieve a large dynamic range with an ultrahigh resolution, the capacitive detection system employs two periodic-sensing-array transducers. Each of them can provide numbers for the signal period in the entire operating range. The suspended proof-mass is encapsulated between two glass caps, which results in a three dimensional structure.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in prosthetic socket design have created {{renewed interest in}} monitoring the stress distribution at the socket-residual limb interface. Although a few devices for measuring pressure {{can be found in}} the literature, none are capable of measuring reliably in areas of high curvature, such as the important area at the patellar tendon bar. Furthermore, few devices can record shear stress, thought to be critical in causing tissue damage. In order to address these issues two new transducers have been designed and evaluated. One design allows the simultaneous recording of the normal and shear stresses at various points of the socket walls, while the other is capable of measuring the three components of the force applied on the patellar tendon. The latter design incorporates a feature that permits displacement of the patellar tendon bar, in order to study the effect of various amounts of indentation of the tendon on the stress distribution around the residual limb. Both transducers were calibrated using dead weights and special jigs to ensure accurate loading conditions. Under laboratory bench conditions the normal-shear force transducer showed: 2. 03 per cent <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>output</b> (FSO) hysteresis error for shear stress direction, 1. 65 per cent FSO for normal direction; 99. 56 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and within 99. 64 per cent FSO for normal direction; and for the patellar tendon transducer 1. 53 per cent FSO hysteresis error for shear direction, 1. 85 per cent FSO for shear stress direction; 99. 65 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and 99. 58 per cent FSO for normal direction.

40|$|The human tactile system, {{with its}} {{specialised}} mechanoreceptors, {{is capable of}} dexterous manipulation and exploration. In contrast, state-of-the-art robotic systems, lack this ability due to inadequate tactile feedback. Likewise, tactile sensors developed to-date lack appropriate flexibility, multi-axial detection, sensitivity, dynamic range and frequency response. Therefore, this thesis aims to address these limitations by developing a tactile sensor using flexible electronics and nanomaterials. Cross-linked gold-thiol nanoparticle (NP) films were fabricated using inkjet printing, demonstrating patterning of features down to 30 µm. Bridge and cantilever-based normal force NP film sensors were fabricated on flexible and rigid substrates to achieve sensitivities of around 0. 3 %/mN and 0. 001 %/mN respectively. A novel multi-axial sensor was fabricated using soft-lithography with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer mesa, a PDMS-polyimide (PI) substrate, and four NP film sensing elements. The mesa mimicked the epidermal ridges on the skin, localised the force onto the sensing elements and allowed high sensitivity detection of shear (0. 037 %/mN, 0. 036 %/mN) and normal forces (0. 048 %/mN). To reduce the wiring and enable addressing of NP film sensors, two types of flexible low-voltage organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were developed based on ion-gel and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) high capacitance dielectrics. SAM devices showed mobilities of ~ 0. 9 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1, I_on/off ratios of 10 ^ 6 and cut-off frequencies at 1 kHz. Conversely, ion-gel devices showed mobilities of ~ 4 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1 and I_on/off ratios of 10 ^ 4, but a low cut-off frequency (~ 1 Hz) in its response due to the ions from the gel doping the semiconductor. A one-dimensional normal pressure sensing array was also developed, with an unstructured and structured PDMS layer under the deforming NP film. Sensors with structured PDMS exhibited sensitivities of up to 0. 5 %/kPa, while sensors with unstructured PDMS had a dynamic range of 0 - 300 kPa and mechanical crosstalk as low as 4 % of its <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>output</b> (FSO).
