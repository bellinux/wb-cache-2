500|$|A general {{difficulty}} with {{the application of the}} model, like many game theoretic models, {{is that it does not}} easily lend itself to econometric testing and parameter estimation. As a result, the two avenues of empirical research that have been pursued in subsequent literature have been estimates of a [...] "conjectural variation" [...] parameter for particular industries, and calibration of the models using behavioral parameters from other studies. The former approach assumes that firms have a [...] "conjecture" [...] as to how the other firms will react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an <b>export</b> <b>subsidy)</b> nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax). As a result, it is hard to say in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.|$|E

40|$|We explore in {{this paper}} the role of <b>export</b> <b>subsidies</b> when goods {{arriving}} from foreign countries are initially of unknown quality to domestic consumers, who learn about their quality only through consumption. If, when confronted with such goods, consumers view price as a signal of quality, a role for <b>export</b> <b>subsidies</b> can arise. In particular, we show that absent <b>export</b> <b>subsidies,</b> entry of high quality firms may be blocked by their inability to sell at prices reflecting their true quality. <b>Export</b> <b>subsidies</b> enable high quality producers to begin exporting profitably even while unable to credibly convey their high quality to consumers in the "introductory" period. Thus, in breaking the entry barrier for high quality firms, <b>export</b> <b>subsidies</b> can raise average quality {{in the market and}} a welfare-improving role for <b>export</b> <b>subsidies</b> emerges. Moreover, even when high quality firms find it possible to signal their high quality to consumers through an introductory pricing strategy, a role for government policy can arise: the signal (low introductory price) represents a transfer of surplus from foreign producers to domestic consumers which, as we show below, can be avoided with an appropriate export tax/subsidy policy. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} model {{is set up}} as a two-stage game. In the initial stage, the home government is able to enact an <b>export</b> <b>subsidy</b> for the home firm’s output of the homogenous product. In the second stage, the firm of each country chooses the quantity to produce and sell to the third country. Each firm takes the other’s output as given when maximizing profit. The subsidy lowers the home firm’s cost and makes it want to export more for any given export level of the rival. Since the home and foreign products are strategic substitutes, the foreign firm must reduce its output. As the domestic <b>export</b> <b>subsidy</b> increases, aggregate quantity rises, price falls, and the profits of the domestic firm rise while foreign profits decline. In effect, rents are shifted from the foreign firm to the home firm.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{theories}} of trade agreements suggest that GATT/WTO e¤orts to reign in <b>export</b> <b>subsidies</b> represent an ine ¢ cient victory for exporting governments that {{comes at the}} expense of importing governments.
