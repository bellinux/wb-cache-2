40|$|Abstract. The paper {{addresses}} a {{park and ride}} network design problem in a bi-model transport network in a multi-objective decision making framework. A goal programming approach is adopted to solve the multi-objective park and ride network design problem. The goal programming approach considers the user-defined goals and priority structure, which are (i) traffic-efficient goal, (ii) total transit usage goal, (iii) spatial equity goal. This problem is formulated as a bi-level programming model. The upper level programming leads to minimize the <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>stated</b> goals {{in the context of}} a given priority ranking. While the lower level programming model is a modal split/traffic assignment model which is used to assess any given park and ride scheme.

Scaling {{is based on the}} assumption that standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the length of the time interval of the sample (for example daily, monthly or annual data). We analyze the cases when this assumption is justified, and emphasize possible weaknesses of this procedure. As an example, we test the assumptions of scaling on three market indices: Slovak SAX, Czech PX- 50 and the S&P 500 index. We conclude that in case of Czech and Slovak index we find significant <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>stated</b> assumptions. Hence, contrary to the common practice, time-series scaling cannot be used on all time series and requires prior careful examination of the analyzed data. asset returns; normal distribution; white-noise process; random walk...|$|R

The CAT bond so designed is priced using state-level historical yields for peanut production {{in the southern part of}} the United States in the State of Georgia. The index triggering the CAT bond contract was based on percent <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> average yield. The principal finding of the study is that it appears feasible for crop insurance purveyors to issue insurance-linked securities. CAT bonds can reduce the variance of the loss ratio when issued optimally with regard to the number of bonds and contract specifications. CAT bonds could therefore be used in hedging catastrophic risk effectively in peanut production given that crop insurance purveyors normally seek to minimize the variance of the loss ratio. CAT bonds were found to be feasible as hedging instruments even in the range of normal losses commonly covered by crop insurance and reinsurance.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the road toll pricing and capacity investment {{problem in a}} congested road network in a multicriteria decisionmaking framework. A goal programming approach is used in which the following four major goals are considered: (1) cost recovery, (2) service level, (3) environmental, and (4) equity. The multiobjective road toll pricing and capacity investment problem is formulated as a bilevel goal programming model. The upper level of the model aims to minimize the <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>stated</b> goals for a given priority ranking of the goals, while the lower level is the road users' route choice equilibrium problem. A simulated annealing-based solution algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model.

The simulated annealing-based solution algorithm outperforms the sensitivity analysis-based solution algorithm in terms of solution quality.

In sensorless drives, voltage <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> steady <b>state</b> are used in the case the back-EMF is too low to obtain an accurate rotor position estimation. The voltage deviation applied, generates a measurable current ripple from which an estimation of the rotor position can be made. To study the dynamic behaviour of the current controller as well as the accuracy of the position estimator, the current response on voltage <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> steady <b>state</b> is of importance.

This paper discusses a strategy to measure the current dependence of the machine impedance.

To verify the method, experimental identification of the machine impedance is conducted on a permanent-magnet machine of 3. 7 kW supplied by using a voltage-source inverter (VSI) with IGBTs. A second set of experiments is performed on a synchronous machine of 150 kVA with rotor field winding for which the stator is supplied by using a full-bridge thyristor rectifier (FBR). The generation of voltage signals is discussed here for the VSI as well as the FBR as these converters are often used for the power convertion in synchronous drives...|$|R
