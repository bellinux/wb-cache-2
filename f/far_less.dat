5|$|Although <b>far</b> <b>less</b> {{common than}} other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces.

5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders.
