40|$|We {{describe}} a new suction tube for microsurgical procedures which permit a precise {{control of the}} pressure of suction. The new device consists of a suction tube connected to a laterally placed <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which progressively opens or closes a leak. The surgeon can readily adjust the suction pressure by moving slightly the <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> with his thumb or index!nger up and down almost instantaneously...|$|R

50|$|Able bodied passengers, {{selected}} {{and used by}} flight attendants to assist in an evacuation, typically by remaining {{at the bottom of}} the <b>escape</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
30|$|Components of {{configuration}} panel are as follows: sensing range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets sensing range of sensor; communication range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets communication range of sensor; supersonic wave range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets supersonic wave range of sensor; frame delay <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which adjusts moving speed of sensor; sensing range checker, which checks if the sensing range of mobile sensor is visualized; communication range checker, which checks if the communication range of sensor is visualized; supersonic wave range checker, which checks if the supersonic wave range of sensor is visualized; node trace line checker, which checks if the distance in which sensor moved until the current time after being {{deployed in the}} beginning is visualized; goal coverage checker, which stops MSNS from operating when a user reaches the desired coverage; interval time checker, which pauses MSNS in operation during a certain time interval; degree K taker, which receives input {{of the number of}} neighboring sensors that sensors should maintain; number of sensor nodes taker, which receives input of the number of sensors to be deployed in the target area; initial deployment selector, which selects the initial location in which sensor are deployed when the MSNS starts; button to start and reset MSNS; and button to pause MSNS in operation and restart it.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dirty Little Girl" [...] premiered on MTV on February 25, 2009. It was filmed on November 19, 2008 at The <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> in Fullerton, California.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|R

50|$|On 10 May 2001 Spanair Flight 3203 (McDonnell Douglas MD-83 EC-FXI) was {{substantially}} damaged {{when the}} starboard undercarriage collapsed on landing. All 51 {{people on board}} evacuated via the <b>escape</b> <b>slides.</b> It was repaired and returned to service.|$|R
50|$|When {{still life}} scenes are stereographed, an {{ordinary}} single lens camera {{can be moved}} using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> or similar method to generate a stereo pair. Multiple views can be taken and the best pair selected for the desired viewing method.|$|R
50|$|Under his direction, {{the company}} {{developed}} space-suits, {{life support systems}} and rocket emergency <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> for all USSR/Russia spacecraft and orbiting space stations, starting from Vostok 1, including the special inflatable EVA airlock of the Voskhod 2, an open space manoeuvring unit, etc.|$|R
30|$|For ranking {{the results}} of complex {{relationship}} searches on the semantic web, Anyanwu et al. [6] present a flexible approach called SemRank. In this method, {{with the help of}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> user can easily vary their search mode from conventional search mode to discovery search mode.|$|R

50|$|Inflatable {{structures}} and inflatable buildings {{are used in}} many ways including membrane roofs and covers, sails, buildings and pavilions, airships, furniture, airspace structures, boats, <b>escape</b> <b>slides,</b> security mattresses, swimming pools, coverings, games and castles, air bags and many other applications. Examples include an inflatable church and an inflatable pub.|$|R
5000|$|Research & Development Production Enterprise Zvezda, or R&D PE Zvezda (Научно-производственное предприятие [...] "Звезда", НПП Звезда, lit. [...] "Star") is a Russian {{manufacturer}} of life-support systems for high-altitude flight and human spaceflight. Its products include space suits, ejector seats, aircraft <b>escape</b> <b>slides,</b> lifejackets and fire extinguishers. It {{is based in}} Tomilino, near Moscow.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding valves {{which were}} actuated by Heusinger valve gear, with Laird type crossheads with single <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b> To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 May 2001, Spanair Flight 3203 (McDonnell Douglas MD-83 EC-FXI named [...] "Sunseeker") was {{substantially}} damaged {{when the}} starboard undercarriage collapsed while landing at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. All 45 passengers and 5 crew members on board evidently evacuated from the aircraft {{by using the}} <b>escape</b> <b>slides.</b> The substantially-damaged aircraft was repaired and returned to service.|$|R
50|$|An {{approach}} to slide guitar {{that does not}} use a bottleneck worn over a finger {{is to use the}} index and middle fingers to hold a weighted lighter (sold as the fireslide) against the strings. The middle, fourth and fifth fingers are used to fret between the slide and the bridge, allowing the player to perform <b>sliding</b> <b>barred</b> chords and scales.|$|R
50|$|Damage was substantial: the {{fuselage}} was fractured {{in two places}} and the landing gear and both engines detached. Despite considerable damage to the cabin, the crew evacuated the aircraft efficiently. However, 3 of the 8 emergency exits could not be opened and several <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> did not inflate (though with {{the fuselage}} {{sitting on the ground}} this was not a great problem).|$|R
30|$|The buccal segment model {{consisted}} of five (from the second premolar {{to the central}} incisor) monocrystalline ceramic brackets [11]. The interbracket distance was set at 8.5 mm. The canine bracket was welded to a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that allowed different vertical positions, while the other brackets were mounted on a vice-like device. A section of a 0.0215 × 0.028 -in. stainless steel wire was used to align all the brackets.|$|R
50|$|Airplanes {{such as the}} Embraer 145 family, Fokker 50 family, Antonov An-148 family, ATR {{family and}} the Bombardier CRJ-200 family do not have <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> because all exits are at a {{distance}} from the ground (less than 6 ft), below which evacuation assisting devices are not required by regulations. On the primary entrance door, 1L, some of these aircraft have stairs that are either connected to the door or drop down.|$|R
50|$|An {{evacuation}} slide is an inflatable slide used to evacuate an aircraft quickly. An <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> is required on all commercial (passenger carrying) aircraft where the door sill height is such that, {{in the event}} of an evacuation, passengers would be unable to step down from the door uninjured (Federal Aviation Administration requires slides on all aircraft doors where the floor is 6 ft or more above the ground).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>slides</b> {{are packed}} and held within the door {{structure}} inside the slide bustle, a protruding {{part of the}} inside of an aircraft door that varies with aircraft size, door size and door location. In many modern planes, to reduce evacuation time, evacuation slides deploy automatically when a door is opened in an [...] "armed" [...] condition. Modern planes often indicate an armed condition with an indicator light.|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a visualization {{tool for the}} demonstration of a nonideal Carnot engine, operating at finite time. The cycle time can be varied using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> and the pressure-volume, temperature-entropy, power-time, and efficiency-time diagrams change interactively and are shown on one screen. We have evaluated the visualization tool among engineering students at university level during an introductory course on thermodynamics and we review and discuss {{the outcome of the}} evaluation...|$|R
