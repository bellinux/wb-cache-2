40|$|Before a new {{flight control}} system is {{released}} for flight, {{a huge number of}} simulations are evaluated to find weaknesses of the system. This process is called <b>flight</b> <b>clearance.</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>clearance</b> is a very important but time consuming process. There is a need of better <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> methods {{and one of the most}} promising methods is the use of optimization. In this thesis the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> of a simulation model of JAS 39 Gripen is examined. Two <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> algorithms using two different optimization methods are evaluated and compared to each other and to a traditional <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> method. In this thesis the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process is separated into three cases: search for the worst flight condition, search for the worst manoeuvre and search for the worst flight condition including parameter uncertainties. For all cases the optimization algorithms find a more dangerous case than the traditional method. In the search for worst flight condition, both with and without uncertainties, the optimization algorithms are to prefer to the traditional method with respect to the clearance results and the number of objective function calls. The search for the worst manoeuvre is a much more complex problem. Even as the algorithms find more dangerous manoeuvres than the traditional method, it is not certain that they find the worst manoeuvres. If not other methods should be used the problem has to be rephrased. For example other optimization variables or a few linearizations of the optimization problem could reduce the complexity. The overall impression is that the need of information and problem characteristics define which method that is most suitable to use. The information required must be weighed against the cost of objective function calls. Compared to the traditional method, the optimization methods used in this thesis give extended information about the problems examined and are better to locate the worst case...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> {{is to use}} the {{structured}} singular value (μ) analysis of the flight control system when some parameters in the system vary in a certain range. As theμ-analysis can only be done on a linear fractional transformation (LFT) model, the first step of <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> is to generate the LFT model of the flight control system. In this paper, based on the introduction of basic theory of LFT andμ-analysis, an X-fighter is chosen as an example to utilize the proposed methods. In order to realize the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process automatically, a novel software package based on MATLAB programming language is developed. The results of simulation experiments validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel methods proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} two different global optimisation approaches {{to the problem of}} analysing the robustness (<b>flight</b> <b>clearance)</b> of nonlinear <b>flight</b> control systems. The analysis employs a typical nonlinear clearance criterion used by the European aerospace industry together with a detailed simulation model of a high performance aircraft with a full authority control law. The deterministic optimisation algorithm used in the study is Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT), while the evolutionary algorithm is Differential Evolution. Both algorithms are hybridised with local gradient- based optimisation methods to improve convergence rates near the global solution. The reliability, computational complexity and efficiency of the two approaches are compared for this realistic engineering example, and the prospects for application of optimisation-based methods in the industrial <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to identify and evaluate promising mathematical techniques for re-entry <b>flight</b> <b>clearance.</b> To fulfil this objective, two mathematical methods were investigated and developed: μ analysis for linear models and interval analysis for both linear and non-linear models. The stability of re-entry vehicles {{in the presence of}} model uncertainties was chosen as the clearance criterion, which is represented by two mathematical criteria: worst-case eigenvalues (linear) and the Lyapunov stability (non-linear). Two vehicle models including flight control systems were developed and used as case studies for the evaluation of the clearance techniques. These models are based on the DART (Delft Aerospace Re-entry Test Demonstrator) and SPHYNX (Subscale Precursor Hypersonic X) re-entry vehicle models. The suitability of the two mathematical techniques for re-entry <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> was evaluated {{based on the results of}} the clearance application on these models. Non-linear simulations were also performed to verify the clearance results generated by the two techniques. Non-linear interval analysis has been found to be the most reliable method of all other methods investigated in this research, because it could perform the clearance for the non-linear dynamic models of the re-entry vehicles with uncertainties, and the results were confirmed by the non-linear simulations.

In Pioneer Flight operations, the local government requires the operator to hire local businesses/human resources in the operation, such as for the ticket agents, suppliers, etc. Dirgantara Air Service Area Manager in Samarinda mentioned that in many cases, the local personnel are not qualified or do {{not have the right to}} work in airline operation, but have to be hired anyway. This might influence the safety level of the operation. The {{investigation found}} that there were two load manifests. The original manifest, obtained by the police at Tenggarong District and was suspected to be from Datah Dawai, listed seven adults, one child, and one infant with several items of baggage. The second manifest, numbered 012905, is suspected to have been made in Samarinda. The number on the top right of the document is pasted over, obviously to cover the document's real number. The manifest stated that there were eight adults, two children, and two infants aboard the aircraft and no baggage.

40|$|The classic {{approach}} to calculating the {{power has been}} through a torque balance for the screw multiplied by screw speed[1 - 5]. The torque is calculated through an assumed stress model. Some models assume constant viscosity[1 - 3], and many are two-dimensional[2 - 6]. The influence of the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> is demonstrated[2, 3], {{and the effects of}} <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> and temperature are shown with finite difference methods for two-dimensional flow of power-law viscosity[5]. A macro-energy equation is used to discuss power and heat, but details of quantifying calculations are not presented[6]. This final approach is basic to the starting point of this work. Math Model Energy Balance The conservation of energy for a single barrel zone (Figure 1) of the melt section is assumed to be similar to that of a heat exchanger but with internal heat generation. The melt flows axially through the screw channel and exchanges heat with the barrel. The temperature of the melt changes to account for its heat loss or gain. The screw may also perform pumping work against external pressure. The power to the screw is then given by the conservation of energy as follows: (1) Melt Temperature The crux of the solution to equation 1 is the melt temperature, T (z). This has been previously modeled[7] with viscosity given by. (2) The resulting governing equation for the melt temperature in dimensionless form is given[7] a...|$|R

50|$|The {{distance}} {{by which}} an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In controlled airspace, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on radar, or through aircraft position reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft position reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact. The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.|$|R
