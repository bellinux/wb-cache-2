5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, {{but it has}} been {{estimated}} at 450, of whom 35 were women, making him one of the most active of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was François Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household.|$|E

Jaime reminds Eddard that Aerys <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> Eddard's father and brother; however, Eddard does not consider this grounds for Jaime to break his oath as a knight of the Kingsguard.|$|E
5|$|In early 1860, Ross {{enlisted in}} Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed {{to fight the}} renegade Native Americans. Smith {{appointed}} Ross his second lieutenant. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe which <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> two white families. The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the six {{previous}} {{novels in}} the series, the titular character Harry Potter {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only wizard to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by the evil Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, who <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, in the belief this would frustrate a prophecy that Harry would become his equal. As an orphan, Harry {{was placed in the}} care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon Dursley.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} {{off and on}} for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E

5|$|Ernest was {{an active}} member of the House of Lords, where he {{maintained}} an extremely conservative voting record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia. Before Victoria succeeded to the British throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest acceded to the Hanoverian throne. Becoming Hanover's first ruler to reside in the state since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy when he dismissed the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E

5|$|Outraged by {{this act}} of police violence, local anarchists quickly printed and {{distributed}} fliers calling for a rally the following day at Haymarket Square (also called the Haymarket), which was then a bustling commercial center near the corner of Randolph Street and Desplaines Street. Printed in German and English, the fliers claimed that the police <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> the strikers on behalf of business interests and urged workers to seek justice. The first batch of fliers contain the words Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force! When Spies saw the line, {{he said he would}} not speak at the rally unless the words were removed from the flier. All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed, and new fliers were printed without the offending words. More than 20,000 copies of the revised flier were distributed.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Huie's {{interview}} with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission that they <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> Till caused prominent {{civil rights leaders}} to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder contributed to congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in local law enforcement issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie's interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about Collins and Loggins and others who had possibly been involved in Till's abduction and murder, or the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.|$|E
5|$|She {{fought with}} the Spanish Republican Navy in the Spanish Civil War. At the {{outbreak}} of the Nationalist revolt, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from General Francisco Franco to rebels in Morocco. They alerted the crews aboard Jaime I and other ships, who mutinied against their rebellious officers and ensured the ships would remain under Republican control. The vessels were nevertheless crippled by poor discipline for some time, as they <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> many of their officers, and distrusted those that were not killed. On the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them Ceuta, Melilla and Algeciras. In Algeciras she hit with her secondary armament the Nationalist gunboat Eduardo Dato, which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|Bruce is {{kept under}} {{observation}} at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, {{but instead of}} turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material he touches or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> his wife {{in front of the}} child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, leading to a more powerful transformation of the Hulk. Talbot is killed in an explosion created when he attempted to use a special syringe to gain a sample of the creature. The Hulk escapes the base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. When Betty calms Bruce into his human form, General Ross realizes the Hulk is uncontrollable and that Bruce should be executed.|$|E
5|$|In his {{strongly}} apologetic divisional {{history of}} the division which he later commanded, Otto Kumm claims that the division captured Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac, killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400 during Case White. After a short rest and refit in April, the division was committed to Case Black in May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the Mostar area into the Italian governorate of Montenegro and killed, according to Kumm, 250 Partisans and captured over 500. The historian Thomas Casagrande notes that all German units fighting partisans routinely counted the civilians they <b>had</b> <b>murdered</b> as partisans. Therefore it can be assumed that the reported number of inflicted casualties included many civilians. The division played a decisive role during the fighting. Although Himmler had already planned to award Phleps with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross {{for his role in}} organising the 7th SS Division, it was for the achievements of his division during Case Black that Phleps received the award. Phleps was also portrayed in the SS-magazine Das Schwarze Korps. He received the Knight's Cross in July 1943, while he was also promoted to Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general), and placed in command of the V SS Mountain Corps.|$|E
