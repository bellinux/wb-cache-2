5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo (1950).|$|E
25|$|After the war, Geisel {{focused on}} children's books once again, writing {{classics}} like If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, four feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Geisel and {{his wife}} moved to La Jolla, California where he {{returned}} to writing children's books. He wrote many, including such favorites as If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): McElligot's Pool (1947), Bartholomew and the Oobleck (1949), and If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in Redbook Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as The Sneetches and Other Stories) or reworked into independent books (If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.|$|E
50|$|The unmarked verb form (as in <b>run,</b> feel) is <b>the</b> infinitive {{with the}} {{particle}} to omitted. It indicates nonpast tense with no modal implication. In an inherently stative verb such as feel, it can indicate present time (I feel well) or future in dependent clauses (I'll come tomorrow if I feel better). In an inherently non-stative verb such as <b>run,</b> <b>the</b> unmarked form can indicate gnomic or habitual situations (birds fly; <b>I</b> <b>run</b> every day) or scheduled futurity, {{often with a}} habitual reading (tomorrow <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> 100 meter race at 5:00; next month <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> 100 meter race every day). Non-stative verbs in unmarked form appearing in dependent clauses can indicate even unscheduled futurity (I'll feel better after <b>I</b> <b>run</b> tomorrow; I'll feel better if <b>I</b> <b>run</b> every day next month).|$|R

25|$|An {{editorial}} cartoon from July 16, 1941 {{depicts a}} whale {{resting on the}} top of a mountain as a parody of American isolationists, especially Charles Lindbergh. This was later rendered (with no apparent political content) as the Wumbus of On Beyond Zebra (1955). Seussian whales (cheerful and balloon-shaped, with long eyelashes) also occur in McElligot's Pool, If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus, and other books.|$|E
500|$|Geisel {{returned}} to fictionalized versions {{of his home}} town in three later books, which, together with Mulberry Street, form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle. McElligot's Pool (1947), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Zoo (1950), and If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with [...] "a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios." [...] McElligot's Pool also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Random House {{released}} [...] "Horton Hatches the Egg" [...] in its {{series of}} Dr. Seuss videos, narrated by Billy Crystal {{and directed by}} Mark Reeder. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus" [...] is second in the double feature video.|$|E

500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know. When <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> lap I knew I gave up {{a little bit of time}} right in the middle of both corners but I had a plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked. I’m really proud of that lap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{books by}} Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also contain many lines written in amphibrachic tetrameter, {{such as these}} from If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus: ...|$|E
2500|$|Geisel also {{follows the}} cartoon {{tradition}} of showing motion with lines, {{like in the}} sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate {{the action of the}} senses—sight, smell, and hearing—in The Big Brag, and lines even illustrate [...] "thought", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.|$|E

2500|$|Geisel's {{style was}} unique – his figures are often [...] "rounded" [...] and {{somewhat}} droopy. This is true, for instance, {{of the faces}} of the Grinch and the Cat in the Hat. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy steam calliope.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of creatures who arrange themselves in repeating patterns, such as the [...] "Two and fro walkers, who march in five layers", and the Through-Horns Jumping Deer in If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus, and the arrangement of birds which the protagonist of Oh, the Places You'll Go! walks through, as the narrator admonishes him to [...] "...always be dexterous and deft, and never mix up your right foot with your left." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon, Mattarella became isolated. The {{inspector}} he {{had asked}} to conduct {{an investigation into the}} public contracts in Palermo, Raimondo Mignosi, recalled the air of intimidation at the time: “I told him to be careful because <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> risk of ending up in a cement block, at which he replied, ‘That’s not true, I’ll end up in the cement.’ To break the tension, we jokingly agreed that we would both end up in cement blocks side by side.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{took place}} at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. On the first day Stein told his crew that since the Jacksons were devout Jehovah's Witnesses, no drugs or alcohol would be tolerated on the set. Shortly {{thereafter}} {{he was looking for}} two of them he needed for a sequence. Behind a cyclorama he saw them in 30-foot-high (...) silhouette [...] "shoveling something into their nostrils. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> length of two football fields, kicked over the lights and no one ever saw it but me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> race," [...] Stallard said in Winning, [...] "I didn't think {{anything}} of it. I {{just thought it}} was something that would be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geisel's {{illustrations}} often convey motion vividly. He {{was fond}} of a sort of [...] "voilà" [...] gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in One Fish Two Fish when he creates fish (who perform the gesture themselves with their fins), in {{the introduction of the}} various acts of If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> <b>the</b> Circus, and in the introduction of the [...] "Little Cats" [...] in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.|$|E

2500|$|Weston {{was born}} in Alpena, Michigan to Frank and Jane Weston [...] He was raised in Sault Ste. Marie, and was a star player on Sault Ste. Marie High School's 1913 state {{championship}} football team. The Sault Ste. Marie “Blue Devils” were a football powerhouse with Weston. In a 1972 interview with his home town newspaper, Weston recalled the 1913 championship team: “We were an awful bunch of roughnecks – there was no football team in the state tougher than we were that year. We blasted all of them and loved doing it.” Weston was asked about a 1913 newspaper report {{that he had been}} tackled by an irate woman during a 24-7 win over Alpena. He recalled the incident:”The game was played there, and the fans hated us. We were too rough to suit them. I was running around the left end toward the Alpena side of the field. There was nobody near me as <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> end, and all of a sudden, this woman dives from the sideline and drops me for no gain. Well, I was so surprised I couldn’t get up at first.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
