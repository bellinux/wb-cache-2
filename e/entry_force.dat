KFOR, a NATO force, had been preparing to conduct combat operations, {{but in the}} end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General Mike Jackson of the British Army. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a French Army Brigade, a German Army brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and Italian Army and US Army brigades. The U.S. contribution, known as the Initial <b>Entry</b> <b>Force,</b> was led by the U.S. 1st Armored Division. Subordinate units included TF 1–35 Armor from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the U.S. force was the Greek Army's 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{analysis was used}} to investigate the added mass momentum, flow momentum and gravity effects during the constant velocity water entry of wedge-shaped sections with deadrise angles from 5 degrees to 45 degrees. It is shown that the added mass continues to increase for a time after chine immersion and that added mass can be estimated in terms of a constant added mass coefficient and an effective wetted width. A momentum theory is presented in which the water <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> is explained as the sum of the rate of change of added mass momentum, which becomes zero at immersion to chine depth ratios greater than about three, and the rate of change of flow momentum, which continues at deep immersions. The effect of gravity on the water <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> is given as the hydrostatic force together with the force necessary to create the potential energy in the water pile up. Hydrodynamic forces are not significantly changed by the effect of gravity on the flow fields...|$|E

40|$|Air intake related {{aerodynamic}} {{aspects of}} an air breathing cruise missile are analyzed. A method for thrust and drag accounting is established, and, based on that, a partial simulation model for the thrust and intake spillage drag force of the missile is developed. The model combines wind tunnel data with analytical data. The intake spillage force has two components, pre <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> and cowl force. The pre <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> can be computed relatively easily, while the cowl force depends strongly upon actual intake geometry and no general method exists. An approximate cowl force is computed based on available data. The accuracy of the cowl drag results is difficult to predict, as no complete theoretical model is available, and the partial models published cite no accuracy limits. The cowl drag results need further verification through wind tunnel tests or CFD analysis. However, spillage force results are produced {{that are in the}} magnitude of 30 % of total drag, which is expected. Also, dependencies on known variables and trends are as expected. Finally, flight test profiles in order to validate the model are suggested...|$|E
30|$|A study {{revealed}} that blunt-tipped conical port instruments have a significantly greater fixity to the abdominal wall compared to cutting port instruments, resulting in significantly lower numbers of spontaneous port dislodgement during surgery [14]. Accordingly, the use of blunt-tipped instruments could reduce antecedent gas leak and loss of pneumoperitoneum {{and the need for}} port replacement with its associated increase in risk of trauma to the abdominal wall. On the other side, it appeared from animal studies that the <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> needed to perforate the abdominal wall is higher for conical blunt-tipped than pyramidal sharp port instruments [26]. The higher <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> could increase the risk of injuries to the intra- or retroperitoneal organs during insertion. The use of optical-access port instruments does not avoid serious injury despite having the ability to visualize tissue layers during insertion [7]. The TVC is a different system of which some experts consider it could be a less damaging approach [8]. We found insufficient evidence to formulate clear recommendations for safe and cost-effective use of laparoscopic port instruments. Larger comparative studies, with good methodological quality, are needed to clarify the important safety issues. The guideline development group supposes that the selection of a port instrument should, above all, be based on weighing the advantages against disadvantages of its characteristics and the experience of the surgeon with a safe application.|$|E
40|$|Constant {{velocity}} water {{entry is}} important in understanding planing and slamming of marine vessels. A test rig has been developed that drives a wedge section with end plates down guides to enter the water vertically at near constant velocity. <b>Entry</b> <b>force</b> and velocity are measured. Analysis of the test data shows that the wetting factor is about 1. 6 at low deadrise angles and reduces nearly linearly to 1. 3 at 451 deadrise angle. The added mass increases quadratically with immersed depth until the chines become wetted. It then continues to increase at a reducing rate, reaching a maximum value between 20 % and 80 % greater than at chine immersion. The flow momentum drag coefficient is estimated from the results to be 0. 78 at 51 deadrise angle reducing to 0. 41 at 451 deadrise angles. Constant velocity exit tests show that {{the momentum of the}} added mass is expended in driving the water above the surface level and that exit forces are low and equivalent to a drag coefficient of about 1. 0 - 1. 3. Considerable dynamic noise limits the accuracy of the results, particularly after chine immersion...|$|E

40|$|Economic Integration Agreements (EIAs) {{have been}} gaining {{importance}} {{in the last two}} decades in terms of number of countries concluding them, trade flows covered, trade barriers removed and policy domains covered. This dissertation wants to add to the understanding of how these agreements are negotiated and what impact they have, as this is important for academics as well as policymakers and well-informed citizens. In the first two essays of this dissertation, I study the effects of EIAs between the European Union and the rest of the world on the product-level. I find that EIAs have trade-creating effects. This before as well as after entry into force of the agreement. Trade flows start increasing from the moment negotiations of the trade agreement start and this trade creating effect continues up to five years after <b>entry</b> <b>force</b> of the agreement. Especially the number of products exported to a destination (the extensive margin) increases, yet there is great heterogeneity between agreements and EU member states. In a third essay, I confirm these findings on the firm-level using detailed data from Belgian firms. I find that trade agreements present great opportunities for firms, and firms make use of them. Yet, there is again large heterogeneity in the effects of trade agreements: mainly older firms and firms with 50 to 99 employees benefit from trade agreements. In the fourth and last essay, I study the negotiation process of EIAs. I find that the market power of a product is a good predictor of the outcome of bilateral trade negotiations for that product, as well as the lobbying efforts of firms. Goods with higher market power and goods from import-competing sectors that are politically organized to lobby are more likely to be excluded from liberalization in the trade agreement. 1 Introduction 1. 1 A definition of trade agreements 1. 2 A brief history of trade agreements 1. 3 Stylized facts 1. 4 The purpose of trade agreements 1. 5 The costs of trade agreements 1. 6 What to expect 2 Dissecting the trade effects of EUs EIAs 2. 1 Introduction 2. 2 Methodology 2. 3 Data 2. 4 Main results 2. 5 Robustnesschecks 2. 6 Conclusion 2. 7 Appendix 3 Anticipation effects 3. 1 Introduction 3. 2 The lifetime of an EU EIA 3. 3 Literature review 3. 4 Methodology 3. 5 Data 3. 6 Estimation strategy and results 3. 7 Conclusion 3. 8 Appendix 4 Firm-level impact of trade agreements 4. 1 Introduction 4. 2 Theoretical framework 4. 3 Data 4. 4 Setting the stage of Belgium’s exporting firms 4. 5 Baseline model 4. 6 Timing of trade policy effects 4. 7 Trade agreements and firm characteristics 4. 8 Trade agreements and margins of trade 4. 9 Conclusion 4. 10 Appendix 5 Market power and FTAs 5. 1 Introduction 5. 2 The optimal tariff argument 5. 3 Methodology 5. 4 Data 5. 5 Main results 5. 6 Extensions 5. 7 Conclusion 6 Conclusionnrpages: 200 status: publishe...|$|E
