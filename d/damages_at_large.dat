Classic sandwich models predicting the behavior and the failure modes are improved to fit the particular configuration of the structure. Numerical simulations were set up in order to investigate <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> strain. Macroscopic results are compared with analytical models and numerical simulations. Two numerical models of the core allowed confrontation of local behavior with experiments. Criteria for localization and damaging depending on core architecture are proposed.

50|$|Nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is a {{food plant}} of some {{caterpillars}} which feed primarily on {{members of the}} cabbage family (brassicas), and some gardeners claim that planting them around brassicas protects the food crops from damage, as eggs of the pests are preferentially laid on the nasturtium. This practice is called trap cropping (using alternative plants to attract pests away from a main crop). However, while many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, {{only a small portion}} of these plants have been shown to reduce pest <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> <b>larger</b> commercial scales.|$|R
30|$|In both models, the {{simulated}} sub-surface damages increase with increasing fiber orientation, {{and the values}} and trends {{are close to the}} experiment for fiber orientations below 75 °. However, the predicted damage drops when the fiber orientation increases further to 90 °, leading to a large discrepancy between {{the simulated}} and experimental sub-surface <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> <b>larger</b> fiber orientations. This result occurs because the simulated sub-surface damage is only related to the material failure (fiber/matrix cracking or crushing). However during the cutting experiment, fiber-matrix interface debonding also contributes to sub-surface damages. This mechanism plays a minor role for small fiber orientations but a significant role at 90 ° orientation, where the interface debonding can extend severely below the machined surface [1 – 3]. The fiber-matrix interface and its damage process are not modeled and simulated appropriately in the macro-mechanical FE models, and a multiphase micro-mechanical model is thus required.|$|R
5000|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a plant that}} attracts {{agricultural}} pests, usually insects, away from nearby crops. This form of companion planting can save the main crop from decimation by pests {{without the use of}} pesticides. [...] While many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, {{only a small portion of}} these plants have been shown to reduce pest <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> <b>larger</b> commercial scales. A common explanation for reported trap cropping failures, is that attractive trap plants only protect nearby plants if the insects do not move back into the main crop. In a review of 100 trap cropping examples in 2006, only 10 trap crops where classified as successful at a commercial scale, [...] and in all successful cases, trap cropping was supplemented with management practices that specifically limited insect dispersal from the trap crop back into the main crop.|$|R

But {{the effect of the}} eccentricity on the behavior of joint is not well known, due to lack of test results. So three specimens of one third scale reinforced concrete interior beam-column subassembladges were constructed and loaded to failure by statically cyclic load simulating earthquake, to obtain fundamental data including three dimensional deformation of beam-column joint. The test results indicated that the eccentricity in the joints led to lower capacity in story shear and severe damage of concrete on the side to which the center line of beam shifted to. Increasing in the joint shear reinforcement on the side of beam shifted to was not effective to mitigate the concentration of concrete <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> displacement reversals, whereas it was effective to reduce the crack width at the small story drift loading stages.

40|$|Blast induced soil {{vibrations}} {{can cause}} structural <b>damage</b> even <b>at</b> <b>large</b> distances from the source, causing {{the need for}} accurate prediction methods. The occurrence of shock waves and the high strain rates and deformations call {{for the use of}} hydrocodes in the proximity of an explosion. <b>At</b> <b>larger</b> distance, the use of a more cost effective linear elastic calculation tool is preferred. A coupled numerical model is proposed, which combines a 2 D axisymmetric Finite Difference Time Domain model in Autodyn with a frequency domain linear elastic method. The Autodyn model uses a coupled Eulerian-ALE-Lagrangian solver and is truncated in the linear elastic hydrocode domain. Spurious reflections are avoided by adding an unsplit field PerfectlyMatched Layer to the truncated hydrocode domain. The results at an interface in the linear elastic hydrocode domain are used to compute results in the far field, based on the dynamic reciprocity theorem and the Green’s functions of a layered elastic halfspace. The methodology is validated against a linear elastic reference solution and applied to a small subsurface explosion in a non elastic soil. The blast induced vibrations are determined at distances up to 200 m from the source and are compared to empirical reference results. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceApplications of {{reinforced}} composites and heterogeneous solids are widespread, spanning technological {{areas of}} various aerospace and mechanical industries. A real challenge concerning these materials is their life time prediction when subjected to {{wide variety of}} environmental and mechanical loading conditions that can initiate damage and lead to failure. Indeed, <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> the smallest scales drives <b>damage</b> accumulation <b>at</b> <b>larger</b> length scales until some critical local damage state is attained that causes macroscopic failure. A key issue in predicting life time is to characterise distributed volumic and localised damage and to understand the mechanisms of its initiation, evolution and criticality and so, the identification of relevant precursors of failure. To answer to these questions, volumic and guided ultrasonic waves and acoustic emission are of particular interest. As {{a matter of fact}} volumic ultrasonic wave propagation is sensitive to homogeneously distributed microcracks and represents in that case a good damage indicator. Guided waves as Lamb waves especially when generated from inside the material using an inserted piezoelectric element offer a specific sensitivity to localised damage as cracks or delaminations. Besides, acoustic emission which corresponds to the energy released by the material during the damage processes {{is directly related to the}} damage mechanisms and so can give pertinent information about the damage initiation and development. In this paper, our aim is to show in the one hand the ability of volumic ultrasonic waves to characterise volumic damage of glass epoxy composites under hydrothermal ageing and also the ability of Lamb waves to detect and identify localised damage. In the other hand our purpose is to demonstrate the potentiality of acoustic emission in understanding the damage mechanisms that occurs during a tensile test of polymer fibre composites and to discriminate in real time the different types of <b>damage</b> occurring <b>at</b> the microscopic scale...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present work aims at {{developing}} a methodology {{for the detection}} and monitoring of damage and fractures in building materials in the prospects of energetic renovation. Digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring were simultaneously performed during tensile loading tests of fibre reinforced mortar samples. The full-field displacement mappings obtained by DIC revealed all ranges of cracks, from microscopic to macroscopic, and an image processing procedure was conducted as to quantify their evolution {{in the course of}} the degradation of the samples. The comparison of these measurements with the acoustic activity of the material showed a fair match in terms of quantification and localisation of damage. It is shown that after such a calibration procedure, AE monitoring can be autonomously used for the characterisation of <b>damage</b> and fractures <b>at</b> <b>larger</b> scales...|$|R
40|$|Characterising {{the passive}} {{anisotropic}} properties of soft tissues {{has been largely}} limited to the linear viscoelastic regime and shear loading is rarely done in the large deformation regime, despite the physiological significance of such properties. This paper demonstrates the use of eccentric rheology, which allows the anisotropy of skeletal muscle to be investigated. The large amplitude oscillatory strain properties of skeletal muscle were also investigated using Fourier Transform-rheology. Histology was used to qualitatively assess the microstructure changes induced by large strain. Results showed that skeletal muscle was strongly anisotropic in the linear regime. The storage and loss moduli {{were found to be}} significantly different (p< 0. 05) between the three fibre alignment groups; for the group tested with fibres perpendicular to plane of shear was 12. 3 ± 1. 3 kPa and 3. 0 ± 0. 35 kPa, parallel to shear direction was 10. 6 ± 1. 2 kPa and 2. 4 ± 0. 23 kPa, and perpendicular to shear direction was 5. 5 ± 0. 90 kPa and 1. 3 ± 0. 21 kPa. The appearance and growth of higher order harmonics <b>at</b> <b>large</b> strain was different in the three testing directions indicating that the anisotropy of muscle affects skeletal muscle behaviour in the nonlinear regime. Histological analysis showed an increasing destruction of extracellular matrix and the rearrangement of fibres with increasing strain indicating mechanical <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> strains of <b>larger</b> than 10 %. These microstructural changes could contribute to the complex nonlinear behaviour in skeletal muscle. This paper demonstrates a method of characterising the anisotropic properties in skeletal muscle under large strain whilst giving meaningful information on the physical response of tissue at various strains. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we studied}} effects of {{phosphonium}} dications P 2 C 5 and P 2 C 10 on bilayer planar phospholipid membrane (BLM) and rat liver mitochondria. In line with our previous observations [M. F. Ross, T. Da Ros, F. H. Blaikie, T. A. Prime, C. M. Porteous, I. I. Severina, V. P. Skulachev, H. G. Kjaergaard, R. A. Smith, M. P. Murphy, Accumulation of lipophilic dications by mitochondria and cells, Biochem. J. 400 (2006) 199 – 208], we showed both P 2 C 5 and P 2 C 10 are cationic penetrants for BLM. They generated transmembrane diffusion potential (ΔΨ), the compartment {{with a lower}} dication concentration positive. However, the ΔΨ values measured proved to be lower that the Nernstian. This fact {{could be explained by}} rather low BLM conductance for the cations at their small concentrations and by induction of some BLM <b>damage</b> <b>at</b> their <b>large</b> concentrations. The damage in question consisted in appearance of non-Ohmic current/voltage relationships which increased in time. Such a non-Ohmicity was especially strong at ΔΨ > 100  mV. Addition of penetrating lipophilic anion TPB, which increases the BLM conductance for lipophilic cations, yielded the Nernstian ΔΨ, i. e. 30  mV per ten-fold dication gradient. In the State 4 mitochondria, dications stimulated respiration and lowered ΔΨ. Moreover, they inhibited the State 3 respiration with succinate or glutamate and malate (but not with TMPD and ascorbate) in an uncoupler-sensitive fashion. Effect on the in State 4 mitochondria, similarly to that on BLM, was accounted for by a time-dependent membrane damage. On the other hand, the State 3 effect was most probably due to inhibition of the respiratory chain Complex I and/or Complex III. The damaging and inhibitory activities of lipophilic dications should be taken into account when one considers a possibility to use them as a vehicle to target antioxidants or other compounds to mitochondria...|$|R
