50|$|Larger wings give better payload and {{maneuverability}} {{in proportion}} of its thrust, but {{also tend to}} add weight to the airframe in various ways. More weight can have negative effects on acceleration, climbing, payload, and range. To make the larger wings lighter the skin, spars, ribs and cap of the wings were made from <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> and co-cured in an autoclave. This was the first application of co-cured technology to a production tactical fighter. This technology for the wings encountered some teething problems, but {{proved to be a}} leading-edge use of a technology that provides weight savings, improved range, and some stealth benefits. This technology was then transferred back to America, as part of the program’s industrial partnership.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{being evaluated}} uses voltammetric sensors combined in an electronic tongue {{to observe the}} antioxidant capacity in red wines. These Electronic Tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants. As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a reference electrode (Silver/Silver Chloride electrode). [...] Furthermore, a platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the <b>Graphite-Epoxy</b> <b>Composite</b> (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals were complex and needed an additional extraction stage. [...] It {{was found that the}} ET method could successfully analyze wine’s antioxidant capacity as it agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, Folin-Ciocalteu, and I280 indexes. [...] Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample {{did not have to be}} pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminshed the popularity of traditional methods. [...] Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results.|$|E
40|$|The present paper aims to miniaturize a graphite-epoxy and {{synthetic}} zeolite-modified <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> macroelectrode as a quasi-microelectrode aiming in vitro and also, envisaging in vivo simultaneous electrochemical detection of dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA) neurotransmitters, or DA detection {{in the presence}} of AA. The electrochemical behavior and the response of the designed materials to the presence of dopamine and ascorbic acid without any protective membranes were studied by cyclic voltammetry and constant-potential amperometry techniques. The catalytic effect towards dopamine detection was proved for the synthetic zeolite-modified <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> quasi-microelectrode, allowing increasing the sensitivity and selectivity for this analyte detection, besides a possible electrostatic attraction between dopamine cation and the negative surface of the synthetic zeolite and electrostatic repulsion with ascorbic acid anion.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying the in situ fiberization process to the fabrication of strain isolation pads (SIP) for the Space Shuttle {{and to the}} fabrication of <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composites</b> was evaluated.

High temperature polymers suitable for SIP use were fiberized and a successful fiberization of polychloro trifluoroethylene, a relatively high melting polymer, was achieved. Attempts to fiberize polymers with greater thermal stability were unsuccessful, apparently due to characteristics caused {{by the presence of}} aromaticity in the backbone of such materials. <b>Graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composites</b> were fabricated by interconnecting two dimensional arrays of graphite fiber with polypropylene IS fibers with subsequent epoxy resin impregnation.

40|$|The radio {{frequency}} mass gauge (RFMG) is a low-gravity propellant quantity gauge being developed at NASA for possible use in long-duration space missions utilizing cryogenic propellants. As {{part of the}} RFMG technology development process, we evaluated the compatibility of the RFMG with a <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> material used to construct propellant tanks. The key material property that can affect compatibility with the RFMG is the electrical conductivity. Using samples of 8552 IM 7 <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite,</b> we characterized the resistivity and reflectivity over a range of frequencies. An RF impedance analyzer was used to characterize the out-of-plane electrical properties (along the sample thickness) in the frequency range 10 to 1800 MHZ. The resistivity value at 500 MHz was 4. 8 ohm-cm. Microwave waveguide measurements of samples in the range 1. 7 2. 6 GHz, performed by inserting the samples into a WR- 430 waveguide, showed reflectivity values above 98. Together, these results suggested that a tank constructed from <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> would produce good quality electromagnetic tank modes, which is needed for the RFMG. This was verified by room-temperature measurements of the electromagnetic modes of a 2. 4 m diameter tank constructed by Boeing from similar <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> material. The quality factor Q of the tank electromagnetic modes, measured via RF reflection measurements from an antenna mounted in the tank, was typically in the range 400 Q 3000. The good quality modes observed in the tank indicate that the RFMG is compatible with graphite-epoxy tanks, and thus the RFMG {{could be used as}} a low-gravity propellant quantity gauge in such tanks filled with cryogenic propellants...|$|E

40|$|Passive {{stabilization}} {{methods for}} satellites have undergone extensive research and development. Recently {{the number of}} small satellites (satellites less than 100 kg.) has increased dramatically. This has lead to increased use of passive stabilization methods, such as gravity-gradient. The core of a gravity-gradient stabilization system is a deployable boom with a damping mechanism. Traditionally, this boom is constructed from metal alloys. Uneven heating and cooling occurs when these alloys are exposed to varying solar radiation conditions. This can induce thermal vibrations {{which can lead to}} undesired satellite attitude inversions. <b>Graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composites</b> can be fabricated to minimize thermal expansion. This will be beneficial when applied to gravity-gradient booms. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composites</b> in gravity-gradient booms.

40|$|An amperometric magneto-immunosensor (AMIS) for the {{detection}} of residues of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in milk samples is described for the first time. The immunosensor presented combines magnetic beads biomodified with an antibody with a broad recognition profile of fluoroquinolones, a haptenized enzyme and a magnetic <b>graphite–epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> (m-GEC) electrode. After the immunochemical reaction with specific enzyme tracer, the antibody biomodified magnetic beads are easily captured by an electrode made of <b>graphite-epoxy</b> <b>composite</b> containing a magnet, which also acts as transducer for the electrochemical detection. In spite of the complexity of milk, the use of magnetic beads allows elimination of potential interferences caused by the matrix components; hence the AMIS could perform quantitative measurements, directly in these samples, without any additional sample cleanup or extraction step. The immunosensor is able to detect up to seven different fluoroquinolones far below the MRLs defined by the UE for milk; for example ciprofloxacin is detected directly in milk with an IC 50 of 0. 74 µg/L and a LOD of 0. 009 µg/L.
