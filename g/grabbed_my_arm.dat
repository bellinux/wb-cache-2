And indeed on {{thinking}} it over {{it would have}} been plausible enough if there hadn't been always the essential falseness of irresponsibility in Schomberg's chatter. However, I was not disposed to investigate the psychology of Falk. I was engaged just then in eating despondently a piece of stale Dutch cheese, being too much crushed to care what I swallowed myself, let along bothering my head about Falk's ideas of gastronomy. I could expect from their study no clue to his conduct in matters of business, which seemed to me totally unrestrained by morality or even by the commonest sort of decency. How insignificant and contemptible I must appear, for the fellow to dare treat me like this--I reflected suddenly, writhing in silent agony. And I consigned Falk and all his peculiarities to the devil with so much mental fervour as to forget Schomberg's existence, till he <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> urgently.

5000|$|On July 16, 2004, Herring {{returned}} {{as a guest}} star on General Hospital, in order for Lucy to attend Lila Quartermaine's funeral. On July 24, 2009, {{it was reported that}} Herring would return to daytime television after years of absence, but on As the World Turns, not General Hospital. This raised eyebrows with fans of the show. Herring said, [...] "This lady on the subway <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and said, 'Why did you leave [...] "GH"? They blame you for not being there. I said, 'I would have loved to go back to [...] "GH," [...] but they didn't ask me.'" [...] Of her decision to join ABC Daytime's rival series, Herring stated, [...] "Truthfully if GH had asked first, I would have been there in a heartbeat, and I let them know that too. I think with the mafia and their different stories, the older characters that I interacted with aren’t there anymore, with Jon going away, Kin not being there, Tony Geary, and Jane Elliot. Jane and I talk all the time too, and she’s one, Tracy and Lucy passed a little bit, and they would be hilarious together, Jane would sometimes call and say you should really think about coming back. If they would have asked, I would have been there. So it’s not my fault." [...] The actress expressed interest in returning to General Hospital.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contributing}} factor to domestic violence among football players {{may be that}} they are desensitized to physical conduct {{because it is a}} part of what they do all the time. Stanley Teitelbaum, a Ph.D Clinical Psychologist and author of Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols and Illusions and Disillusions agrees with the previous statement by Mitch Abrams, saying, [...] "They're (elite football players) trained to be very aggressive and somewhat violent on the field, that's the nature of the game and that’s how they become important players. And sometimes it's difficult for athletes to turn that off when they go back to their regular lives." [...] Some players are raised in an environment where violence is used to resolve conflict. As one is raised in an environment that welcomes violence, their propensity to repeat what they've seen, or what has been done to them may increase. Adrian Peterson has said that he disciplined his son the way he was disciplined as a child, then {{went on to say that}} he will, [...] "Never use a switch again" [...] (in reference to accusations of disciplining his 4-year old with a whip.) In almost every case, the domestic violence involves male athletes who play violent sports physically abusing wives or girlfriends. In 2010, starting running back Steve Jackson of the St. Louis Rams was accused of beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child. His former girlfriend, Supriya Harris, said that Jackson “forcibly <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> flung me against the door and repeatedly pushed me to the ground.” Jackson took Harris to the hospital and told her to tell the doctors she had fallen in the shower. Ten days later, she delivered their child, but the couple separated four months later after he threatened her again.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes {{relatives}} {{have taken}} me {{on one side}} and told me they cannot bear it any more:"Isn't there something you can do to end it all?"More often requests for euthanasia have come from those who are ill. I remember visiting a man with lung cancer. He asked his wife to leave the room. As she closed the door he leaned over and <b>grabbed</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> "I want to die", he said. "Please can you give me something. " He felt a burden on his wife and wanted euthanasia for himself. Often in their duty, physicians are faced with euthanasia requests of this kind. Death is the inevitable fate of all humans but how we die is an issue of great concern for many of us. Fear of pain, loss of control and being a burden to our loved ones are common issues surrounding dying and death of patients. This has led to varying circumstances of patients’ death, and of a significant remark, the involvement of physicians in bringing about these deaths through an act of euthanasia. Euthanasia involves the intentional killing of a patient by the direct intervention of a physician (or another party) ostensibly {{for the good of the}} patient, and the most common form that this comes is through lethal injection. The ethics of euthanasia and of a physicians’ involvement have been a contentious issue from the beginnings of medicine. This for the most part is as a result that the ethical code of physicians has long been based in part on the Hippocratic Oath, which requires physicians to “do no harm”. Thus, the focus of this work will be to look into the role of the physician in ending a patient’s life through the act of euthanasia. Although necessary but not a central point of this work to merely develop arguments for and against the justification of euthanasia and a physician’s involvement in the act, but to critically view the role played by physicians in ending the life of patients through euthanasia in contrast with their medical obligation. The issue of euthanasia raises ethical questions for physicians. Is it morally right or wrong for a physician to end the life of his or her patient? And this therefore will be the focus of this work...|$|E
40|$|Some {{time ago}} at a {{national}} meeting, I was hung out todry. On {{the spur of the}} moment, and appealing to my vanity, a course director (who shall be nameless until I get even with him) asked if I might show my legendary com-munication skills before a group by using a standardized patient. I would go first, show them how it was done, that sort of thing. Trapped by my ego, I was led to the slaughter—a hall of some 500 attendees watching on closed-circuit television—and handed an index card with my instructions. I was to meet the wife of my critical care unit patient in the family room and tell her that her hus-band was doing poorly and would not survive.

At first we thought you or some of the boys had dressed her up and lifted her out there for a joke, and left her to frighten us!
