5|$|Members of the IOC did not <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> votes, but {{news reports}} speculated that broad {{international}} support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations {{who had received}} assistance from China {{in the construction of}} stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision. Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E
5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the United States would have to <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further down the line, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> source of funding. Campaign funding may start six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when the costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over €1,500 in value.|$|E
30|$|Looking at {{the year}} of HIV diagnosis, {{significant}} differences were found only in spirituality of resilience (factor 5) (Kruskal-Wallis =  9.59; p <  0.05). Patients who were diagnosed between 1985 and 1990 (between 23 and 28  years of diagnosis) showed greater spirituality than those diagnosed between 1996 and 2000 (13 and 17  years of diagnosis). As for the number of persons to whom patients had <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> seropositive status, {{significant differences were found}} only in the personal competence, high standards, and tenacity factor for resilience (factor 1) (Kruskal-Wallis =  9.38; p <  0.05). Patients who had <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> HIV-positive status to more than 30 persons had higher personal competence, higher standards, and higher tenacity than patients who had <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> HIV-positive status to between 1 and 5 persons.|$|R

25|$|In {{an online}} survey carried out among over 75,000 Yougov panel {{participants}} in Britain, 90.9% identified as heterosexual, 5.8% as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 1.3% {{opted not to}} give an answer, and 2.1% gave other reasons. The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Ethnic minorities {{were less likely to}} identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not to <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). More LGB than heterosexual respondents indicated they {{would be less likely to}} <b>disclose</b> <b>their</b> true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.|$|E

The researchers noted that LGBT veterans may be uncomfortable <b>disclosing</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation or gender identity because {{when they were in}} the military this information could lead to their discharge from service. Although VHA never had a policy prohibiting care to LGBT veterans, former military personnel often associate military policy with VHA policy. [...] Sherman and colleagues also found that some LGBT veterans worried that <b>disclosing</b> <b>their</b> sexual or gender minority status would lead to losing VA medical benefits, even though there is a Patient’s Rights and Responsibilities Policy that prevents this type of discrimination.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in four aspects of job satisfaction between gay men/lesbians and heterosexuals. The analysis results suggest that {{gay men and lesbians}} are less satisfied with their jobs, by all job satisfaction measures, than heterosexual employees, all other factors being held constant. Gay men and lesbians who have <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation at their present job are more satisfied with their jobs than those who have not. In addition, gay men and lesbians who <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation at their current workplace longer ago are more satisfied with their jobs than gay men and lesbians who <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation more recently. Moreover, adverse mental health symptoms have the same negative impact on employees' job satisfaction regardless of sexual orientation. Furthermore, gay men and lesbians receive lower wages than comparable heterosexual employees. Whilst, the wage gap due to sexual orientation is greater in the group of very dissatisfied men than in the group of very satisfied men, and gay men and lesbians who have <b>disclosed</b> <b>their</b> sexual orientation at their present job receive lower wages than those who have not, but they still have higher levels of job satisfaction. It seems that the effect of disclosure on job satisfaction is the net effect of the connections between disclosure and job satisfaction...|$|R
