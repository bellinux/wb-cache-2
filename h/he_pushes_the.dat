500|$|Not {{all agree}} with McCaw's playing style and {{many believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> {{boundaries}} of legality. He has been labeled a [...] "cheat" [...] by both former South Africa coach Peter de Villiers and former Australian coach Bob Dwyer. Longtime Springboks lock Victor Matfield said in 2010 that the referees let [...] "him get away with murder" [...] at the breakdown. Shortly after the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final, veteran France back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy criticised McCaw saying that [...] "he played the whole match in our [...] camp." [...] Former Australian coach Eddie Jones and flanker Phil Waugh say he does no {{more than any other}} good openside, but his skill at judging how the referee will interpret the breakdown is the main reason for his success. McCaw admits that he tests the referee early [...] "to know what you can get away with" [...] and that only an [...] "idiot" [...] would not adapt to their rulings.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{stories are}} told about Judah to {{illustrate}} {{different aspects of}} his character. One of them begins by telling of a calf breaking free from being led to slaughter. According to the story, the calf tries to hide under Judah's robes, bellowing with terror, but <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> animal away, saying: [...] "Go — for this purpose you were created." [...] For this, Heaven inflicted upon him kidney stones, painful flatulence and other gastric problems, saying, [...] "Since he showed no pity, let us bring suffering upon him." ...|$|E

You will see that he takes up five sovereigns from the heap before him, {{and that he has}} them in his hand when <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> card out. You will notice how he fixes his eye upon the dealer, and that he leaves either one or five, as I have said. He does it, at times, all through the evening, {{especially}} when Gordon is dealing; for I can tell, myself, by Gordon's face whether he has a good or a bad card. Of course, he can see it, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Several," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "All {{are much}} alike in habits. One who lives {{a little farther}} north is called Brewer's Mole or the Hairytailed Mole. His tail is {{a little longer than}} Miner's and is covered with fine hair. The largest and handsomest member of the family is the Oregon Mole of the Northwest. His coat is very dark and his fur {{extremely}} fine. His ways are much the same as those of Miner whom you have just met, excepting that when he is tunneling deep in the ground <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> earth to the surface after the manner of Grubby Gopher, and his mounds become a nuisance to farmers. When he is tunneling just under the surface he makes ridges exactly like these of his eastern cousin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{ever will}} be. I have since {{spoke with the}} mariners of that sea {{concerning}} the sight, but never found any who could pretend to have seen it. There was indeed one bold enough to say, there is a church, far inland, of height and magnitude sufficient to be seen some leagues at sea, and that, favored by our position and the mists that hung above the low grounds, we had seen its upper works, looming above the fogs, and lighted for some brilliant ceremony; but we were all too old in seaman's experience to credit so wild a tale. I know not but a church may loom, {{as well as a}} hill or a ship; but he, who pretends to say, that the hands of man can thus pile stones among the clouds, should be certain of believers, ere <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> tale too far." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following his {{performance}} during Kettering's win over York City in October, player-coach Paul Furlong commented that [...] "Gareth Bale {{is the same}} sort of player as Serge. <b>He</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> ball on and works the full-back.

5000|$|... "Oshii's work... steers {{clear of}} such {{stereotypes}} in both image and sexual orientation," [...] wrote Andrez Bergen {{in an article}} on Oshii that appeared in Japan's Daily Yomiuri newspaper in 2004. [...] "His movies are dark, thought-provoking, minimalist diatribes with an underlying complexity; {{at the same time}} <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> perimeters of technology {{when it comes to the}} medium itself. Character design plays equitable importance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{stated that}} [...] "Mr. Columbus, who {{previously}} directed Adventures in Baby-Sitting and whose writing credits include Gremlins and The Goonies, sets up this idea well {{but has no}} idea where to stop. <b>He</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> films slender premise much too far, trying to work miraculous feats of self-improvement upon Johnny, his mother, Marie, and even Elvis himself." ...|$|E

"The late Prof. John Kaplan {{was fond}} of the {{following}} classroom hypothetical attempt,: A very bad person goes {{to the roof of}} a high-rise building, dragging a very heavy potted plant. <b>He</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> plant over the edge and down onto a crowded noontime street, but, by miraculous chance, it does not hit any person.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album 4½ stars and stated [...] "George Braith {{turned in his}} strongest record with Extension. Largely freed from the {{restraints}} of the dueling horns, Braith is able to explore the outer reaches of his music. He still remains grounded in soul-jazz -- any guitar-organ combo is bound to have soul-jazz roots -- but <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> music toward adventurous hard bop, often with rewarding results".|$|E
5000|$|The film {{mentions}} braking {{attempts by}} the first officer, when <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> rudder pedals after touchdown, but it shows {{his feet on the}} bottom of those rudder pedals. It is not possible to get any braking at all, unless the pilot pushes on the top of those pedals, even if there was hydraulic brake fluid available, which the film implies there wasn't. Both hydraulic systems were destroyed by the bullets fired from the gun in the cabin.|$|E
50|$|In the climax, Martha confronts Marcus {{and tries}} to kill him by {{wielding}} a meat cleaver as she chases {{him out of the}} apartment to an elevator.

When the long necklace she's wearing gets caught in the bars of the shaft, she's decapitated when <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> elevator button. The film ends with Marcus staring a pool of Martha's blood.|$|E
