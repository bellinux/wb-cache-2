25|$|Key {{features}} that were reportedly emphasised {{in the design}} process of the new aircraft were accessibility and survivability; the AMX {{had to be able}} to sustain a single failure to any onboard system without any performance degradation. To achieve this, key systems are duplicated and vital systems are protected; the use of cockpit armor was considered but ultimately discounted due to the expense involved. The detailed <b>definition</b> <b>phase</b> of the project was completed in March 1980.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1970, the Breguet-Dassault-Dornier TA501 was {{declared}} {{the winner of}} the competition. In February 1971, the project <b>definition</b> <b>phase</b> was formally completed and the integrated design team was formally set up at Saint-Cloud, Paris, France; that same month, a join Franco-German protocol was signed, launching the construction of four prototypes. In February 1972, the approval to proceed with full development was issued. In May 1972, the first project meeting was held in Bordeaux, at which the order for the four prototypes was formally placed. By November 1972, the project had passed its first mock-up review. Dassault was designated as the 'pilot' company for the project and possessed final authority on design and management decisions, this approach to project management has been claimed to have been a mostly efficient manner of running the program.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the project <b>definition</b> <b>phase</b> in May 1970, the concepts were reduced to two designs; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred, and the twin-seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred (this would become the Tornado). The aircraft was briefly called the Panavia Panther, and the project soon coalesced towards the two-seat option. In September 1971, the three governments signed an Intention to Proceed (ITP) document, at which point the aircraft was intended solely for the low-level strike mission, where it was viewed as a viable threat to Soviet defences in that role. It was at this point that Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff announced [...] "two-thirds of the fighting front line will be composed of this single, basic aircraft type".|$|E
