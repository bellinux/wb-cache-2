5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the <b>fan</b> experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the <b>fan</b> was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the <b>fan</b> blades and <b>fan</b> disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned <b>fan</b> blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{has been}} the {{centerpiece}} of a large <b>fan</b> community for the game that has continued to be active more than 10years after the game's release. Such <b>fan</b> communities include the Grim Fandango Network and the Department of Death, both of which include <b>fan</b> art and fiction in addition to other original content.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to official localizations, {{for example the}} one by CD Projekt for the Polish market, <b>fan</b> communities developed Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian <b>fan</b> translations of the game. When Interplay dropped support for Planescape: Torment after the official 1.1 patch, several not yet fixed bugs were corrected by <b>fan</b> created unofficial patches. Other mods add back items and quests omitted from {{the final version of}} the game or new features such as widescreen support.|$|E

5|$|Rotary <b>fan,</b> {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary <b>fan</b> with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the <b>fan</b> wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary <b>fan</b> {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary <b>fan</b> used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 <b>fan</b> {{features}} dovetailed <b>fan</b> blades {{which allows}} them to be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few <b>fan</b> blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fan</b> {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the <b>fan</b> diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the <b>fan</b> blades. The lower speed allows the <b>fan</b> blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5000|$|High-volume {{low-speed}} <b>fans</b> (HVLS <b>fans)</b> are large-diameter ceiling <b>fans</b> {{intended for}} large spaces such as warehouses and gymnasiums. These <b>fans</b> generally spin {{at a low}} speed and they use airfoil-style blades for optimized air movement. One {{of the most popular}} manufactures of HVLS <b>fans</b> is Big Ass <b>Fans.</b>|$|R

5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is the <b>fan,</b> as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their <b>fan</b> in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi (the sash). The <b>fan</b> is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the <b>fan</b> is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The <b>fan</b> may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E
5|$|Winnowing fan: Contemporary to {{the rotary}} air {{conditioning}} <b>fan</b> invented by Han dynasty mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) is a pottery tomb {{model of a}} crank-operated rotary winnowing <b>fan</b> from the Han Dynasty, used for separating chaff from grain. The winnowing <b>fan</b> was first described by the Tang Dynasty writer and linguist Yan Shigu (581–645), in his commentary on the Jijiupian dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned in a poem by the Song Dynasty artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. The earliest known drawn illustration of the winnowing <b>fan</b> comes from the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by Yuan dynasty inventor and politician Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).|$|E

Galatasaray <b>fans</b> attempted to provoke the Arsenal <b>fans</b> in the bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the <b>fans,</b> and moved the Galatasaray <b>fans</b> back towards the square.|$|R

5|$|An English <b>fan</b> {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney <b>fan</b> site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most <b>fan</b> translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
