5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external.

5|$|When {{subjected}} to <b>external</b> <b>forces,</b> like electrical fields, {{the shape of}} an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite-type compounds.|$|E

Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.|$|E

40|$|We study numerically the photon {{emission}} from a semiconductor microcavity containing N> 2 quantum wells {{under the influence}} of a periodic <b>external</b> <b>forcing.</b> The emission is determined by the interplay between <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> and internal interaction between the wells. While the <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> synchronizes the periodic motion, the internal interaction destroys it. The nonlinear term of the Hamiltonian supports the synchronization.

We discuss the dynamics of the system across this transition. Comment: To be appeared in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of <b>external</b> <b>forces.</b> These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the <b>external</b> <b>forces</b> (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

40|$|Keeping the {{formation}} of colloidal crystal under a centrifugal force in mind, we study the ordering of Brownian particles induced by a uniform <b>external</b> <b>force.</b> When the uniform <b>external</b> <b>force</b> is added, the particles move {{in the direction of}} the <b>external</b> <b>force</b> and the density of particles near walls becomes high. The ordering of particles starts on the walls, and successive ordering in bulk occurs near the walls. In bulk, both domains of the face-centered cubic structure and hexagonal close-packed structure appear.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{deals with}} effect of <b>external</b> <b>force</b> on the {{dynamics}} of mutually coupled self-excited oscillators. Self-excited oscillators with linear and non-linear coupling are considered. The phase-amplitude equations or Adler equations are obtained analytically in both cases with Krylov and Bogoliubov method of averaging and these equations are {{used to analyze the}} effect of <b>external</b> <b>force</b> on their synchronization dynamics. Computational results are obtained by numerical integrations to validate the analytical results. For linearly coupled oscillators, the effect of <b>external</b> <b>force</b> on synchronization are studied. For nonlinear coupling, it's shown that in-phase synchronization is not possible even if the coupling values are varied. Such a system is brought into synchronization with effect of <b>external</b> <b>force.</b> Also, for both cases, non-synchronized cases are brought into synchronization with the aid of <b>external</b> <b>force.</b> This work shows that, even small amplitude of external disturbances, can produce considerable effect on the synchronization dynamics of coupled systems and thus should be given due importance in practical scenario...|$|R
