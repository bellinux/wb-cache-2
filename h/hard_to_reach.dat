5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable water and electricity.|$|E

5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the valves, so {{there may be some}} reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|The native {{environment}} stayed relatively intact until settlers {{began to}} arrive in western Idaho in great numbers in the 1870s, and miners also were attracted by a gold strike at nearby Orofino, {{on the banks of}} the Clearwater River. Many of these emigrants set up dryland farms and ranches in the prairies surrounding the Potlatch River. Soil conditions generally improve as one travels southwards through the watershed, but there was a major drawback to growing crops in the southern part of the basin: the inaccessibility of water. Already scarce in the arid Potlatch River drainage, the river's water was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> because of the steep canyon it passes through in most of its lower course. Farmers were restricted to growing crops that did not require irrigation, and many of the lands that did not have access to abundant-enough water were relegated to pasture or hay producing status.|$|E

Industrial endoscopes (see fiberscope or borescope) are used for inspecting anything <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> such as jet engine interiors.

The people went to Borgo Scacciaventi for commerce and business, while the richest families started building their grand houses (palazzi) in the Borgo, and traders and artisans built their homes above their shops, which served, along with the porticoes in front, to protect their goods.|$|E
25|$|A {{big plus}} {{for the site}} {{selection}} for the Exposition organizers was favorable access by water. A naval review {{was to be a}} major feature of the Exposition.

25|$|The dating of {{the poems}} {{has been a source}} of lively {{scholarly}} argument for a long time, and firm conclusions are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach.</b> Lines from the Eddic poems sometimes appear in poems by known poets, but such evidence is difficult to evaluate. For example, Eyvindr skáldaspillir composed in the latter half of the 10th century, and he uses a couple of lines in his Hákonarmál which are also found in Hávamál. It is possible that he was quoting a known poem, but it is also possible that Hávamál, or at least the strophe in question, is the younger derivative work.|$|E
25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but {{that they were just}} badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has been <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E

500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E
500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself.

[...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template.

But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|E
