The people greet Koroghlu with delight..|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1978, {{as part of}} the Four Modernizations campaign, the Family Production Responsibility System was created, {{dismantling}} communes {{and giving}} agricultural production responsibility back to individual households. Households are now given crop quotas that they were required to provide to their collective unit in return for tools, draft animals, seeds, and other essentials. Households, which now lease land from their collectives, are free to use their farmland however they see fit as long as they meet these quotas. This <b>freedom</b> <b>has</b> given more power to individual families to meet their individual needs. In addition to these structural changes, the Chinese government also engages in irrigation projects (such as the Three Gorges Dam), runs large state farms, and encourages mechanization and fertilizer use.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of writing}} {{petitions}} asking the courts for <b>freedom</b> <b>has</b> been a practice within North America {{dating back to the}} late 1600s. Some of the first petitions for freedom were not directed at the courts, but to the various colonial joint stock companies, such as the Dutch West India Company, which operated in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic area. During the early importation of enslaved laborers, the West India Company had no strict laws governing their status and condition. Enslaved persons were allowed to marry and raise families as long as they continued to work for the company. In this regard, many early petitions were by slaves attempting to obtain freedom on behalf of their nuclear families. In the antebellum period, women slaves were instrumental in seeking freedom to protect their children.|$|E

25|$|Outside of his WWE work, Layfield is a {{financial}} analyst for Fox News. Within WWE, he was previously {{known by the}} ring name Bradshaw, and prior to that, the variations Justin Bradshaw and Blackjack Bradshaw (as half of The New Blackjacks with Blackjack Windham).

Layfield's main gimmick as JBL – a wealthy, big-mouthed, fiery-tempered businessman – was based on Layfield's real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor.

25|$|Religion is {{extremely}} important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. Bön is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana, which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China. During China's Cultural Revolution, nearly all Tibet's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards. A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious <b>freedom</b> <b>has</b> been granted– although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited. Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks.|$|E

Whatever the disagreement, to me he stood {{as the embodiment of}} freedom, not only in his own country, but throughout the world." [...] In the 1964 Great Canadian Flag Debate, Diefenbaker led the unsuccessful opposition to the Maple Leaf flag, which the Liberals pushed for after the rejection of Pearson's preferred design showing three maple leaves. Diefenbaker preferred the existing Canadian Red Ensign or another design showing symbols of the nation's heritage. He dismissed the adopted design, with a single red maple leaf and two red bars, as [...] "a flag that Peruvians might salute". At the request of Quebec Tory Léon Balcer, who feared devastating PC losses in the province at the next election, Pearson imposed closure, and the bill passed with the majority singing [...] "O Canada" [...] as Diefenbaker led the dissenters in [...] "God Save the Queen".|$|E
