40|$|Don Fuller and Eileen Cummings {{argue that}} in Australia the {{destruction}} of the previously productive Indigenous economic system has led, since the 1970 s in particular, to a dependence on <b>government</b> <b>services</b> and <b>programmes.</b> A number of researchers and practitioners have begun to question the implications of such dependence for the economic and human condition of Indigenous Australians. The authors maintain that a higher degree of economic equality needs to be achieved before many of the severe social problems, which also confront Indigenous Australians, can be properly addressed. An important constraint to improved economic equality lies in the unacceptably low educational outcomes and opportunities for business skills development for Indigenous Australians.

40|$|In recent years, {{research}} has focussed on the ‘neoliberalization’ of volunteering programmes {{in the developing}} South. Commonly cited processes include an uncritical pedagogy of development and a heavy emphasis on ‘difference making’ and curriculum vitae building. These neoliberalizing processes, research finds, have come to shape the affective and emotional experience of volunteers on placement. This article presents an alternative reading of the embodied experience of volunteering. Affect here is understood as autonomous and explored as a potential ‘outside’ to formations of power and neoliberalization. The discussion begins with a critical reading of the British <b>government’s</b> International Citizen <b>Service</b> <b>programme,</b> drawing out its neoliberalized construction of volunteers as ‘global citizens’. The article then moves on to present affective data from fieldwork carried out on International Citizen Service projects in India. The argument is made that neoliberalism need {{not be the only}} frame of analysis; volunteers experience rich inter-subjectivities that cannot (and should not) be easily attributed to processes of neoliberalization. The resulting account writes into being the affective life on placement as potentially autonomous of expressions of power and neoliberalization...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the effectiveness of}} e-government in developing countries towards improving public service delivery is littered with failure stories. Notwithstanding, the failures have not stopped most governments in developing countries from increasingly turning to ICT, most notably internet based models, as the preferred channel for citizen-centered service delivery. This paper investigated e-government within the developing country context of South Africa. We used the interpretive paradigm primarily because we wanted to increase our understanding of the phenomenon of e-government for public service delivery within the local South African context. The investigation focused on one of the <b>governments</b> primary <b>service</b> delivery <b>programmes</b> – social grants. The analysis of findings suggest that egovernment in South Africa is not aligned to the service delivery philosophy, Batho Pele, and is hence not effective in delivering on the public service delivery mandate. Batho Pele which literally means "people first" is similar to the UNDP Human Development Indicators for development. The contribution of this research can be extended to both practice and IS theory. The research highlights the need for ICT 4 D, particularly e-government in developing contexts, to firstly be aligned to the current over-arching government philosophies if they are to have any effective impact on service delivery. The practical contribution of the research is a possible framework {{that could be used to}} align e-government in South Africa to the <b>government</b> philosophy of <b>service</b> delivery...|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to assess community attitudes towards <b>service</b> <b>programme</b> for offenders. Specifically the study wanted to assess people‟s knowledge on community <b>service</b> <b>programme.</b> Explore community attitudes towards community <b>service</b> <b>programmes</b> and come up with recommendations on how to improve the programme. The study adopted a case study design and used both quantitative and qualitative methods to collect and analyze data. Data was collected from 64 respondents including 20 community service officers, 20 community service offenders, 20 community members and 4 resident magistrates using structured questionnaire and interviews methods. Microsoft Excel Software and thematic analysis were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data. Study findings suggest that: First, the majority 16 (27. 7 %) of community members was not aware of community <b>service</b> <b>programme.</b> Second, there is negative attitude of the community since most 17 (28. 3 %) of the community members argued that, it is, lenient as compared with imprisonment. Third, the majority 46 (76 %) of all respondents suggested that awareness raising campaigns and government allocation of more funding for community service department as strategies to improve the programme as an alternative sentence to imprisonment should be encouraged. From these findings, it can be concluded that, lack of awareness of community <b>service</b> <b>programme</b> contributes to negative attitudes towards community <b>service</b> <b>programme.</b> Moreover, the study findings can also suggest that, the government has not adequately disseminated education on community <b>service</b> <b>programme</b> Therefore, there is a need for, advocacy and awareness raising campaigns to be conducted by social workers and NGOs to eliminate negative attitudes on the pogramme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper was to review related {{literature}} on Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programme</b> and the involvement of librarians in such initiatives, with a focus on the University of Port Harcourt. This review was also undertaken to establish a link between the Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programme</b> and purposeful librarianship. Related literature was reviewed on the involvement of academic librarians in Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programme</b> in Universities with a focus on University of Port Harcourt Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programme.</b> It was observed that Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programmes</b> play an essential role in linking students with host communities and provide opportunities and prospects for the development of entrepreneurial skills. This paper highlighted the benefits of community service activities to all the stakeholders. It also exposed the problem of non-involvement of librarians in community service initiatives. This problem is more pronounced in Nigeria where librarians of all categories are not involved. It was, therefore, recommended that librarians should be actively involved in the design and implementation of the Community <b>Service</b> <b>Programme</b> in universities. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} town and gown, this paper also recommends the establishment of a functional Community Information Resource Centre with a library. This is a baseline review as no such paper has been written on this topic. Thus, it provides the basic information needed for further studies in this area...|$|R

40|$|Money {{helps people}} {{gain access to}} the goods and {{services}} they require and it allows people to make choices without having dependence on others (Boucher & Kofos, 2012). Prior research has shown that when the concept of money is activated, participants behave in a less pro-social but a more self-sufficient way in that while {{they are less likely to}} offer help to others or to donate money, they make more effort to complete a task and they prefer to work alone rather than to work collectively with others (Vohs, Mead & Goode, 2006). In this study, we examined the effect of money activation on the level of support for <b>government</b> goods and <b>services</b> <b>programmes</b> as a function of the type of programmes (welfare related or universal) and the participantʼs socioeconomic position (higher or lower). All participants performed a memory task before completing a <b>government</b> goods and <b>services</b> survey. The memory task consisted of either money-related words (for the money primed group) or neutral words not associated with money (for the control group). The results show that relative to the participants in the control group, those primed with money had lower levels of support for government programmes, and the effect was stronger for welfare related compared with universal programmes. No significant interaction between priming and socioeconomic status was found, although there was a trend that activating the concept of money had a larger effect for the higher socioeconomic group compared with the lower socioeconomic group. These results provided converging evidence to previous research that activating the concept of money could change peopleʼs attitudes and behaviours, inducing them to become less sensitive to othersʼ needs. Our results also extend the findings of prior research to the valuation of existing government programmes. They suggest that money activation could lower peopleʼs support for social policies, resulting in unintended consequences...|$|R

The purpose of this measure was {{to examine the relationship between}} entrepreneurs’ personality traits and their perceived SE performance. The results indicated that SE performance can be assessed using four dimensions: personal issues, social aspects, business elements, and <b>service</b> <b>programmes.</b> Extraversion positively influenced <b>service</b> <b>programmes,</b> and openness negatively affected <b>service</b> <b>programmes.</b> Neuroticism and conscientiousness positively predicted personal issues and <b>service</b> <b>programmes,</b> and agreeableness positively predicted all dimensions of perceived SE performance. The results also demonstrated the curvilinear relationship of the U-shaped curve between neuroticism and personal issues and the social aspects of SE performance. Furthermore, the results showed the curvilinear relationship of the inverted U-shaped curve between agreeableness and the four dimensions of SE performance...|$|R
