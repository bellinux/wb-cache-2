5|$|The chachalacas, <b>guans</b> and {{curassows}} are {{birds in}} the family Cracidae. These are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The <b>guans</b> and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some <b>guans</b> have colorful facial ornaments.|$|E

5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some <b>guans</b> (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
50|$|In Chapter 83, <b>Guan</b> Xing slew Pan Zhang, the {{commander}} of the division that previously captured <b>Guan</b> Yu. <b>Guan</b> Yu's ghost had made Pan Zhang freeze in fear, allowing <b>Guan</b> Xing to slay him. In doing so, <b>Guan</b> Xing retrieved his father's weapon, the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Later, when Mi Fang and Fu Shiren, two former Shu officers who defected to Sun Quan and ultimately caused the death of <b>Guan</b> Yu, surrendered to Liu Bei again, Liu Bei refused to forgive them and ordered <b>Guan</b> Xing to execute the pair before an altar dedicated to <b>Guan</b> Yu.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Guan</b> Yu had two known sons – <b>Guan</b> Ping and <b>Guan</b> Xing. <b>Guan</b> Xing {{inherited}} his father's title [...] "Marquis of Hanshou Village" [...] (漢壽亭侯) {{and served}} {{in the state of}} Shu during the Three Kingdoms period. <b>Guan</b> Yu also had a daughter. Sun Quan once proposed a marriage between his son and <b>Guan</b> Yu's daughter, but <b>Guan</b> rejected the proposal. Her name was not recorded in history, but she was known as [...] "Guan Yinping" [...] (關銀屏) or [...] "Guan Feng" [...] (關鳳) in folktales and Chinese opera. <b>Guan</b> Yu allegedly had a third son, <b>Guan</b> Suo, who is not mentioned in historical texts and appears only in folklore and the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.|$|R
50|$|Zhou Cang {{sometimes}} {{appears as}} a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, partnered with <b>Guan</b> Yu. He also sometimes accompanies <b>Guan</b> Yu {{in his role as}} a war god, together with his adopted son <b>Guan</b> Ping. Zhou's face is portrayed as coal black, in contrast to <b>Guan</b> Yu's red and <b>Guan</b> Ping's white.|$|R
25|$|Tinamous {{form one}} of the most {{terrestrial}} groups of flying birds, spending virtually all of their time on the ground. They walk silently, pausing frequently in mid-stride. When a potential threat is detected, a tinamou will typically freeze in one of two positions, either crouched or with its neck extended upwards. As far as possible, they will avoid resorting to flight by stealthy walking or running away from danger as well as by concealment in dense vegetation. They may then pause to observe the cause of their alarm from cover. They also hide in burrows. Their cryptic behavior has allowed them to survive or even thrive in areas where <b>guans</b> have been extirpated.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are {{exclusively}} neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The {{range of}} the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean tinamous have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, {{and in particular the}} Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. Tinamous form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the Galliformes ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. Rheas are only found in open country, curassows and <b>guans</b> are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.|$|E
25|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} consists {{mainly of}} mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{seems to have}} become a key prey item. The black-chested buzzard-eagle is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of the rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Among the native fauna degus (Octodon) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus) are important prey, but mammals as formidable as a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) – two to over three times as heavy as the birds and certainly not defenceless – are occasionally hunted and killed by this hawk. Its diet is rounded off with an occasional bird – including carnivorous species like the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and sizeable prey such as Penelope <b>guans</b> or the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) –, large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened. It is {{near the top of}} the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guan</b> Ping {{sometimes}} {{appears as}} a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in partnership with <b>Guan</b> Yu. He also sometimes accompanies <b>Guan</b> Yu {{in his role as}} a war god, sometimes in combination with Zhou Cang and Liao Hua. <b>Guan</b> Ping's face is traditionally painted white, while Zhou Cang is black and <b>Guan</b> Yu red.|$|R
5000|$|In folk tales, <b>Guan</b> Suo {{has another}} name—"Hua <b>Guan</b> Suo" [...] (花關索), which {{literally}} means [...] "Flower <b>Guan</b> Suo". It {{is said that}} <b>Guan</b> Suo used this name before he met his father <b>Guan</b> Yu. [...] "Hua" [...] was the family name of his martial arts master Hua Yue (花月/花岳) in Banshidong (班石洞), Mount Qiuqu (丘衢山).|$|R
50|$|Several weeks later, Sun Quan, who had {{secretly}} allied with Cao Cao, attacked <b>Guan</b> Yu's army at Jiangling. Sun Quan surprised and defeated <b>Guan</b> Yu's forces there, forcing <b>Guan</b> {{to lift the}} siege on Fancheng and retreat. <b>Guan</b> Yu and his son, <b>Guan</b> Ping, while fleeing to Yi Province (covering the Sichuan Basin), were caught and executed by Sun Quan's soldiers.|$|R
500|$|The ruins lie {{among the}} {{tropical}} rainforests of northern Guatemala {{that formed the}} cradle of lowland Maya civilization. The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils, and may have dominated a natural east–west trade route across the Yucatan Peninsula. Conspicuous trees at the Tikal park include gigantic kapok (Ceiba pentandra) the sacred tree of the Maya; tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata), and Honduras mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). Regarding the fauna, agoutis, white-nosed coatis, gray foxes, Geoffroy's spider monkeys, howler monkeys, harpy eagles, falcons, ocellated turkeys, <b>guans,</b> toucans, green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly. Jaguars, jaguarundis, and cougars are also said to roam in the park. For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle. The average annual rainfall at Tikal is [...]|$|E
2500|$|Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt using blowguns, with darts {{coated with}} curare [...] "manyi", a poison made from {{different}} plants (curares). They specially hunt {{several species of}} monkeys (Alouatta spp., Cebus spp., Saimiri sp., Lagothrix spp., Ateles sp., Saguinus spp., Callicebus torquatus), and birds (Muscovy duck, chachalacas, <b>guans,</b> curassows, grey-winged trumpeter and toucans). Also they use javelins of Socratea exorrhiza palm wood to hunt two species of peccaries (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) and spectacled caimans, whose eggs they consume too. Nukak neither hunt nor eat brocket deer, [...] Odocoileus virginianus and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris); these animals are considered by {{them as part of}} the same group of origin as human beings.|$|E
2500|$|In general, Chiapas has a humid, {{tropical}} climate. In the north, in {{the area}} bordering Tabasco, near Teapa, rainfall can average more than [...] per year. In the past, natural vegetation at this region was lowland, tall perennial rainforest, but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely {{to give way to}} agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the Pacific Ocean, but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near Tapachula. On the several parallel [...] "sierras" [...] or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy, allowing the development of cloud forests like those of the Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo, home to a handful of resplendent quetzals and horned <b>guans.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sun Quan {{asked for}} <b>Guan</b> Yu's {{surrender}} but <b>Guan</b> refused. On {{the advice of}} his followers and for fear that <b>Guan</b> Yu might pose a threat to him, Sun Quan eventually ordered <b>Guan</b> Yu, <b>Guan</b> Ping and Zhao Lei to be executed in Linju (臨沮). Liao Hua surrendered to Sun Quan but later faked his own death and escaped to rejoin Liu Bei.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>Guan</b> Yu and <b>Guan</b> Ping were {{intercepted by}} Sun Quan's forces and captured. Both were {{promptly}} executed. In Maicheng, Wang was telling Zhou Cang about {{a vision of}} blood-stained <b>Guan</b> Yu in a nightmare he had when enemy soldiers came to the city with the severed heads of <b>Guan</b> Yu and <b>Guan</b> Ping. With a cry, Wang then threw himself from the city walls and died.|$|R
50|$|Little {{information}} about <b>Guan</b> Xing {{is found in}} historical records. The biography of <b>Guan</b> Yu in the Records of the Three Kingdoms contains only a few lines on <b>Guan</b> Xing. In his youth, <b>Guan</b> Xing was knowledgeable, and Zhuge Liang saw him as an exceptional talent. When he reached adulthood (around 19 years old), he served as an official in Shu Han, but died some years later. His {{cause of death was}} not documented.

60|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} facts, as showing how susceptible to changed conditions or to slight constitutional changes are the reproductive powers of animals, is the very general difficulty of getting those which are kept in confinement to breed; and this is frequently the only bar to domesticating wild species. Thus, elephants, bears, foxes, and numbers of species of rodents, very rarely breed in confinement; while other species do so more or less freely. Hawks, vultures, and owls hardly ever breed in confinement; neither did the falcons kept for hawking ever breed. Of the numerous small seed-eating birds kept in aviaries, hardly any breed, neither do parrots. Gallinaceous birds usually breed freely in confinement, but some do not; and even the <b>guans</b> and curassows, kept tame by the South American Indians, never breed. This shows that change of climate {{has nothing to do with}} the phenomenon; and, in fact, the same species that refuse to breed in Europe do so, in almost every case, when tamed or confined in their native countries. This inability to reproduce is not due to ill-health, since many of these creatures are perfectly vigorous and live very long.|$|E
60|$|Gallinaceous {{birds of}} many genera {{likewise}} show an eminent capacity for breeding under captivity. This is particularly {{the case with}} pheasants, yet our English species seldom lays more than ten eggs in confinement; whilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the wild state. (18/48. Mowbray on 'Poultry' 7th edition page 133.) With the Gallinaceae, as with all other orders, there are marked and inexplicable exceptions {{in regard to the}} fertility of certain species and genera under confinement. Although many trials have been made with the common partridge, it has rarely bred, even when reared in large aviaries; and the hen will never hatch her own eggs. (18/49. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' etc. 1813 tome 3 pages 288, 382; 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 12 1843 page 453. Other species of partridge have occasionally bred; as the red-legged (P. rubra), when kept in a large court in France (see Journal de Physique' tome 25 page 294), and in the Zoological Gardens in 1856.) The American tribe of <b>Guans</b> or Cracidae are tamed with remarkable ease, but are very shy breeders in this country (18/50. Rev. E.S. Dixon 'The Dovecote' 1851 pages 243-252.); but with care various species were formerly made to breed rather freely in Holland. (18/51. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' etc. tome 2 pages 456, 458; tome 3 pages 2, 13, 47.) Birds of this tribe are often kept in a perfectly tamed condition in their native country by the Indians, but they never breed. (18/52. Bates 'The Naturalist on the Amazons' volume 1 page 193; volume 2 page 112.) It might have been expected that grouse from their habits of life would not have bred in captivity, more especially as they are said soon to languish and die. (18/53. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' etc. tome 2 page 125. For Tetrao urogallus see L. Lloyd 'Field Sports of North of Europe' volume 1 pages 287, 314; and Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 7 1860 page 600. For T. scoticus Thompson 'Nat. Hist. of Ireland' volume 2 1850 page 49. For T. cupido 'Boston Journal of Nat. Hist.' volume 3 page 199.) But many cases are recorded of their breeding: the capercailzie (Tetrao urogallus) has bred in the Zoological Gardens; it breeds without much difficulty when confined in Norway, and in Russia five successive generations have been reared: Tetrao tetrix has likewise bred in Norway; T. scoticus in Ireland; T. umbellus at Lord Derby's; and T. cupido in North America.|$|E
