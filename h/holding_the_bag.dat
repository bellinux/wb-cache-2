25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> in a pump and dump scheme, the case had gone {{all the way to}} the Supreme Court. In 1953 it had held in Wilko v. Swan that three provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where the burden of proof was on the seller of the security to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature of the security sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.|$|E

[...] Anna Smith of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals. But while the settings are impressively multidimensional, the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings." ...|$|E

25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if <b>the</b> lift <b>bag</b> or rigging fails <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> in <b>the</b> upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the redesign of equipment designed for drying bags {{that is used}} in Fresenius Kabis´ manufacturing of their nutrition medicine in Uppsala. The need of this task arise during {{the start of the}} development of a new packaging line were this equipment were meant to be used. An evaluation of the bagdryers capacity and capability was necessary. The work started with gathering of information from suppliers of the used components and from the responsible engineers for this equipment. An education to learn how the equipment worked and how to operate it were taken. That was followed by the creation of a study plan were the tests were planned to test different parameters effect on the drying result and to see if the bagdryer managed to handle <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> of <b>the</b> correct format in the pace that the equipment should be designed for. The test results detected a need of designing a unit with a function that <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> in place while passing through the dryer in order to attain high quality results. The results were later used for optimization of the design. The parameters that had the biggest effect on the result were the distance and the airflow. When the concepts were chosen the detailed design was initiated and the result of this is described in chapter 7 Resultat. Shortly, the result from the design work can be described as a unit that <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> in place while drying. The unit. s height is adjustable and the air knives tilting angle and height can also be adjusted. With this unit installed, the equipment will be able to meet the new capacity demand which is set on it. Continued work on the design is recommended in order to reduce the designs weight and to verify that the design is strong enough...|$|R
