40|$|<b>The</b> second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'long <b>nineteenth</b> century' {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic increase}} of strikes all over Europe, which was not confined within national boundaries. Historical strike research has mainly analyzed strike-related transnationalism by doing comparative studies and examining international strike waves. This article offers a second approach towards a transnational history <b>of</b> striking: <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> strike-related transnational entanglements. By <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> strikes in Switzerland, it focuses on three aspects and asks about their geographical dimensions, their impact on <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> local strikes as well as <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> these strikes on <b>the</b> further transnationalization <b>of</b> industrial relations: strike-induced migration; <b>the</b> transnational collection <b>of</b> donations for strikers; and border-crossing organizational cooperation both of trade unions and employers. <b>The</b> catchment area <b>of</b> these transnational entanglements covered large parts of Europe. Whilst transnational donations, being important both financially and symbolically, experienced their heyday between the 1860 s and the 1890 s, several forms <b>of</b> migration, including <b>the</b> border-crossing recruitment <b>of</b> strike-breakers and <b>the</b> deportation <b>of</b> foreign strikers, took place over the whole period considered and were in some cases crucial for <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> strikes. These forms of migration were especially important in causing <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> transnational mechanisms of cooperation between both trade unions and employers organizations between the 1890 s and 1914. On balance, the Swiss case uncovers a potentially very productive field of analysis for renewed historical strike research, which fits perfectly well into a transnational labour history inspired by <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> "istoire croisée"...|$|R

Many concepts that originated with von Martens are still (as of 2017) in use.|$|E
5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity in the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking.

5|$|The {{history of}} Brasenose College, Oxford {{stretches}} back to 1509, when the college {{was founded on}} the site of Brasenose Hall.

The college was associated with Lancashire and Cheshire, the county origins of its two founders– Sir Richard Sutton and the Bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth– a link that was maintained strongly until the latter <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. The first principals navigated Brasenose, with its Catholic sympathisers, through the reformation and continuing religious reforms. Most of Brasenose favoured the Royalist side during the English Civil War, although it produced notable generals and clergy on both sides. The library and chapel were completed in the mid-seventeenth century, despite Brasenose suffering continuing financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during the latter <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so {{the social and political}} views of newcomers could be reconciled with either.

5|$|Lion taming {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness {{in the early twentieth century}} with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).|$|E

For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi).

5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{originated}} from the loose Flemish Movement, which historically has included {{an array of}} organisations seeking, to varying degrees, to promote Flanders. In the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Flemish nationalists operated within the established political parties, and had close ties with the political left. The early organised political expression of Flemish nationalism was triggered by World War I, {{and the introduction of}} universal suffrage and proportional representation in elections. The main party that initially represented the movement was the left-wing nationalist Front Party, founded by former soldiers and sympathizers from the trench wars in Flanders Fields disaffected with their French-speaking, often anti-Flemish, officers that had been unable to communicate with their troops. From the 1930s, the main party became the Flemish National Union which turned to collaborate with the Nazis during World War II, as they had promised them increased Flemish autonomy. These circumstances would compromise the re-emergence of Flemish nationalism after the war, although only a faction of the broader movement had actually pursued an agenda of collaboration.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during the latter <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century.
