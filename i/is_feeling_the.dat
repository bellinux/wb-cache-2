25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> same thing.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it.

2500|$|The Sydney Morning Herald, a broadsheet, characterised the {{campaign}} as [...] "undistinguished" [...] and the rival leaders as [...] "lacklustre". Its editorial focussed on Labor's record {{over the past}} 12 years: [...] "New South Wales <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> effects of ... second-rateism. It languishes near the bottom on the states' economic league table," [...] the paper wrote. The Herald also criticised [...] "the politicisation of the public service" [...] and a state government [...] "addicted to secrecy". [...] "It is, we admit, an uninspiring choice for voters," [...] the Herald concluded, however [...] "We believe the re-election of Labor is simply one risk too many." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends in Deed, {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> best that he has felt all year.

The result will be--now Miss Silvester has gone--that Bishopriggs will return to Craig Fernie before the autumn is over. We are sailing with wind and tide, my dear.

60|$|Of the {{prospect}} of progress in philosophy, it would be rash to speak with confidence. Many of the traditional problems of philosophy, perhaps most of those which have interested a wider circle than that of technical students, {{do not appear to}} be soluble by scientific methods. Just as astronomy lost much of its human interest when it ceased to be astrology, so philosophy must lose in attractiveness as it grows less prodigal of promises. But to the large and still growing body of men engaged in the pursuit of science--men who hitherto, not without justification, have turned aside from philosophy with a certain contempt--the new method, successful already in such time-honoured problems as number, infinity, continuity, space and time, should make an appeal which the older methods have wholly failed to make. Physics, with its principle of relativity and its revolutionary investigations into the nature of matter, <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> need for that kind of novelty in fundamental hypotheses which scientific philosophy aims at facilitating. The one and only condition, I believe, which is necessary in order to secure for philosophy in the near future an achievement surpassing all that has hitherto been accomplished by philosophers, is the creation of a school of men with scientific training and philosophical interests, unhampered by the traditions of the past, and not misled by the literary methods of those who copy the ancients in all except their merits.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{not only}} twin-souls in this world who yearn to meet each other. Between Otis Pilkington and Mr. Goble there was little in common, yet, {{at the moment when}} Otis set out to find Mr. Goble, the thing which Mr. Goble desired most in the world was an {{interview}} with Otis. Since {{the end of the first}} act, the manager had been in a state of mental upheaval. Reverting to the gold-mine simile again, Mr. Goble was in the position of a man who has had a chance of purchasing such a mine and now, learning too late of the discovery of the reef, <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> truth of the poet's dictum that [...] "of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: 'It might have been.'" [...] The electric success of [...] "The Rose of America" [...] had stunned Mr. Goble; and realizing, as he did, that he might have bought Otis Pilkington's share dirt cheap at almost any point of the preliminary tour, he was having a bad half hour with himself. The only ray in the darkness which brooded on his indomitable soul was the thought that it might still be possible, by getting hold of Mr. Pilkington before the notices appeared, and shaking his head sadly and talking about the misleading hopes which young authors so often draw from an enthusiastic first-night reception and impressing upon him that first-night receptions do not deceive your expert who has been fifteen years in the show-business and mentioning gloomily that he had heard a coupla the critics roastin' the show to beat the band ... by doing all these things, it might still be possible to depress Mr. Pilkington's young enthusiasm and induce him to sell his share at a sacrifice price to a great-hearted friend who didn't think the thing would run a week but was willing to buy as a sporting speculation, because he thought Mr. Pilkington a good kid, and after all these shows that flop in New York sometimes have a chance on the road.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR SIR HUGO--Since we {{came home}} the {{marriage}} has been absolutely [...] decided on, and {{is to take}} place in less than three weeks. It is so [...] far the worse for him that her mother has lately lost all her fortune, [...] and he will have to find supplies. Grandcourt, I know, <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> [...] want of cash; and unless some other plan is resorted to, he will be [...] raising money in a foolish way. I am going to leave Diplow [...] immediately, and I shall not be able to start the topic. What I should [...] advise is, that Mr. Deronda, who I know has your confidence, should [...] propose to come and pay a short visit here, according to invitation [...] (there are going to be other people in the house), and that you should [...] put him fully in possession of your wishes and the possible extent of [...] your offer. Then, that he should introduce the subject to Grandcourt [...] so as not to imply that you suspect any particular want of money on [...] his part, but only that there is a strong wish on yours, What I have [...] formerly said to him has been {{in the way of a}} conjecture that you [...] might be willing to give a good sum for his chance of Diplow; but if [...] Mr. Deronda came armed with a definite offer, that would take another [...] sort of hold. Ten to one he will not close for some time to come; but [...] the proposal will have got a stronger lodgment in his mind; and though [...] at present he has a great notion of the hunting here, I see a [...] likelihood, under the circumstances, that he will get a distaste for [...] the neighborhood, and there will be the notion of the money sticking [...] by him without being urged. I would bet on your ultimate success. As I [...] am not to be exiled to Siberia, but am to be within call, it is [...] possible that, by and by, I may be of more service to you. But at [...] present I can think of no medium so good as Mr. Deronda. Nothing puts [...] Grandcourt in worse humor than having the lawyers thrust their paper [...] under his nose uninvited.|$|E
6000|$|... 26. In one sense, modern Art {{has more}} {{goodness}} in it than ever Art had before. Its kindly spirit, its quick sympathy with pure domestic and social feeling, the occasional seriousness of its instructive purpose, and its honest effort {{to grasp the}} reality of conceived scenes, are all eminently [...] "good," [...] {{as compared with the}} insane picturesqueness and conventional piety of many among the old masters. Such domestic painting, for instance, as Richter's in Germany, Edward Frere's in France, and Hook's in England, together with such historical and ideal work as----perhaps the reader would be offended with me were I to set down the several names that occur to me here, so I will set down one only, and say--as that of Paul de la Roche; such work, I repeat, as these men have done, or are doing, is entirely good in its influence on the public mind; and may, in thankful exultation, be compared with the renderings of besotted, vicious, and vulgar human life perpetrated by Dutch painters, or with the deathful formalism and fallacy of what was once called [...] "Historical Art." [...] Also, this gentleness and veracity of theirs, being in part communicable, are gradually learned, though in a somewhat servile manner, yet not without a sincere sympathy, by many inferior painters, so that our exhibitions and currently popular books are full of very lovely and pathetic ideas, expressed with a care, and appealing to an interest, quite unknown in past times. I will take two instances of merely average power, as more illustrative of what I mean than any more singular and distinguished work could be. Last year, in the British Institution, there were two pictures by the same painter, one of a domestic, the other of a sacred subject. I will say nothing {{of the way in which}} they were painted; it may have been bad, or good, or neither: it is not to my point. I wish to direct attention only to the conception of them. One, [...] "Cradled in his Calling," [...] was of a fisherman and his wife, and helpful grown-up son, and helpless new-born little one; the two men carrying the young child up from the shore, rocking it between them in the wet net for a hammock, the mother looking on joyously, and the baby laughing. The thought was pretty and good, and one might go on dreaming over it long--not unprofitably. But the second picture was more interesting. I describe it only in the circumstances of the invented scene--sunset after the crucifixion. The bodies have been taken away, and the crosses are left lying on the broken earth; a group of children have strayed up the hill, and stopped beside them in such shadowy awe as is possible to childhood, and they have picked up one or two of the drawn nails to feel how sharp they are. Meantime a girl with her little brother--goat-herds both--have been watering their flock at Kidron, and are driving it home. The girl, strong in grace and honor of youth, carrying her pitcher of water on her erect head, has gone on past the place steadily, minding her flock; but her little curly-headed brother, with cheeks of burning Eastern brown, has lingered behind to look, and <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> point of one of the nails, held in another child's hand. A lovely little kid of the goats has stayed behind to keep him company, and is amusing itself by jumping backwards and forwards over an arm of the cross. The sister looks back, and, wondering what he can have stopped in that dreadful place for, waves her hand for the little boy to come away.|$|E
