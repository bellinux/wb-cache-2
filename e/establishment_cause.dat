5000|$|Sandra Day O’Connor was {{unpredictable}} {{in many of}} her court decisions, {{especially those}} regarding First Amendment <b>Establishment</b> <b>Cause</b> issues. This {{might be due to}} the fact that instead of letting herself be guided by her conservative ideologies, she decided on a case-by-case basis and voted with careful deliberation in a way that she felt benefited individual rights and the Constitution (which she viewed to be “an ever changing work in progress.”) Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said, “O’Connor was a conservative, but she saw the complexity of church-state issues and tried to choose a course that respected the country’s religious diversity” (Hudson 2005). O’Connor voted in favor of religious institutions, such as in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, Mitchell v. Helms, and Rosenberger v. University of Virginia. Conversly, in Lee v. Weisman she was part of the majority in the case that saw religious prayer and pressure to stand in silence at a graduation ceremony as part of a religious act that coerced people to support/participate in religion, which is strictly prohibited by the Establishment Clause. This is consistent with a similar case, Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, involving prayer at a school football game. In this case O’Connor joined the majority opinion that stated prayer at school football games violates the Establishment Clause (Oyez, 2016). O'Connor was the first justice to articulate the [...] "no endorsement" [...] standard for the Establishment Clause. In Lynch v. Donnelly, O'Connor wrote for a 5-4 majority that a nativity scene in a public Christmas display did not violate the First Amendment because it was not expressing an endorsement or disapproval of any religion.|$|E

Faced with this outcome, Carol chose to back the antisemitic National Christian Party (PNC) of Octavian Goga and A. C.

In this study swoC 1 {{was shown to}} have defects in endocytosis, compartmentation, nuclear distribution, and conidiation. Temperature-shift experiments showed that the swoC 1 mutant establishes multiple random sites of germ tube emergence.

The swoC gene was mapped to the centromere of chromosome III and cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype.

However, neither rRNA pseudouridine synthesis nor rRNA processing appears to be affected in the swoC 1 mutant. The swoC 1 mutation occurs in the putative RNA-binding domain upstream of the C terminus, leaving the N-terminal TRUB catalytic domain intact.

The exposure of pea plants to increasing Cd concentrations (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 5. 0 µM) during early stages of their <b>establishment</b> <b>caused</b> a gradual decrease in shoot and root fresh weight accumulation, the rate of CO 2 fixation and the activity of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPC, E.

In vivo the excess of Cd induced alterations in the redox cycling of oxygen evolving centers and the assimilatory capacity of the pea leaves as revealed by {{the changes in the}} thermoluminescense emission after flash illumination. Seed pretreatment with SA alleviated the negative effect of Cd on growth, photosynthesis, carboxylation reactions, thermoluminescence characteristics and chlorophyll content and led to a decrease in the oxidative injuries caused by Cd.

40|$|In the {{northern}} part of Bangladesh a large proportion of land is medium and low-lying which are subjected to the risk of flooding from heavy rains during the month of August and September. Consecutive days of heavy rains after the crop <b>establishment</b> <b>causes</b> flash floods leading to death of seedlings and additional costs for re-transplanting. In response to this environmental problem, farmers practice a system of double transplanting of rice, locally known as Bolon to avoid crop failure from submergence. One-month old seedlings are transferred to another field with dense transplanting, and then re-transplanted to the main after the risk of flash flood is over. Scientists argue that the system would have lower yield and higher costs, thereby lower profits compared to single transplanting, but farmers disagree. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess economic performance of the Bolon system compared to the normal transplanting. Primary data were generated from 200 farmers drawn randomly from five sites to test the hypothesis that Bolon is less profitable and technically less efficient method of crop establishment compared to single transplanting. A stochastic frontier production function model was used to measure the difference in technical efficiency of the two systems. Results show although rice cultivation through Bolon involved higher cost particularly for double land preparation and transplanting of seedlings, but rice yield as well as net return was higher compared to single transplanting. The estimate of tech nical efficiency shows the farmers practicing the Bolon system are more efficient.

40|$|The {{long-term}} (10 – 100 years) {{evolution of}} tidal channels {{is generally considered}} {{to interact with the}} bio-geomorphic evolution of the surrounding intertidal platform. Here we studied how the geometric properties of tidal channels (channel drainage density and channel width) change as (1) vegetation establishes on an initially bare intertidal platform and (2) sediment accretion on the intertidal platform leads to a reduction in the tidal prism (i. e. water volume that during a tidal cycle floods to and drains back from the intertidal platform). Based on a time series of aerial photographs and digital elevation models, we derived the channel geometric properties at different time steps during the evolution from an initially low-elevated bare tidal flat towards a high-elevated vegetated marsh. We found that vegetation <b>establishment</b> <b>causes</b> a marked increase in channel drainage density. This is explained as the friction exerted by patches of pioneer vegetation concentrates the flow in between the vegetation patches and promotes there the erosion of channels. Once vegetation has established, continued sediment accretion and tidal prism reduction do not result in significant further changes in channel drainage density and in channel widths. We hypothesize that this is explained by a partitioning of the tidal flow between concentrated channel flow, as long as the vegetation is not submerged, and more homogeneous sheet flow as the vegetation is deeply submerged. Hence, a reduction of the tidal prism due to sediment accretion on the intertidal platform, reduces especially the volume of sheet flow (which does not affect channel geometry), while the concentrated channel flow (i. e. the landscape forming volume of water) is not much affected by the tidal prism reduction...|$|R

The hydrogeological-hydrogeochemical interdisciplinary approach of this study allowed to define the hydrostructural, piezometric and hydrochemical-isotopic characteristics of the phreatic aquifer as well as to assess the relationship between groundwater and superficial water and their seawater contamination. The hydrostratigraphic study let us to individuate a phreatic aquifer, 20 - 40 thick, characterized by sandy and sandy-silty deposits.

Grassland <b>establishment</b> <b>caused</b> a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128 ± 23 % and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116 ± 54 %, 100 years after LUC (mean± 95 % confidence interval).

Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0. 38 ± 0. 04 Mgha- 1 yr- 1 in afforestations adding up to 38 ± 4 Mgha- 1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (- 32 ± 20 %) and grassland conversion to cropland (- 36 ± 5 %), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively.
