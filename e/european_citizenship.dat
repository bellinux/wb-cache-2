25|$|In 1948, most of {{the villagers}} {{remained}} {{in the area and}} were joined by several refugees from al-Birwa. Some residents of Majd al-Krum settled in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon.

25|$|Sport {{is mainly}} the {{responsibility}} of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was {{at the core of the}} Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b>|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the {{research}} conducted during the project, this policy brief assesses {{the current status of}} the civil right of free movement as the anchor of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship.</b> In democracies, freedom of movement is a core civil right and a privilege of citizens. The European Union is no exception: the nationals of the European Union member states, as European Union citizens, have the right to move and reside in any other member state, and when they do, they should be treated like the nationals of their host states. This mobility and equal treatment paradigm of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship,</b> however, is under growing pressure. As the economic crisis hit hard, in particular in Eastern and Southern European states, their people moved to more wealthy European Union states, where they hoped to find work or ways of making a living. Meanwhile, citizens in Western and Northern Europe worried about what they perceived as increased competition for work and social benefits. Terrorist threats, the refugee crisis, and the rise of far-right, anti-foreigners and anti-European Union parties further challenge the unrestricted mobility basis of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship.</b> If mobility no longer constitutes the ‘substance’ of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship,</b> then what could replace it? One possible solution is to shift the basis of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship</b> from mobility to rights, and rebuild it around the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. Such a transformation would flesh up what has so far been criticized as a thin citizenship. This policy brief evaluates the current status of the right to free movement as the anchor of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship,</b> and develops two main scenarios for the future of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship,</b> one based on the current paradigm of mobility and the other based on rights. It then offers a range of policy options, which seek to preserve mobility, as the more likely, although perhaps not the most desirable, basis for the future development of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the position and}} agency of Romani migrants. It argues that different states often irregularize the status of Romani migrants even in cases {{where it should be}} regularized due to their de jure citizenship. This irregularization is possible because of their position as semi-citizens in their states of origin 2 ̆ 7. Yet, Romani migrants are not mere passive observers of these practices, but react to their irregularized migrant statuses. In doing so, they redefine their national and <b>European</b> <b>citizenships.</b> This article centres around two case studies to analyse the position and agency of Romani migrants The first is Roma with <b>European</b> Union (EU) <b>citizenship</b> and the second is post-Yugoslav Roma without EU citizenship...|$|R
25|$|Cross-national {{empirical}} verification, or rejection, of populist {{suspicion and}} fear of refugees' {{threat to national security}} and terror-related activities is relatively scarce. Case studies suggest that the threat of an Islamist refugee Trojan House is highly exaggerated. Of the 800,000 refugees vetted through the resettlement program in the United States between 2001 and 2016, only five were subsequently arrested on terrorism charges; and 17 of the 600,000 Iraqis and Syrians who arrived in Germany in 2015 were investigated for terrorism.

25|$|The EU traces {{its origins}} from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The {{original}} members of {{what came to}} be known as the European Communities, were the Inner Six; Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The Communities and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. While no member state has left the EU or its antecedent organisations, the United Kingdom enacted the result of a membership referendum in June 2016 and is currently negotiating its withdrawal. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The federal Naturalization Act, {{signed into}} law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated that {{immigrants}} to the United States had to be White according to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of Whiteness differed greatly from White Society's informal definition, thus Jews, Gypsies, Middle Eastern Peoples {{and those of the}} Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Gypsies, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held <b>European</b> <b>Citizenship.</b> The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Mediterranean and Slavic Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56–191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn't until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951. Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law, but this classification did not prevent informal discrimination against them by Anglo-Americans.|$|E

40|$|Based on 18 {{months of}} ethnographic {{fieldwork}} conducted between 2003 and 2006 {{in the border}} cities of Slubice, Poland and Frankfurt(Oder), Germany, this dissertation is {{an examination of the}} meanings and practices of the <b>European</b> Union's transnational <b>citizenship</b> policies. By documenting the everyday negotiations, interactions, and reflections of life on the Polish-German border, this study chronicles both the successes and failures of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship</b> at the local level, and focuses particularly on how various social groups experience <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship</b> in disparate ways, how the performance of citizenship contributes to the formation of transnational public spaces and identities, and how the tension between the legal and cultural elements of <b>European</b> Union <b>citizenship</b> profoundly structures local citizenship practice. The key intervention of this study is the observation that even as European Union policies aimed at creating deterritorialized economic, social, and political spaces expand supranational citizenship rights and privileges, hierarchies of value embedded within these policies grant rights differentially to individuals and groups in ways that are often linked to ethnicity and nationality. This dissertation therefore argues that despite European Union policymakers' efforts to create a hybridized "European" identity that might transcend historical conflicts and divisions, the processes they are using to pursue this goal are simultaneously generating new forms of difference and inequality...|$|R
500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, in {{the context}} of the {{preparation}} of his electoral campaign and in the wider context of the final governmental drafting of the text, he led the foundation of the European Green Party in Rome.

Cohn-Bendit described the European Green Party as the first stone of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> but other commentators described this new structure as a mere adaptation of the former Federation of European Green Parties. Just as in the former structure, only delegates from national parties were allowed to vote, individual supporters were only entitled to receive information, and all other federations of European parties had to adapt their statuses later in 2004 to the new regulations from the European Commission about European political parties, in order to continue receive public funding.
