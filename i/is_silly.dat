25|$|Finally, {{though not}} an {{approach}} investigating {{some kind of}} rules, there is a criticism by James M. Buchanan, Charles Plott, and others. It argues that it <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> {{to think that there}} might be social preferences that are analogous to individual preferences. Arrow (1963, Chapter 8) answers this sort of criticism seen in the early period, which come at least partly from misunderstanding.|$|E
500|$|Fundamental to Voltaire's {{attack is}} Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed {{follower}} of Leibniz {{and a teacher}} of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect: ...|$|E

So I put on a boy's bathing-suit under my dress--and--I'm terribly embarrassed." ...|$|R

500|$|The song {{received}} {{criticism as}} well. Jane Stevenson of Jam! wrote: [...] "In the minus category <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> lead-off track 'Senorita', which suffers from being too cute {{and has an}} awful call-and-answer ending featuring 'the guys and the ladies.'" [...] A music contributor from the Daily Free Press reported that The Neptunes appeared to have [...] "recycled beats from their N.E.R.D. project" [...] for Justified and that [...] "Señorita" [...] sounded like N.E.R.D.'s song, [...] "Run to the Sun".|$|E
500|$|Moyler {{felt that}} the {{combination}} of [...] "I Can't Go for That" [...] and [...] "You Make My Dreams" [...] was [...] "an abomination" [...] and [...] "New Directions at their worst". He summarized: [...] "The outfits are hokey, the dance <b>is</b> <b>silly,</b> and the music has absolutely no emotion in it." [...] Slezak, however, issued the performance an [...] "A–" [...] grade, and wrote, [...] "The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle, but I loved the frothy, silly spirit of this number, with the guys dressed like Miami Vice extras, Puck and Blaine rocking Oatestaches, and Tina getting a little moment on lead vocals." [...] Votta characterized the performance as a [...] "fun, retro number", and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was similarly pleased, and gave it a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Theatre {{historian}} John Bush Jones {{wrote that}} Pinafore has [...] "everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [...] has a score that... {{has plenty of}} tunes for the audience to go away humming". Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that {{the secret of the}} success of the Savoy operas is the way in which [...] "Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment." [...] Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on [...] "mirth and silliness". Even the title of the piece <b>is</b> <b>silly,</b> applying the name of a little girl's garment, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like Victory, Goliath, Audacious and Minotaur.|$|E

In the infancy of our {{language}} to be [...] "foolish" [...] signified to be affectionate; to be [...] "fond" [...] <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>silly.</b> We have altered that now: to be [...] "foolish" [...] <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>silly,</b> to <b>be</b> [...] "fond" [...] {{is to be}} affectionate.

500|$|Negative {{evaluations}} {{condemned the}} film's plot, acting, and screenplay. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times groused that [...] "perhaps movies are like history, and repeat themselves, first as tragedy, then as farce." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews stressed that [...] "the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention {{in order to}} work on any level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today groused on how [...] that [...] "there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [...] simply provokes disgust." [...] Justine Elias of The Village Voice asserted that [...] "this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders." [...] David Grove of Film Threat stated that [...] " [...] wasn’t much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> and illogical." [...] Jeff Vice of Deseret News censured to [...] "not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances"; while Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly reviled [...] "everything else about the film is also deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Winnipeg Free Press, Brad Oswald {{reviewed}} the show cautiously, writing {{it that is}} [...] "decidedly different, distinctly weird and definitely-an-acquired-taste kind of great" [...] and that some characters and scenes [...] "are edgy and uncompromising and sure to shock and offend nearly as many viewers as they amuse." [...] In the Toronto Star Raju Mudhar wrote that the [...] "humour is classic Kids, with plenty of visual gags mixed with off-colour, politically incorrect jokes" [...] and that [...] "the troupe's eye for satire remains sharp as ever". John Doyle in The Globe and Mail wrote a negative review concluding it was [...] "a dismal coda to the comedy troupe's outstanding career". Doyle identified himself as {{a fan of the}} original The Kids in the Hall series but found that this show had [...] "excruciatingly awful attempts at humour" [...] and [...] "no comic rhythm". Doyle called it [...] "appallingly slow-witted TV", [...] "mediocre and maddeningly pointless". In the Times-Colonist, Alex Strachan provided a qualified positive review writing that it was [...] "juvenile, sophomoric and deliberately unsophisticated" [...] but [...] "a joy to watch". Strachan concludes that [...] "Death Comes to Town is easy to dismiss as being lightweight, which it is, and scattershot, which it is. There's a genuine joie de vivre at work, though. Death Comes to Town <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> comedy for smart people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jake Wilson of The Sydney Morning Herald gave a more mixed review, {{judging the}} film to have a [...] "gimmicky script by {{newcomer}} Benjamin August that borrows heavily from Christopher Nolan's Memento." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times also wrote [...] "Remember benefits mightily from a quietly commanding Christopher Plummer performance that almost makes you forget the wonky plot logic." [...] Richard Roeper panned the film as [...] "bold but often ludicrous." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety also disapproved, writing the film [...] "puts a creditably sincere spin on material that <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> at best. At worst, tyro writer Benjamin August’s screenplay is a crass attempt to fashion a Memento-style puzzle narrative from post-Holocaust trauma." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yulia made {{headlines}} in Russia {{with a recent}} interview where she expressed her opinion on Lena's solo career, [...] "She [...] {{has the right to}} do it , but it's so stupid, absolutely stupid. If you do a solo career, it means that you do your own work. Her stuff, that she makes, I think, <b>is</b> <b>silly</b> and very soon her career will wither away and disappear." [...] Lena responded to this interview via her YouTube Page, [...] "I saw Yulia's interview. Of course I got upset. But I want to tell everybody that I have a completely opposite attitude towards the whole situation, Yulia's project included. I believe she's a very talented person and I sincerely hope that she'll be successful in all the things she plans." ...|$|E
