5|$|Much {{like other}} moons of Uranus, {{the surface of}} Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons {{trending}} northeast–southwest. They are not, however, officially recognized due to the poor imaging resolution and generally bland appearance of this moon, which hinders <b>geological</b> <b>mapping.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Geological</b> <b>mapping</b> of {{the volcano}} has {{indicated}} {{that as much as}} 80% {{of the volcano}}'s surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed <b>geological</b> <b>mapping</b> of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, made the connection between this and the earlier finds and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a <b>Geological</b> <b>Map,</b> together with the nation's first <b>geological</b> <b>map,</b> which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a <b>geological</b> structure <b>map</b> of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale <b>geological</b> <b>maps</b> included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this <b>map</b> in the <b>Geological</b> Magazine in 1873. Gray’s <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several <b>geological</b> <b>maps</b> of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the <b>geological</b> <b>map</b> of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|R
5|$|The only {{close-up}} {{images of}} Ariel {{were obtained by}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. The closest approach of Voyager 2 to Ariel was —significantly less than the distances to all other Uranian moons except Miranda. The best images of Ariel have a spatial resolution of about 2km. They cover about 40% of the surface, but only 35% was photographed with the quality required for <b>geological</b> <b>mapping</b> and crater counting. At {{the time of the}} flyby the southern hemisphere of Ariel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system, and no mission to Uranus and its moons is planned. The possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft to Uranus was evaluated during its mission extension planning phase. It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn, and these plans were scrapped in favour of remaining at Saturn and eventually destroying the spacecraft in Saturn's atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of online <b>geological</b> <b>maps</b> is hindered by linguistic barriers. Multilingual geoscience thesauri alleviate linguistic barriers of <b>geological</b> <b>maps.</b> However, {{the benefits of}} multilingual geoscience thesauri for online <b>geological</b> <b>maps</b> are less studied. In this regard, we developed a multilingual thesaurus of geological time scale (GTS) to alleviate linguistic barriers of GTS records among online <b>geological</b> <b>maps.</b> We extended the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) model to represent the ordinal hierarchical structure of GTS terms. We collected GTS terms in seven languages and encoded them into a thesaurus by using the extended SKOS model. We implemented methods of characteristic-oriented term retrieval in JavaScript programs for accessing Web Map Services (WMS), recognizing GTS terms, and making translations. With the developed thesaurus and programs, {{we set up a}} pilot system to test recognitions and translations of GTS terms in online <b>geological</b> <b>maps.</b> Results of this pilot system proved the accuracy of the developed thesaurus and the functionality of the developed programs. Therefore, with proper deployments, SKOS-based multilingual geoscience thesauri can be functional for alleviating linguistic barriers among online <b>geological</b> <b>maps</b> and, thus, improving their interoperability...|$|R
