5|$|Logan informs Veronica {{about the}} sex tape {{of her and}} Piz and hands her a DVD, {{although}} she berates him and denies that the recording is authentic. She views the tape and goes to visit Piz, who is badly bruised. She makes sure that Piz did not upload the footage to the internet, which he confirms. After learning that Logan had attacked Piz, Parker visits Logan's hotel room and tearfully breaks up with him, claiming that he still loves Veronica. Veronica goes to Logan's hotel room and berates him for attacking Piz. She confronts Dick {{about the origins of}} the sex tape, and he reveals that he got it from Chip Diller before forwarding it to his whole address book. She investigates further before encountering a student who refuses to tell <b>her</b> <b>anything.</b> She gets Weevil to destroy the student's car, and he names the individual, whom she later wiretaps.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Rebecca {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. During the arrest and trial, Eve and Julian grow closer together and T. C. ends his relationship with Liz to reconcile with his ex-wife. Julian makes a deal with Rebecca that he would give <b>her</b> <b>anything</b> she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison; the judge declares a mistrial. The plot then focuses on Eve's love triangle with T. C. and Julian as she is torn between taking care of T. C. after his stroke and accepting Julian's proposal of marriage. Eve discovers Julian's affair with Valerie Davis, an employee of Crane Industries, leading to her decision to nurse T. C. back to health and renew their relationship to reunite their family. Julian later explains to Eve that he was paying Valerie to search for their son; Eve forgives Valerie, and she and Julian continue their search. In 2007, Eve and Julian discover that Vincent Clarkson (a blackmailer who raped and murdered several people) is their son, and try to support him despite his criminal past. However, Eve cannot accept her son's criminality and incestuous, adulterous affair with Chad Harris-Crane (Vincent's uncle, adoptive cousin and brother-in-law) and begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Her career and reputation suffer, {{and she has a}} breakdown after Vincent's apparent death on August 30, 2007. In the show's final NBC episode on September 7, 2007, Vincent is revealed as intersex; he separates his identity into Vincent and Valerie, an indication of dissociative identity disorder.|$|E

His anger is quickly dispelled by Barbarina, who publicly recalls that he had once offered to give <b>her</b> <b>anything</b> she wants, and asks for Cherubino's hand in marriage. Thoroughly embarrassed, the Count allows Cherubino to stay.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 1891 a {{judicial}} separation {{from her husband}} was pending. She was earning about 2,000 francs a year from la Journée de la petit menagere and from teaching. Her husband, who lived in Algeria, had been ordered to pay her alimony of 200 francs a month, but had not sent <b>her</b> <b>anything.</b> She had two children aged eight and ten who, in accordance with a court order, were living with the family of her lawyer at Sèvres.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth {{returned}} from Nueva Germania in Paraguay following {{the suicide of}} her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in Weimar, where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including Rudolf Steiner (who in 1895 had written {{one of the first}} books praising Nietzsche), to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point {{went so far as to}} employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach <b>her</b> <b>anything</b> about philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Messiaen wrote a {{large body}} of music for the piano. Although a {{considerable}} pianist himself, he was undoubtedly assisted by Yvonne Loriod's formidable piano technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations; in his piano writing from Visions de l'Amen onwards he had her in mind. Messiaen said, [...] "I am able to allow myself the greatest eccentricities because to <b>her</b> <b>anything</b> is possible." ...|$|E
500|$|He then {{published}} the comic novels: John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1963), I, Billy Shakespeare (1965), and Twinkle, Twinkle, [...] "Killer" [...] Kane (1966). He achieved critical success with these books – Marvin Levin in the New York Times, for example, wrote: [...] "Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty, a gifted virtuoso who writes like [...] Perelman"; but significant sales were lacking. It {{was at this}} point that Blatty began a collaboration with director Blake Edwards, writing scripts for comedy films such as: A Shot in the Dark (1964), What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? (1966), Gunn (1967), and Darling Lili (1970), a musical starring Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson. Blatty also worked on his own using the name [...] "Bill Blatty" [...] writing comedy screenplays such as those for the Danny Kaye film The Man from the Diners' Club (1963), and the Warren Beatty/Leslie Caron film Promise <b>Her</b> <b>Anything</b> (1965). Other screenplays include the film adaptation of John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1965), and The Great Bank Robbery (1969).|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all I really need to hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling <b>her</b> <b>anything</b> besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E

2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods. But she understood the methods and standards of scholarship, which is usually {{not the case with}} nuts," [...] nor did she [...] "desire to convert anyone." [...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!"

Hawaiian State Senator Sam Slom, {{who worked with}} her at the Bank of Hawaii, said [...] "I never heard Madelyn say anything disparaging about people of African ancestry or Asian ancestry or anybody's ancestry". Her brother, Charlie Payne, told the Associated Press that his sister's reaction to being made a campaign issue was [...] "no more than just sort of raised eyebrows".|$|R
