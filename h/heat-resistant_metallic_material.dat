40|$|Nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to exhibit outstanding performance which leads to their usage in challenging applications such as coatings and biomedical implant devices. To optimize the performance of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> according to the desired applications, {{it is important to have}} a decent understanding of the structure, processing and properties of these materials. Various efforts have been made to correlate microstructure and properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> Based on these research activities, it is noticed that microstructure and defects (e. g., dislocations and grain boundaries) play a key role in the behavior of these materials. Therefore, it is of great importance to establish methods to quantitatively study microstructures, defects and their interactions in nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> Since the mechanisms controlling the properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> occur at a very small length scale, it is fairly difficult to study them. Unfortunately, most of the characterization techniques used to explore these materials do not have the high enough spatial resolution required for the characterization of these materials. For instance, by applying complex profile-fitting algorithms to X-ray diffraction patterns, it is possible to get an estimation of the average grain size and the average dislocation density within a relatively large area. However, these average values are not enough for developing meticulous phenomenological models which are able to correlate microstructure and properties of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> As another example, electron backscatter diffraction technique also cannot be used widely in the characterization of these materials due to problems such as relative poor spatial resolution (which is ~ 90 nm) and the degradation of Kikuchi diffraction patterns in severely deformed nano-size grain <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> In this study, ASTAR/precession electron diffraction is introduced as a relatively new orientation microscopy technique to characterize defects (e. g., geometrically necessary dislocations and grain boundaries) in challenging nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> The capability of this characterization technique to quantitatively determine the dislocation density distributions of geometrically necessary dislocations in severely deformed <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> is assessed. Based on the developed method, it is possible to determine the distributions and accumulations of dislocations with respect to the nearest grain boundaries and triple junctions. Also, the competency of this technique to study the grain boundary character distributions of nanocrystalline <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> is presented...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{polymers}} exhibit rate-dependent deformation behavior such as nonlinear {{strain rate}} sensitivity and stress relaxation like <b>metallic</b> <b>materials.</b> Despite the different microstructures of polymeric and <b>metallic</b> <b>materials,</b> they have common properties {{with respect to}} inelastic deformation. Unlike most <b>metallic</b> <b>materials,</b> solid polymers and shape memory alloys (SMAs) exhibit highly nonlinear stress-strain behavior upon unloading. The present work employs the viscoplasticity theory [K. Ho, 2011, Trans. Mater.

40|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>materials</b> {{processing}} in an imposed strong static {{magnetic field}} (SSMF) has attracted widely attention {{in the last decade}} since a magnetic field of 10 T or higher becomes easily attainable. Fundamentals including magnetic energy, magnetic anisotropy and magnetic forces influence significantly the research and development of this technology by means of both scientific and engineering paths. The ability to control <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> processing depends crucially on the understanding of the fundamentals and subsequently the engineering of the strong magnetic field effects. This review provides a critical examination of different SSMF effects together with the fundamentals {{that can be used in}} liquid/solid metal controlling and the subsequent <b>metallic</b> <b>materials</b> preparation. These effects are discussed by integrating them into different technologies or experimental results and accompanied by theoretical considerations of the fundamentals. Comprehensive comparisons are then carried out for each series of SSMF effects.
