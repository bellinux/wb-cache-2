40|$|The thesis Kefírer: the {{marketing}} phenomenon aims to analyse this unusual Czech brand {{that is based}} on Adolf Hitler parody. The brand gained attention due to black humour communication connected to Hitler and became very popular. Nevetheless, it was just a short- time effect. Firstly, the thesis presents the brand creation and the brand development and compares this case to similar trends. The next part describes marketing, marketing communications and brand building related to <b>Kefírer.</b> The next chapter analyses the specifics of marketing texts especially from the point of stylistics. The following part states the fundings of the research conducted by the author. Revealed facts allow to clarify brand attitude and efficiency of marketing communications. The last chapter aims to evaluate the unique case of <b>Kefírer</b> and give a recommendation for the other brands...|$|R

Their manual works include {{managing}} vegetable plantations and household works, as well producing hosts, jams, syrups, cakes, <b>kefirs,</b> and religious cards, which enable them to feed themselves from the selling results.|$|R
40|$|Background: The exopolysaccharides (EPS) {{produced}} by yeast exhibit physico-chemical and rheological properties, which {{are useful in}} the production of food and in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as well. The effect was investigated of selected carbon sources on the biosynthesis of EPS by Candida famata and Candida guilliermondii strains originally isolated from <b>kefirs.</b> Results: The biomass yields were dependent on carbon source (sucrose, maltose, lactose, glycerol, sorbitol) and ranged from 4. 13 to 7. 15  g/L. The highest biomass yield was reported for C. guilliermondii after cultivation on maltose. The maximum specific productivity of EPS during cultivation on maltose was 0. 505 and 0. 321 for C. guilliermondii and C. famata, respectively. The highest EPS yield was found for C. guilliermondii strain. The EPS produced under these conditions contained 65. 4 % and 61. 5 % carbohydrates, respectively. The specific growth rate (μ) of C. famata in medium containing EPS as a sole carbon source was 0. 0068  h- 1 and 0. 0138  h- 1 for C. guilliermondii strain. Conclusions: The most preferred carbon source in the synthesis of EPS for both Candida strains was maltose, wherein C. guilliermondii strain showed the higher yield of EPS biosynthesis. The carbon source affected the chemical composition of the resulting EPS and the contribution of carbohydrate in the precipitated preparation of polymers was higher during supplementation of maltose as compared to sucrose. It was also found that the EPS can be a source of carbon for the producing strains...|$|R
25|$|For {{sour milk}} based okroshka, well shaken up natural sour milk(often with the {{addition}} of seed oil) is used {{with the addition}} of pure water and ground garlic. Sometimes manufactured <b>kefir</b> is used instead of natural sour milk for time saving reasons, though some say it detracts from the original taste of okroshka.|$|E
25|$|Šaltibarščiai - cold borscht is {{a summer}} soup based on beets and milk <b>kefir</b> or sour milk, colored a {{shocking}} pink. It {{is made with}} cooked or pickled shredded beets and various other chopped vegetables, such as cucumber, dill, or green onions. Hot boiled potatoes, cold sour cream, and diced hard-boiled eggs are often served alongside to add color, texture, and thermal contrast.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics (live yogurt, <b>kefir,</b> etc.) are {{reputed to}} reduce {{flatulence}} when used to restore balance {{to the normal}} intestinal flora. Live (bioactive) yogurt contains, among other lactic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, which {{may be useful in}} reducing flatulence. L. acidophilus may make the intestinal environment more acidic, supporting a natural balance of the fermentative processes. L. acidophilus is available in supplements. Prebiotics, which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharide, generally increase flatulence in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{alcoholic}} beverages include honey mead, widespread since the 13th century, beer, wine and vodka (old Polish names include okowita and gorzałka). The world's first written mention of vodka originates from Poland. The most popular alcoholic drinks at present are {{beer and wine}} which took over from vodka more popular in the years 1980–98. Tea remains common in Polish society since the 19th century, whilst coffee is drunk widely since the 18th century. Other frequently consumed beverages include various mineral waters and juices, soft drinks popularized by the fast-food chains since the late 20th century, as well as buttermilk, soured milk and <b>kefir.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of <b>kefir</b> yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the most}} {{widespread}} non-alcoholic beverage among the peasantry was kvass, adopted later by Polish nobility also, mainly due to its supposed healing qualities. In contemporary times, tea {{is perhaps the most}} popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and sweetened with sugar. Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russian invaders in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Coffee is also widely drunk in Poland since the 18th century. Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, <b>kefir,</b> soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters and juices. Following the fall of communism in 1989, numerous brands of soft drink have also become popular.|$|E
25|$|In many cultures, {{especially}} in the West, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other mammals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a food product. Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in Europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk {{to be used as}} a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. People process milk into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, <b>kefir,</b> ice cream, and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products.|$|E
500|$|In the summertime, cold borscht is {{a popular}} {{alternative}} to the aforementioned variants, which are normally served hot. It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream, buttermilk, soured milk, <b>kefir</b> or yogurt. The mixture has a distinctive pink or magenta color. It is served refrigerated, typically over finely chopped beetroot, cucumbers, radishes and green onion, together with halves of a hard-boiled egg and sprinkled with fresh dill. Chopped veal, ham, or crawfish tails may be added as well.|$|E
500|$|A {{derivative}} of the Serbian verb , meaning [...] "to fold; sway, swing, rock", the pastry was mentioned in Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić's Serbian dictionary in 1818. It is traditionally served for breakfast with <b>kefir</b> or plain yogurt. Other {{than in the}} Balkans, Gibanica can be found worldwide in restaurants serving Serbian cuisine. It {{is one of the}} most popular and recognizable pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack.

2500|$|The first commercially sold dairy-based {{probiotic}} was Yakult, a {{fermented milk}} with added Lactobacillus casei Shirota, in 1935. Since then many more probiotic foods have {{come on the}} market, mostly [...] dairy products. Non-dairy and unfermented probiotics have been produced, including breakfast cereals and snack bars, in addition to traditional fermented products such as <b>kefir,</b> yogurt, kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut.|$|E
2500|$|When {{raw milk}} is left {{standing}} for a while, it turns [...] "sour". This {{is the result}} of fermentation, where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp., etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency. Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, <b>kefir,</b> and kumis. See Dairy product for more information.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kefir</b> or kephir ( [...] ), {{alternatively}} milk <b>kefir,</b> or búlgaros, is a {{fermented milk}} drink that {{originated in the}} north Caucasus Mountains made with <b>kefir</b> [...] "grains", a yeast/bacterial fermentation starter. It is prepared by inoculating cow, goat, or sheep milk with <b>kefir</b> grains. Traditional <b>kefir</b> was made in goatskin bags that were hung near a doorway; the bag would be knocked by anyone passing through {{to help keep the}} milk and <b>kefir</b> grains well mixed.|$|E
50|$|As it {{contains}} lactobacillus bacteria, <b>kefir</b> {{can be used}} to make a sourdough bread.

50|$|<b>Kefir</b> Cheese is {{made using}} a yeast and {{bacterial}} culture called <b>kefir,</b> {{rather than an}} additional acid or rennet, to separate milk into curd and whey. The curd is separated by cold straining or by heating using the acidic by-products of the <b>kefir</b> culture to set the curd, followed by straining. The resulting cheese has a very tangy, rich flavor and a creamy, dense texture, similar to brie. It {{may or may not}} have live culture remaining in the cheese after manufacture depending on the specific process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kefir</b> can be {{made using}} {{freeze-dried}} cultures commonly available in powder form from health food shops.
