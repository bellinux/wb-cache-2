40|$|Wild Wet Tropics tandan Tandanus tropicanus were {{collected}} from the Bloomfield River, Queensland, for <b>examination</b> <b>by</b> <b>histopathology</b> and bacteriology. This provided an opportunity to establish baseline information on the general health and parasite fauna of native freshwater catfish in a pristine river. Histology of gill tissue revealed epitheliocystis in one fish. This is the first report of epitheliocystis in T. tropicanus. Bacterial culture showed light growth of bacteria from the kidney of only two fish, and these were identified as Aeromonas veronii, A. jandaei and Bacillus/Lactobacillus spp. An unidentified monogenean infection was observed in the gills of four fish, and trematode metacercariae were observed in the extra-ocular tissue of four fish. Nematodes were observed in the tissues of nine fish, and sequence and preliminary phylogenetic analysis of PCR products using an ITS primer suggest that these parasites may be a previously unreported Contracaecum species...|$|E
40|$|Genital warts can be {{diagnosed}} through physical <b>examination</b> and confirmed <b>by</b> <b>histopathology.</b> Noninvasive methods {{are useful for}} ruling out other diagnoses with no harm to the patient. In this study the clinical findings were compared to dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), and to histopathology findings, {{in order to determine}} possible patterns that can aid diagnosis of the lesion. It was possible to identify structural changes on reflectance confocal microscopy that are already known by dermoscopy, in addition to cellular changes previously seen only <b>by</b> histopathological <b>examination.</b> This study shows the use of reflectance confocal microscopy in cases of genital warts, providing important information {{that can be used in}} further studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the ability of PET/CT to restage urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) whether up or down after initial staging <b>by</b> <b>histopathology</b> and other imaging modalities. Patients and methodsDuring three year duration 27 patients with urinary bladder TCC were prospectively evaluated. They were previously diagnosed <b>by</b> <b>histopathology</b> after biopsy and had prior imaging for initial staging. All patients underwent PET/CT examinations following a preset protocol. The images obtained were reconstructed using dedicated software and workstations. Results of PET/CT <b>examinations</b> were confirmed <b>by</b> <b>histopathology.</b> ResultsPrior imaging and PET/CT findings were matched in 17 patients (63 %) with no changes regarding their initial TNM stages and differed in 10 patients (37 %). Six patients (22. 2 %) showed new sites of distant metastasis and unchanged initial stages. Two patients (7. 4 %) were up staged and 2 patients (7. 4 %) were down staged for whom the plan of clinical management was justified. Conclusion 18 F-FDG PET/CT can up and down stage TCC and can detect new sites of nodal or distant metastasis leading to optimal therapy planning...|$|R
40|$|Ewing’s sarcoma is a {{malignant}} non-osteogenic primary tumor of the bone. It {{is one of}} the most common primary malignant tumors of bone. Peak incidence is noticed in second decade of life with male preponderance of 1. 6 : 1. It occurs most frequently in long bones and flat bones of pelvic girdles. In 30 % cases, Ewing’s sarcoma is multicentric in origin. In 14 - 50 %, multiple metastases are present at the time of diagnosis. CNS spread is rare and isolated CNS involvement is not seen. Skull metastasis of Ewing’s sarcoma is not rare compared to primary Ewing’s sarcoma of the skull, but the actual frequency is unknown.

Correlation of {{fluorescent}} antibody, histopathology, {{and culture}} on tissues from 372 animals examined for histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 748 – 751. 1965. —In a survey in the midwestern United States, tissues from 372 animals including 16 species were examined for Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis. All of the specimens were cultured and studied {{by use of}} the fluorescent-antibody (FA) technique, and histopathological studies of tissue sections were done. Among the 372 animals, 300 were negative by all three methods of examination, 34 had blastomycosis, and 21 had histoplasmosis. The remaining 17 were positive for histoplasmosis with the FA technique but were negative <b>by</b> <b>histopathology</b> and culture. An animal was considered to have histoplasmosis or blastomycosis only when the specific fungus was isolated or demonstrated in tissue sections or exudates from cutaneous lesions. Of the 34 blastomycosis cases, 25 (74 %) were positive by FA, 32 (94 %) <b>by</b> <b>histopathology,</b> and 11 (32 %) by culture. Of the 21 histoplasmosis cases, 15 (71 %) were positive by FA, 16 (76 %) <b>by</b> <b>histopathology,</b> and 14 (67 %) by culture. It appeared that FA, histopathology, or culture alone was insufficient for a diagnosis. All three techniques should be employed for the most satisfactory diagnostic results...|$|R
