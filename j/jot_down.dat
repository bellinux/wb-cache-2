5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{this long}} ordeal Heywood {{somehow managed to}} hang on to his prayer book, and used it to <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> details of dates, places and events during his captivity. He {{recorded}} that at Coupang he and his fellow-prisoners were placed in the stocks and confined in the fortress before being sent to Batavia (now Jakarta) on the first leg of the voyage back to England. During a seven-week stay in Batavia confined aboard a Dutch East India Company ship, most of the prisoners, including Heywood, were allowed on deck only twice. On 25 December 1791 they were taken aboard a Dutch ship, Vreedenberg, for passage to Europe via Cape Town. Still in the charge of Captain Edwards, the prisoners were kept in irons for most of the way. At the Cape they were eventually transferred to a British warship, , which set sail for England on 5 April 1792. On 19 June the ship arrived in Portsmouth where the prisoners were moved to the guardship [...]|$|E

2500|$|There {{was clearly}} a {{dichotomy}} in Martí's feeling {{about the kind of}} work he was translating. Like many professionals, he undertook for money translation tasks which had little intellectual or emotional appeal for him. Although Martí never presented a systematic theory of translation nor did he write extensively about his approach to translation, he did <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> occasional thoughts on the subject, showcasing his awareness of the translator's dilemma of the faithful versus the beautiful and stating that [...] "translation should be natural, so that it appears that the book were written in the language to which it has been translated".|$|E
2500|$|Larry's shop partner, Paul Cox, (who {{first met}} Larry at Sixth Street Specials in the East Village, and {{started working with}} him at Psycho Cycles around 1992) {{explained}} how Larry conceived {{the idea for a}} new chopper build: [...] "Working alongside him you realized how much he ran on instinct. [...] Built-in instinct. [...] He would rarely make a sketch or <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> notes...he just envisioned what he wanted in one wide-eyed flash and would turn to you with a look like he saw God. [...] At that point it was 'all over but the cryin,' he would say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Isaiah Sellers {{was not of}} {{literary}} turn or capacity, but he used to <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them [...] "MARK TWAIN", and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable;... At {{the time that the}} telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands– a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.|$|E

2500|$|The poem {{according}} to Coleridge's account, is {{a fragment of}} what it should have been, amounting {{to what he was}} able to <b>jot</b> <b>down</b> from memory: 54 lines. Originally, his dream included between 200 and 300 lines, but he was only able to compose the first 30 before he was interrupted. The second stanza is not necessarily part of the original dream and refers to the dream in the past tense. The rhythm of the poem, like its themes and images, is different from other poems Coleridge wrote during the time, and it is organised in a structure similar to 18th-century odes. The poem relies on many sound-based techniques, including cognate variation and chiasmus. In particular, the poem emphasises the use of the [...] "æ" [...] sound and similar modifications to the standard [...] "a" [...] sound to make the poem sound Asian. Its rhyme scheme found in the first seven lines is repeated in the first seven lines of the second stanza. There is a heavy use of assonance, the reuse of vowel sounds, and a reliance on alliteration, repetition of the first sound of a word, within the poem including the first line: [...] "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan". The stressed sounds, [...] "Xan", [...] "du", [...] "Ku", [...] "Khan", contain assonance in their use of the sounds a-u-u-a, have two rhyming syllables with [...] "Xan" [...] and [...] "Khan", and employ alliteration with the name [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and the reuse of [...] "d" [...] sounds in [...] "Xanadu" [...] and [...] "did". To pull the line together, the [...] "i" [...] sound of [...] "In" [...] is repeated in [...] "did". Later lines do not contain the same amount of symmetry but do rely on assonance and rhymes throughout. The only word that has no true connection to another word is [...] "dome" [...] except in its use of a [...] "d" [...] sound. Though the lines are interconnected, the rhyme scheme and line lengths are irregular.|$|E
