25|$|Satisfactory kiln <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> {{usually be}} {{accomplished}} by regulating the temperature and humidity of the circulating air to control the moisture content of the lumber at any given time. This condition is achieved by applying kiln-drying schedules. The desired objective of an appropriate schedule is to ensure drying lumber at the fastest possible rate without causing objectionable degrade. The following factors have a considerable bearing on the schedules.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{control of}} drying defects in a drying process consists in maintaining {{a balance between}} the rate of evaporation of moisture from the surface and the rate of outward movement of moisture from the interior of the wood. The way in which <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> be controlled will now be explained. One of the most successful ways of wood drying or seasoning would be kiln drying, where the wood is placed into a kiln compartment in stacks and dried by steaming, and releasing the steam slowly.|$|E
25|$|Preservation is {{a problem}} for fairyflies (and other small chalcid wasps). Their tiny sizes require special methods. Specimens have to be dried, if {{collected}} wet, e.g. if ethyl alcohol is used as the killing agent. <b>Drying</b> <b>can</b> make specimens extremely brittle, so additional care should also be taken not to disintegrate them. Mounting specimens (preferably in permanent slides) is also time-consuming and requires a fair amount of practice. They are gummed or glued onto cards, as they can not be mounted on pins like larger insects.|$|E
50|$|Under pressure, {{water is}} {{forced out of}} peat, which is soft and easily compressed, and once <b>dry</b> <b>can</b> be used as fuel. In many countries, {{including}} Ireland and Scotland, peat has traditionally been used for cooking and domestic heating, and stacks of <b>drying</b> peat <b>can</b> still be seen in some rural areas. It remains harvested on an industrial scale for this purpose {{in countries such as}} Ireland and Finland. Its insulating properties make it also of use to industry.|$|R
50|$|If {{the foam}} forms from the {{breakdown}} of a harmful algal bloom (including those caused by some dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria), {{direct contact with the}} foam, or inhalation of aerosols derived from the foam as it <b>dries,</b> <b>can</b> cause skin irritations or respiratory discomfort.|$|R

25|$|In {{order for}} the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> cause secondary dormancy.|$|E
25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and <b>drying,</b> <b>can</b> increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is that mollusca {{from the}} Indian Seas {{which is known}} to {{commerce}} by the French name bouche de mer (a nice morsel from the sea). If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it gasteropeda pulmonifera. It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it commands a great price, {{perhaps as much as}} their much-talked-of edible birds' nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an absorbing and an excretory, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by <b>drying,</b> <b>can</b> be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. Hence the name of gasteropeda pulmonifera.|$|E

25|$|Manure can be {{mechanically}} {{separated into}} a {{solid and liquid}} portion for easier management. Liquids (4-8% <b>dry</b> matter) <b>can</b> be used easily in pump systems for convenient spread over crops and the solid fraction (15-30% <b>dry</b> matter) <b>can</b> be used as stall bedding, spread on crops, composted or exported.|$|R
50|$|Collocational {{restriction}} is {{a linguistic}} term used in morphology. The term {{refers to the}} fact that in certain two-word phrases the meaning of an individual word is restricted to that particular phrase (cf. idiom). For instance: the adjective <b>dry</b> <b>can</b> only mean 'not sweet' in combination with the noun wine.|$|R
50|$|Other {{products}} where drum <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> be used are, for example, starches, breakfast cereals, baby food, instant {{mashed potatoes}} {{to make them}} cold-water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drying</b> <b>can</b> also be {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} in situ desiccants such as molecular sieves, or the use of azeotropic distillation techniques e.g. with a Dean-Stark apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Pretreatment {{of sweet}} potato {{can help to}} {{minimize}} risk of losses. Curing can toughen the skin and heal minor physical damages while <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> reduce spoilage and inactivate metabolic degradation.|$|E
50|$|When the suffix {{is added}} to a word ending in y, the y changes to an i before the suffix, as in happily (from happy). This does not always apply {{in the case of}} monosyllabic words; for example, shy becomes shyly (but <b>dry</b> <b>can</b> become dryly or drily, and gay becomes gaily).|$|R
50|$|Solar {{air heat}} {{can also be}} used in process {{applications}} such as drying laundry, crops (i.e. tea, corn, coffee) and other drying applications. Air heated through a solar collector and then passed over a medium to be <b>dried</b> <b>can</b> provide an efficient means by which to reduce the moisture content of the material.|$|R

50|$|The fine powders {{generated}} by the first stage <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> be recycled in continuous flow either {{at the top of}} the chamber (around the sprayed liquid) or at the bottom, inside the integrated fluidized bed.The drying of the powder can be finalized on an external vibrating fluidized bed.|$|E
5000|$|The waste {{left from}} the {{slaughter}} of mechanically processed calves includes bones that are ground for industrial use, and pieces of meat boiled at high temperature in large silos. After the meat is cooked it is pressed to remove moisture and formed into bales. This process, similar to lyophilization (freeze <b>drying),</b> <b>can</b> preserve the frittoli for years.|$|E
50|$|Boiling and sun <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> oxidize {{and convert}} the various chromium(III) {{compounds}} used in tanning into carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, or chromium(VI). This hexavalent chromium runoff and scraps are then consumed by animals, {{in the case}} of Bangladesh, chickens (the nation's most common source of protein). Up to 25% of the chickens in Bangladesh contained harmful levels of hexavalent chromium, adding to the national health problem load.|$|E
2500|$|In some countries, such as China, Japan, and Korea, {{jellyfish}} {{are known}} as a delicacy. [...] "Dried jellyfish" [...] has become increasingly popular throughout the world. The jellyfish is dried to prevent spoiling; if not <b>dried</b> they <b>can</b> spoil {{within a matter of}} hours. Once <b>dried,</b> they <b>can</b> be stored for weeks at a time.|$|R
50|$|Even when {{hair has}} a defined curl pattern, combing or {{brushing}} it when it is <b>dry</b> <b>can</b> break up the clumps, causing the hair to expand into a frizzy mass. This is often done intentionally to add volume. Blow-drying hair from the ends toward the roots can raise the hair's cuticle, resulting in frizz.|$|R

5000|$|Daing (also {{known as}} Bulad or Tuyô) refers to sun-dried {{fish in the}} Philippines. Almost any kind of fish is used, but the most popular variant uses {{rabbitfish}} (locally known as danggit). Cuttlefish and squid may also dried this way The amount of <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> vary. In the labtingaw variant, the drying period only lasts a few hours, allowing the fish to retain some moisture and texture. In the lamayo variant, the fish isn't dried at all, but simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and spices.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} select {{suitable}} equipment and media {{it should be}} known also which amount and which throughput has to be handled. Small amounts can hardly be cleaned economically in larger plants. Also the type of charging has to be ascertained. Sensitive parts sometimes need to be fixed in boxes. Very economically when dealing with large amounts is bulk charging, but it is quite difficult to achieve a sufficient level of cleanliness with flat pieces clinging together. Also <b>drying</b> <b>can</b> be difficult in these cases.|$|E

30|$|Humidity control: for {{hygroscopic}} materials, air {{relative humidity}} of a <b>drying</b> agent <b>can</b> be a controlling factor. In this case, dehumidification of the <b>drying</b> agent <b>can</b> be considered. However, {{for the majority}} of application, air relative humidity at the entrance of spray drier is below the level that can inhibit completion of the drying process (Masters 1991).|$|R
50|$|Fasciation {{caused by}} damage to genetic {{material}} and by bacteria {{can be controlled}} by not using fasciated plants and disposing of fasciated plants. Avoiding injury to plant bases and keeping them <b>dry</b> <b>can</b> reduce the spread of bacteria. Avoidance of grafting fasciated plants and the pruning of fasciated matter can also reduce the spread of bacteria.|$|R

50|$|Conditioning the CO2 {{with only}} heat causes tissue drying.

Conditioning the CO2 with humidity, in combination with heat, {{has been shown to}} decrease peritoneal damage by reducing the capacity of CO2 to carry moisture away from the tissue. Temperature loss during surgery, due to tissue <b>drying,</b> <b>can</b> be prevented by adequately humidifying and heating the CO2.|$|E
