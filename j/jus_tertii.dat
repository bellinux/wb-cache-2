5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and <b>jus</b> <b>tertii.</b> Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. <b>Jus</b> <b>tertii</b> is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or <b>jus</b> <b>tertii.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On [...] December 29, 2009, [...] the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District {{ruled that}} California Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 cannot {{be read as}} {{imposing}} a federal-style standing doctrine on California's code pleading system of civil procedure. [...] In California, the fundamental inquiry is always whether the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action, [...] not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive {{merits of the claim}} advanced. The court acknowledged that the word [...] "standing" [...] is often sloppily used to refer to what is really <b>jus</b> <b>tertii,</b> and held that <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> in state law {{is not the same thing}} as the federal standing doctrine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jus</b> <b>tertii</b> (Latin, “third party rights”) is {{the legal}} {{classification}} for an argument made by a third party (as opposed to the legal title holder) which attempts to justify entitlement to possessory rights based on the showing of legal title in another person. By showing legitimate title in another person, <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> arguments imply that the present possessor’s interest is illegitimate or that the present possessor is a thief.|$|E

50|$|Under United States law, <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> {{arguments}} are generally insufficient to support actions for replevin because {{they fail to}} show that possession is more legitimate in the third party than in the present possessor.

In support for the action, Art presents evidence that Cathy {{is in fact the}} true owner of the bicycle in question, not Burt.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{defenses}} to trespass to land; license, justification by law, necessity and <b>jus</b> <b>tertii.</b> License is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. These licenses are irrevocable unless there is a flaw in the agreement or it is given by a contract. Once revoked, a license-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the England and Wales' Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest, or the California state constitution, which permits protests on grocery stores and strip malls, despite their presenting a general nuisance to store owners and patrons. <b>Jus</b> <b>tertii</b> is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the plaintiff, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. This defense is unavailable if the plaintiff is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the plaintiff his lease (e.g. an illegal apartment rental, an unauthorized sublet, etc.). Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defense of necessity was accepted. Necessity does not, however, permit a defendant to enter another's property when alternative, though less attractive, courses of action exist.|$|E
5000|$|In Gissel v. State, 727 P.2d 1153 (Idaho 1986), Gissel unlawfully {{harvested}} {{wild rice}} growing on land jointly {{owned by the}} state of Idaho and the National Forest Service. An Idaho Court convicted Gissel of trespass, and Idaho officials seized and sold the rice at auction. Because Idaho had only one half interest in the land, Gissel challenged the state’s authority to seize, sell, and keep the profits from all of the rice. The Idaho Supreme Court held that Gissel was entitled to half of the profits because Idaho did not effectively make the <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> argument on behalf of the federal government, “the Gissels, though trespassers and without legal title, which title rests with the Forest Service, still by mere possession have greater rights superior to that of the state.” ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> {{principle}} also {{extends to}} criminal law. For example, in Anic, Stylianou and Suleyman (1993) 61 SASR 223, three men {{were charged with}} larceny (among other things) after breaking into a house to steal drugs. The men argued {{that they should not}} be charged with stealing something which is unlawfully possessed. The court rejected this argument on the basis that larceny has always been an offence against possession. The common law has never recognised an absolute right of ownership. The owner is merely the person who has the best right to possession. Therefore, a person can be guilty of larceny by stealing from someone who had stolen the thing from someone else. The right to possess drugs is limited by statute but the occupant of the house had a better right to possession than the defendants.|$|E
40|$|When can a {{litigant}} assert someone else’s {{rights in}} federal court? The courts currently purport {{to adhere to}} a “prudential” justiciability rule barring such “thirdparty standing. ” But the Supreme Court has devised exceptions—jus tertii standing and First Amendment overbreadth—under which courts can ignore that rule. The Court has never explained the source of that remarkable judicial power to choose what rights litigants can assert. The doctrine of third-party standing is, in short, an undertheorized muddle. Thankfully, the Court suggested in its 2014 decision in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., that it might soon try to bring order to its third-party standing jurisprudence. Drawing on Lexmark, this Article offers a fresh and timely account of thirdparty standing doctrine. It argues that the rule barring assertion of third-party rights {{has nothing to do}} with prudence and justiciability. Rather, it is best understood as going to the merits of the parties’ dispute, in that it concerns the substantive issue of whether a litigant can establish the grounds of a claim or defense. As a merits doctrine, the rule barring assertion of third-party rights appropriately requires courts to defer to limits placed on substantive rights by the lawmakers who created them. That conclusion raises serious questions concerning the viability of the <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> standing and overbreadth exceptions. This Article argues that <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> standing doctrine can survive, but only if cabined to situations in which recognition of an implied right belonging to the litigant is necessary to effectuate the design of the lawmakers who created the asserted third-party right. The overbreadth doctrine, however, has no place in a world in which courts must defer to lawmakers concerning the scope of substantive rights. But the long-dormant doctrine of <b>jus</b> <b>tertii</b> inseverability, which is grounded in lawmakers’ intentions, could fill some of the void left by the overbreadth doctrine’s demise...|$|E
40|$|A {{bank draft}} or {{certified}} cheque (2 ̆ 2 banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrument 2 ̆ 2) is a negotiable instrument {{on which a}} bank is obligated, used by a paying party in payment to a creditor. The issue explored {{in this article is}} the autonomy of the banker 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrument, namely whether the payee-creditor may enforce it irrespective of the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party, {{as well as of the}} paying party 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the payee-creditor. From a doctrinal point of view, the questions are whether the payee-creditor can be a holder in due course (so as not to be subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party), and whether <b>jus</b> <b>tertii,</b> that is, a defence based on rights ofa thirdparty (here the payingparty), is available to the obligated bankagainsta holdernot in due course. This article answers thefirst question in the affirmative butprovides only apartly affirmative answer to the second. The conclusion is thus that as a holder in due course the-payee-creditor takes the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrumentfreefrom the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepayingparty. At the same time, as a holder notin due course, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepaying party; regardless ofwhether thepayingpartyjoins the action ofthe payee-creditor against the obligated bank, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject also to thepaying party 2 ̆ 7 s claimfor the specific restitution of the instrument. Contract defences of the paying party against the payeecreditor, other than the retroactive cancellation oftheir contract leading to such a claimfor the restitution ofthe instrument, are not available to theobligated bank against the payee-creditor. Autonomy is thus not entirely achieved...|$|E
