5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E
25|$|More intuitively, we can {{say that}} if we want to get all the f(x) values to stay <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> {{neighborhood}} around f(x0), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the x values around x0. If we can do that no matter how small the f(x) neighborhood is, then f is continuous atnbsp&x0.|$|E

25|$|For Class A basketball, {{similar to}} the six-man {{football}} setup the UIL divides schools into separate Division I (large) and Division II (small) districts prior {{to the beginning of}} the season, and separate playoffs are held for each division with the top two teams from each district eligible. This arrangement exists because, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> schools, basketball is the only team sport in which the school participates.|$|E
25|$|The British {{had earlier}} started a {{development}} office that helped <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> {{developments in the}} emirates. The sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. They formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed Adi Bitar, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum's legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council. This council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{drawn from}} ground-sourced systems is {{in most cases}} stored solar heat, and {{it should not be}} {{confused}} with direct geothermal heating, though the latter will contribute <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> measure to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but no heat pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection.|$|E

25|$|Skeletal muscle burns 90mg (0.5 mmol) of glucose each minute during {{continuous}} activity (such as when repetitively {{extending the}} human knee), generating ≈24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22–26% efficient, ≈76 W of heat energy. Resting skeletal muscle has a {{basal metabolic rate}} (resting energy consumption) of 0.63 W/kg making a 160 fold difference between the energy consumption of inactive and active muscles. For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as bonobos, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> lizards.|$|E
25|$|The British {{set up a}} {{development}} office that helped <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed Adi Bitar, Dubai's Sheikh Rashid's legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed. The tribal nature of society {{and the lack of}} definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The Trucial Oman Scouts was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation in {{the basin}} is {{dominated}} by a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), white fir (Abies concolor), and red fir (A. magnifica). The basin also contains significant areas of wet meadows and riparian areas, dry meadows, brush fields (with Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus) and rock outcrop areas, especially at higher elevations. Ceanothus is capable of fixing nitrogen, but mountain alder (Alnus tenuifolia), which grows along many of the basin’s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> streams. The beaches of Lake Tahoe are the only known habitat for the rare Lake Tahoe yellowcress (Rorippa subumbellata), a plant which grows in the wet sand between low- and high-water marks.|$|E

25|$|Internal {{drainage}} {{boards in}} England have responsibilities associated with 398 Sites of Special Scientific Interest plus other designated environmental areas, in co-ordination with Natural England. Slow flowing drainage channels {{such as those}} managed by IDBs can form an important habitat for a diverse community of aquatic and emergent plants, invertebrates and higher organisms. IDB channels form {{one of the last}} refuges in the UK of the BAP registered spined loach (Cobitis Taenia), a small nocturnal bottom feeding fish that have been recorded only in the lower parts of the Trent and Great Ouse catchments, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> rivers and drains in Lincolnshire and East Anglia. All IDBs are currently engaging with their own individual biodiversity action plans which will further enhance their environmental role.|$|E
25|$|Tax exempt {{events to}} raise money for long serving players are also used in some other sports such as football, {{although}} they tend to be called testimonials in that case and are usually a single match rather than a season of events. The tax free status of benefits and testimonials rests on a single early 20th century legal ruling, and great care has to be taken by every benefit committee not to breach the rules <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> way which might lead to the player receiving a demand for tax on the entire amount, or to provoke the Inland Revenue into challenging the exemption on an overall basis. However, testimonials for prominent professional footballers have in modern times increasingly become charity fundraisers in which the player donates either a large part or all of the proceeds to one or more organisations.|$|E
25|$|The E-3 was {{replaced}} by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Britain), which was different <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> details, most notably by using the modified 20mm MG-FF/M wing cannon and having improved head armour for the pilot. With the MG FF/M, it was possible to fire a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell'), which was made using drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M designation.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} general {{question}} of the [...] "hard problem" [...] of consciousness, roughly speaking, {{the question of how}} mental experience arises from a physical basis, a more specialized question is how to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.|$|E

500|$|Though {{typically}} slow on land, crocodilians {{can produce}} brief bursts of speed, and some can run at [...] for short distances. A fast entry into {{water from a}} muddy bank can be effected by plunging to the ground, twisting the body {{from side to side}} and splaying out the limbs. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>small</b> species such as the freshwater crocodile, a running gait can progress to a bounding gallop. This involves the hind limbs launching the body forward and the fore limbs subsequently taking the weight. Next, the hind limbs swing forward as the spine flexes dorso-ventrally, and this sequence of movements is repeated. During terrestrial locomotion, a crocodilian can keep its back and tail straight, since the scales are attached to the vertebrae by muscles. Whether on land or in water, crocodilians can jump or leap by pressing their tails and hind limbs against the substrate and then launching themselves into the air.|$|E
