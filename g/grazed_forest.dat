40|$|Traditionally European {{farmland}} {{management has}} declined {{during the last}} century, mainlydue to abandonment or intensification. When traditional management is replaced by newmethods many species are negatively affected and often threatened with extinction. In thisthesis, the Stockholm archipelago {{is used as a}} platform to study the effects of land use changeover time. The overall aim is to examine how time and space affects plant biodiversity in arural landscape, with focus on heterogeneous pastures. Historical records and maps were interpreted together with aerial photos and used to constructfour time-layers of land use: reflecting the landscape 200 years ago, 100 years ago, 50 yearsago and present. Investigations of plant species richness was conducted in seven habitats; 1) grazed fields, 2) <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edges, 3) <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> interior, 4) former grazed fields, 5) former <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edges, 6) former <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> interior, and 7) historical pasture islands,on 35 islands in Hjälmö-Lådna archipelago on the east-coast of Sweden. Plant speciesrichness was measured for all plant species and for grassland specialist species at three scales:i) fine-scale diversity (α div), ii) large-scale diversity (γ div), and iii) spatial turnover (β div). Using Structural Equation Models (SEM) the variation in species diversity and plantcommunity composition was investigated in relation to landscape context, space andmanagement history. The land use change in the Hjälmö-Lådna archipelago followed the general trends on themainland in Sweden and the rest of Europe with loss of traditional managed habitats, such asmeadows or wooded pastures. However, no intensification and large-scale agriculture hasdeveloped on the islands, mainly because of physical limitations, but also because ofeconomical and conservation reasons. Surprisingly, the grazing pressure on the remaininggrazed habitats had not changed notable over the last century; although the study area was notparticularly species rich (highest average was 15 species/ m 2 in grazed fields). Adjacenthabitats; field and wood pasture, showed a higher similarity in community composition thanexpected compared to random pairs. Grazing and proportion of openness had a positiveinfluence on species richness and especially on grassland specialists. The variation of totaldiversity at the landscape scale was best explained by the heterogeneity of <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> edgesand the local species diversity in fields. The results from the study suggest that grazing is important also in species-poor landscapes,and that it can aid in protecting and promote species-richness also in other types of speciespoorlandscapes. To prevent further loss of biodiversity it is necessary to keep fields andforest edges open with continuous management. To maintain values of high biodiversity andculture in the archipelago it is therefore important that farmers are subsidised by EU tocontinue to grazie heterogeneous habitats and pastures with many trees...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBarbary macaques live {{in extreme}} {{temperate}} environments characterized by strongly seasonal resource availability. They are mainly terrestrial while foraging, harvesting {{food from the}} herbaceous layer. These monkeys are threatened mainly because of anthropogenic habitat degradation. We studied the adaptive capacities of wild groups of Barbary macaques that lived in different cedar forests undergoing varying extents of grazing pressure from domestic livestock. In all three sites, diet varied seasonally. Heavy grazing led to {{a significant decrease in}} herbaceous production and species richness. As a consequence, the monkeys' diet in this poor habitat showed a decreased plant species richness. Moreover, it incorporated fewer above‐ground herbaceous resources, and a greater proportion of subterranean resources (especially hypogeous fungi and subterranean invertebrates such as earthworms, eggs and adults of earwigs, and ant's larvae) than the diet of monkeys inhabiting ungrazed forest. Cedar bark, cedar strobiles, earthworms, and earwigs were part of the monkeys' diet only in <b>grazed</b> <b>forest.</b> Monkeys in heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> compensated for a lack of herbaceous foods by eating subterranean foods preferentially to tree and shrub products. The foods they consumed take longer to harvest and process than the seeds or leaves consumed by Barbary macaques in less heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> habitats. Our results suggest that monkeys do differ in their diets according to the degree of habitat change induced by human activities. They also highlight the dietary flexibility of Barbary macaques as a key element that allows them to cope with degraded habitats.

40|$|Forest {{planting}} {{is increasingly}} being incorporated into land management policies to mitigate diffuse pollution and localised flooding because forest soils {{are associated with}} enhanced hydraulic properties and lower surface runoff compared to soils under other vegetation types. Despite this, {{our understanding of the}} effects of different tree species and forest land use on soil hydraulic properties is limited. In this study we tested for the effects of two tree species, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), subject to contrasting land use systems, namely ungrazed forest and livestock <b>grazed</b> <b>forest,</b> on soil surface saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) at a long term (23 year) experimental site in Scotland. Additionally these forest land use systems were compared to grazed pasture. Kfs was found to be significantly higher under ungrazed Scots pine forest (1239 mm hr− 1) than under ungrazed sycamore forest (379 mm hr− 1) and under both of these forest types than under pasture (32 mm hr− 1). However, this measure did not differ significantly between the sycamore and Scots pine <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> and pasture. It was inferred, from comparison of measured Kfs values with estimated maximum rainfall intensities for various return periods at the site, that surface runoff, as infiltration excess overland flow, would be generated in pasture and <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> by storms with a return period of at least 1 in 2 years, but that surface runoff is extremely rare in the ungrazed forests, regardless of tree species. We concluded that, although tree species with differing characteristics can create large differences in soil hydraulic properties, the influence of land use can mask the influence of trees. The choice of tree species may therefore be less important than forest land use for mitigating the effects of surface runoff...|$|E

Sites were located across three levels of livestock grazing intensity and three levels of selective logging intensity within the most extensive habitat type, Corymbia citriodora-dominant forest. We recorded {{a high rate of}} incidence and large numbers of the hyper-aggressive noisy miner Manorina melanocephala (Passeriformes: Meliphagidae) at the majority of our survey sites, a phenomenon rarely reported in non-cleared landscapes. As shown by numerous studies in fragmented landscapes, the distribution of this species in our study had a substantial negative effect upon the distribution of small passerine species. Noisy miners exerted the strongest influence upon small passerine abundance, and masked any forest management effects. However, key habitat features important for small passerines were identified, including a relatively high density of large trees and stems in the midstorey. Selective logging appeared to exert a minimal effect upon noisy miner abundance, whereas grazing intensity had a profound, positive influence. Noisy miners were most abundant in intensively <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> with minimal midstorey and a low volume of coarse woody debris. Higher road density in the forest landscape also corresponded with increased numbers of noisy miners. Reduction in grazing pressure in Brigalow Belt forests has the potential to benefit small passerine assemblages across large areas through moderating noisy miner abundance. The strong relationship between noisy miners and small passerines suggests that noisy miner abundance could act as an easily measured indicator of forest condition, potentially contributing to monitoring of forest management outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|PosterPig {{traditional}} {{production systems}} in Galicia (NW Spain) {{are based on}} seasonal resources us like chestnut and pastures. The Breeders' Association of the autochthonous Celtic breed of pigs (ASOPORCEL) has developed a novel system within the traditional Galicia <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> areas {{in order to preserve}} landscape quality and biologic diversity, minimizing therefore the environmental impact of pig production. One of the main concerns of silvopastoral system implementation is the need of fencing. Fencing costs could be reduced if animals are rearing with infrastructures based on Pavlov animal condition reflex management in an extensive system. Therefore, cost reduction is obtained thanks to the clear reduction of personnel needs to feed animals, fencing costs and understorey clearance to reduce forest fires. In 2013 an experiment was carried out in Nebra (NW of Spain) in a young Pinus pinaster plantation. Pig stocking rate was around 3. 85 pigs per ha (25 males and 25 females) in a total surface of 13 ha. Forest grazing program was initiated when animals were three months old in March 2013 and finished in December 2013. They were allowed access the whole plot. Concentrate was provided twice every day after sounding an alarm to attract pigs. All the animals adapted rapidly to the system. Two types o understory vegetation (Ulex and Pteridium) was sampled following a transect from close to far away feeding areas (three distances). Fern control was intense, being gorse less consumed. After nine months, average animal daily gain (ADG) obtained was 290 ± 4 gr. We can conclude that the used method is perfectly adaptable to the systems of exploitation suggested for the Celtic pig breed. This will be highly relevant to preserve this autochthonous breed and increase the number of extensive farms in the area while contributing to fix population dedicated to use silvopastoral systems...|$|E

40|$|Weather is {{a general}} {{stochastic}} influence on the life history of weeds. In contrast, anthropogenic disturbance (e. g. land use) is an important deterministic influence on weed demography. Our aim with {{this study was to}} investigate the relative contributions of land use and weather on the demography of Lantana camara (lantana), a weed of agricultural and natural habitats, based on the intensive monitoring of lantana populations under three land uses (viz. farm[pasture], and burnt and grazed forests) in subtropical Australia. Lantana populations were growing vigorously across all land uses (asymptotic population growth rate, lambda > 3). Examination of historical demography using retrospective perturbation analyses showed that weather was a strong influence on lantana demography with the transition from an El Nino (2008 - 09) to a La Nina (2009 - 10) year having a strong positive effect on population growth rate. This effect was most marked at the grazed site, and to a lesser extent at the burnt site, with seedling-to-juvenile and juvenile-to-adult transitions contributing most to these effects. This is likely the result of burning and grazing having eliminated/reduced interspecific competition at these sites. Prospective perturbation analyses revealed that lambda was most sensitive to proportionate changes in growth transitions, followed by fecundity and survival transitions. Examination of context-specific patterns in elasticity revealed that growth and fecundity transitions are likely to be the more critical vital rates to reduce lambda in wet years at the burnt and <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> sites, compared to the farm/pasture site. Management of lantana may need to limit the transition of juveniles into the adult stages, especially in sites where lantana is free from competition (e. g. in the presence of fire or grazing), and this particularly needs to be achieved in wet years. Collectively, these results shed light on aspects of spatial and temporal variation in the demography of lantana, and offer insights on its context-specific management...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} how local scale {{variation in}} human impacts influenced forest structure and tree species richness within Mt Elgon National Park, Uganda. We assessed basal area (BA), stem density, diameter at breast height (dbh) and indicators {{of human activity}} in 343 plots in four study sites, on transects running inwards from the boundary of the park. Mt Elgon hosts the only remaining natural forest in a densely populated region (150 – 1000 p/km 2). All study sites suffered past encroachment for agriculture and were {{in various stages of}} recovery or renewed-clearing {{at the time of the}} study. Areas recovering from encroachment had lower mean BA (BA = 3 – 11 m 2 /ha), dbh and often also lower stem densities than forest that had never been cleared (BA = 21 – 43 m 2 /ha), even 35 years after abandonment and with restoration planting. Human impacts were found beyond 2 km into the park. Although most activities decreased with distance inside the boundary, their prevalence varied among sites. High coefficients of variation in BA (Cv = 0. 8 – 1. 1) and stem density (Cv = 1. 0 – 2. 2) within sites, together with the evidence of sustained human activities, suggest that forest use histories strongly influenced local forest structure. Mean BA increased with distance inside the boundary in all sites, but stem densities reflected more complex patterns. Large trees (dbh ⩾ 20 cm) were most affected by former clearing for agriculture. The collection of stems used as crop-supports reduced regeneration and the density of smaller stems at one site. In another site, charcoal making was associated with the smallest mean BA and marked variability in forest structure. <b>Grazed</b> <b>forest</b> consisted of large trees with very little regeneration. On forest margins in two sites grazing, generally together with fire and tree-cutting, had eroded the forest edge and prevented regeneration. Human impacts as well as natural gradients had major impacts on species richness patterns. Several areas in intermediate states of disturbance showed higher tree species richness than either old-growth forest or more severely degraded areas. This study illustrates the fine scale variation due to local impacts within one forest...|$|E

En fisuras de roca desnuda por erosión del suelo se observó la comunidad de Trachypogon montufari y Senecio pinnatus. La regeneración de Araucaria en el bosque intacto, más los ejemplares viejos sobrevivientes igual que sus plántulas y árbolitos en el Heterothalametum indican el bosque de Araucaria como la actual vegetación natural potencial del planalto de Santa Catarina y el Podocarpo-Araucarietum como la del área de estudios.

Picking up the discussion {{on whether the}} campos replaced the Araucaria forest or the latter originated from the campos, a fitosociological study on an Araucaria forest and on three communities of the campos is presented with special reference to the processes of forest destruction and regeneration. The forest is described as Podocarpo lambertii-Araucarietum angustifoliae. Its canopy consists of Araucaria only; many myrtaceae form, together with the tree fern Dicksonia sellowiana, a rather dense understory of lower trees and shrubs. Numerous species of epiphytes are also common {{in the rain forest}} of southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and NE-Argentina (Misiones); on the other hand, the Podocarpo-Araucarietum is rather poor in climbers. Of the grassland of the «campos», the Plantagini-Andropogonetum macrothrici is described as a meadow with a mean species number of 42, thereof 15 graminiforms and 12 composites nearly all of them geophytes, some herbs with their leaves in rosettes, – possibly a consequence of a long time of cattle grazing and burning. The area of many species ranges from southern Brazil to the NE, N, and Center of Argentina.

40|$|Recent {{global climate}} change is {{influencing}} the behaviour and ecology of species worldwide. Birds are typical systems to study in this context, as they are often migratory and thus subjected {{to a variety of}} environmental effects. This thesis employs the use of long-term ringing records, field observations, historical maps and historical volunteer observations with the aim of describing behavioural and ecological responses of birds to the current environmental change. An investigation into the spring arrival, reproduction and autumn departure in willow warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus) breeding at a southern study site in Sweden (65 °N 18 °E) showed that all three phenological events had advanced in parallel. Thus birds arrive earlier, start breeding earlier and leave Sweden earlier, with the breeding period staying the same in length. By teasing apart the migratory responses of different individuals, it became clear that particularly early arriving males and early departing juveniles had advanced migration. However, willow warblers migrating past a northern study site in Sweden (65 °N 23 °E) displayed no change in autumn departure. When migration in the two regionally separate populations were analyzed in relation to climatic variables, the results indicated that foremost a combined effect of growing season onset and the North Atlantic Oscillation influenced migratory timing, and only in individuals that had advanced migration. As growing season onset had advanced at both regions, but only elicited migratory change in southern willow warblers, it is proposed that intra-specific difference between populations prepare them differently to climate change. Willow warblers breeding at northern latitudes were also displaying absence of an otherwise common behaviour of the species: philopatry. It is suggested that the climate induced change in onset of the growing season, coupled with an increase in available territories, could have enabled a southern influx of dispersal-prone birds adopting a less philopatric breeding behaviour. Availability of territories was also studied in southern Sweden, in relation to 100 years of land use change and future climate change effects on forestry. The mass-conversion of <b>grazed</b> <b>forest</b> into coniferous sylvicultures that has occurred in Sweden 1900 - 2013 was shown to have negatively affected territory availability for willow warblers. The second most common bird species in Sweden, the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), was however shown to be largely unaffected. In a future scenario where rising temperatures will increase growth rates of trees, harvest rotation will be faster and both sylvicultures and logged areas will increase in coverage, favouring both species. Thus commonness in terms of landscape and species occurrence has altered historically and is dynamically linked. Historic perspectives were also applied to observations of spring arrival of 14 migratory bird species. A relative comparison of two data sets, collected over 140 years, revealed that short-distance migrants have changed their spring arrival more than long-distance migrants in southern Sweden. In conclusion, the results of this thesis provide insights into climate change effects on avian behaviour and ecology, document unique observations and contribute with a great spectrum of knowledge, from exact details on responses by individual birds, through long-term changes in populations to historical perspectives on shifts in entire landscapes At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript.
