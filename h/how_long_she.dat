5|$|Jason starts {{work with}} an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and {{children}} in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could be a key witness, he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are too afraid to give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|Testing of Genie's {{language}} occurred {{until the}} end of 1977, but in mid-1975, when she was 18 years old, authorities placed her in a foster care setting which subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, causing her to become afraid to speak and to rapidly begin losing her newly acquired language skills. After removal from this location in April 1977 she moved through several more placements, some of which were highly abusive, causing further regression of her language skills. In early January 1978 Genie's mother suddenly decided to prevent any further testing and scientific observations of Genie, and the very little available information on her ability to communicate since that time is exclusively from personal observations or secondary accounts of them. Nonetheless, linguists have continued analyzing Genie's language long after this time. Since the case study on Genie ended, there has been some controversy and debate among linguists about how much grammar she had acquired and for <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> had been learning new aspects of language.|$|E

[...] Radio Times included Lydia on their list of top bunny boilers due to her attitude towards Sarah and killing her out of jealousy. They ironically joked about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> could repress her murderous impulses, giving her until the new year. (The actual time she tried to kill Zoe). Cara Lee of The Sun branded Lydia stabbing Zoe as one of Hollyoak's most memorable New Year storylines in its history.

500|$|At a basic level, {{the entries}} in Harris's List detail each woman's age, her {{physical}} appearance (including {{the size of}} her breasts), her sexual specialities, and sometimes a description of her genitals. [...] Additional information such as <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. [...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties." [...] More characteristic of Harris's List though, is the 1764 entry for Miss Wilmot, which tells of an amorous encounter with King George III's brother, the Duke of York: ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{its early}} date of composition, Curtain {{makes no mention}} of Poirot's later cases, in novels {{published}} after World War II. Details are only very occasionally anachronistic (such as the mentions of hanging, which had been abolished in Great Britain in 1965). Christie could not know <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> would live nor how popular Poirot would remain. See Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple for further discussion of her views of Poirot. The fifth paragraph in Curtain ("Wounded in the war that for me would always be the war—the war that was wiped out now by a second and more desperate war" [...] says Hastings) marks the passing of time for Hastings, and the long friendship of the two men, as well as making a link to the first Poirot novel.|$|E

2500|$|On November 3, 2004, Elizabeth Edwards {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was treated via chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and continued to work within the Democratic Party and her husband's One America Committee. On March 22, 2007, during his campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination for the presidency, Edwards and his wife announced that her cancer had returned; she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, with newly discovered metastases to the bone and possibly to her lung. They said that the cancer was [...] "no longer curable, but is completely treatable" [...] and that they planned to continue campaigning together with an occasional break when she requires treatment. In June 2010, Elizabeth published a book called Resilience. Her book is about the struggles of her marriage and how she was affected by her husband's affair. In the book, Elizabeth talks about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> was in the dark about the affair and how many times her husband, John, lied about the details of the affair. She never addresses John's mistress by name but calls her a [...] "parasitic groupie" [...] and claims that she is pathetic.

2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career.

[...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E

Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>she</b> saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on.
