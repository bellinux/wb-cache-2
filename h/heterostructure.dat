25|$|The {{problem with}} the simple quantum well diode {{described}} above is that the thin layer is simply too small to effectively confine the light.

25|$|In a {{semiconductor}} <b>heterostructure,</b> {{where a small}} bandgap {{material is}} sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound excitons. This is because the electron and hole which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for optical fiber communications.|$|E

30|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of the critical dimensions of NW <b>heterostructures</b> is helpful for designing advanced nanodevices with high crystal quality and feasible dimensions. Up to date, critical dimensions for axial NW <b>heterostructures</b> have been studied analytically and numerically [11 – 14]. In comparison with axial <b>heterostructures,</b> the strain release mechanism is quite different for core-shell <b>heterostructures.</b> For example, the lateral stress relaxation effect, which can sufficiently reduce the strain in NW axial <b>heterostructures,</b> is negligible in NW core-shell <b>heterostructures</b> due to a large interface area [11]. Instead, the nanosized curve surface of the NW could help to release a part of strain [15]. Although experiments on NW core-shell <b>heterostructures</b> have been widely reported [16 – 21], theoretical work on the critical dimensions of core-shell <b>heterostructures</b> is still limited [22 – 25]. Particularly, the study on critical dimensions for NW core-multishell <b>heterostructures</b> has not been reported yet, although which is significant for achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices. In this paper, we explore the coherency limits in NW core-shell and core-multishell <b>heterostructures</b> by using finite-element method (FEM) based on the energy equilibrium criteria. The effect of the core radius, barrier thickness, and lattice mismatch on the critical QW thickness is discussed and the design criteria for dislocation-free <b>heterostructures</b> are revealed. The theoretical results agree well with previously reported experimental values.|$|R
30|$|Approaches {{involving}} {{thermal evaporation}} and RF sputtering were {{developed for the}} synthesis of <b>heterostructures</b> consisting of a crystalline ZFO-aggregated shell layer and core ZnO nanostructures.

The markedly enhanced acetone gas-sensing response is ascribed to the large surface area of the <b>heterostructures</b> and the formation of heterojunctions between ZnO and ZFO. The ZnO–ZFO <b>heterostructures</b> exhibited high photocurrent response under sunlight illumination during PEC tests. The increased area of the rugged surfaces of the <b>heterostructures</b> and the relatively small bandgap of the ZFO crystallites explain the superior PEC performance of the <b>heterostructures</b> compared with the PEC performance of pure ZnO.|$|R
