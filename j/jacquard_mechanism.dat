5000|$|It is {{recorded}} that in 1855 a Frenchman [...] adapted the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{to a system}} by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in {{the village}} of Cogolin in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur France, La Manufacture Cogolin was {{launched}} by Jean Lauer [...] as a producer of silk. In 1928, the company purchased handlooms, featuring a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> combining needle, cylinder, and punch-card components, and began weaving rugs.|$|E
5000|$|Though this {{eliminated}} {{mistakes in}} the lifting of threads, it still needed an extra operator to control it and the first attempt at automation was made by Jacques Vaucanson in 1745. But {{it was not until}} 1805 that the wildly successful [...] <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> was finally produced.|$|E
5000|$|Jacquard looms {{have often}} been {{credited}} with inspiring {{the development of the}} very first computers.  The English mathematician, engineer, and inventor Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871) {{is believed to have been}} inspired by <b>jacquard</b> loom <b>mechanisms</b> in his development of the first digital programmable computer.|$|R
50|$|A factory {{must choose}} looms and {{shedding}} mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required {{the greater the}} expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a dobby mechanism. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are more likely to}} produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.|$|R
25|$|The Brussels Loom was {{introduced}} into England towards {{the middle of}} the eighteenth century marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the <b>jacquard</b> pattern selecting <b>mechanism</b> and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.|$|R
50|$|In about 1821, the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{began to}} br {{attached}} to looms. By means of punched cards, the Jacquard head allowed patterns of great complexity to be woven. In the twentieth century, Macclesfield Silk Pictures became famous, these were woven on these looms by {{firms such as}} the BWA (Brocklehurst Whiston Amalgamated). Today they are collectables.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} guide bars {{controlled}} by work cams. These allow a shogging movement across 2, 3 or four gaits. The cams {{can not be}} stopped, but threads {{in the middle and}} back bars can be interrupted by a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Each bobbin thread has its own jack- a steel wire that can interrupt its movement and place a hole in the pattern, in effect leaving off a tie.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Japanese fashion for small {{patterned}} designs on textiles during the late Edo (Edo: 1615 - 1868) and Meiji (1868 - 1912) periods. The trend was influenced by Western textiles produced using technologies developed during the European Industrial Revolution, including roller printing and the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism.</b> These Western textiles reached Japan through the port of Nagasaki, open to trade with the Dutch and the Chinese between 1634 and 1868. By {{the end of the}} Edo period, Japanese weavers and dyers had become familiar with them. Albums filled with small fragments of European imported cloth were put together and collected by Japanese textile producers, and even feudal lords, and are evidence of the Japanese fascination with imported Western textiles. The Japanese not only admired the exotic Western patterns, but also the precision and accuracy achieved with the new industrial techniques then being developed. One aspect of Western textiles that especially impressed the Japanese was the extremely small patterns or dots that could be achieved with the new printing processes and the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The small repetitive patterns on European roller prints strongly influenced traditional Japanese stencil resist (katazome) and ikat (kasuri) textiles and new techniques for achieving very small repetitive patterns were developed for both these techniques. Stencil resist textiles with these patterns are known as komon (small pattern). Jacquard-woven silks also reached Japan prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868. The introduction of the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> to Japan in 1873, changed the way the Japanese designed textiles and allowed for even smaller repeat patterns. Graph paper, which arrived with the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism,</b> also facilitated the design of small-patterned woven silks and kasuri...|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of his work as a design {{engineer}} at the Kappel embroidery machine factory, Zahn was familiar with the technology of a shuttle embroidery machine operating according to the system introduced by Isaac Gröbli. During his time in Switzerland, he had got to know the further development work to produce automatic embroidery machines with a <b>jacquard</b> loom <b>mechanism,</b> which were controlled using a punched tape. At that time, the automatic machines were made in line with the patents of J. Arnold Gröbli, a son of Isaak Gröbli, by Kursheedt Manufacturing Co. in the USA for the automated embroidery factory in Rorschach. As Zahn had successfully worked on optimising the Gröbli automatic embroidery machines in Switzerland, an exclusive licensing deal was signed between Feldmühle AG in Rorschach and VOMAG in Plauen in 1900 to manufacture automatic embroidery machines. This marked the start of the Plauen engineering company’s rise to become the world’s largest producer of embroidery machines.|$|R
5000|$|Basile Bouchon {{developed}} {{the control of}} a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. The design was improved by his assistant Jean-Baptiste Falcon and Jacques Vaucanson (1740) [...] Although these improvements controlled the patterns woven, they still required an assistant to operate the mechanism. In 1804 Joseph Marie <b>Jacquard</b> demonstrated a <b>mechanism</b> to automate loom operation. A number of punched cards were linked into a chain of any length. Each card held the instructions for shedding (raising and lowering the warp) and selecting the shuttle for a single pass. It is considered {{an important step in}} the history of computing hardware.|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} principles to perform shedding motion which are; cam mechanism, dobby controlled <b>mechanism</b> and <b>jacquard</b> controlled <b>mechanism.</b> A dobby mechanism {{consists of three}} main parts; drive mechanism, selection mechanism and mechanism for transferring motion to the frames. Rotary dobby mechanisms are being used in shedding process of high-speed weaving machines. In this paper, design and synthesis of a novel drive mechanism had been explained. The drive mechanism, which is used in this research, is an eight component lever-gear mechanism. The most important innovation is in the motion transmission mechanism on the main shaft of rotational dobby. It is known that main shaft in rotary dobby has dwell period in only one direction. The novel drive mechanism is designed to make equally timed, double stand-by positioned oscilational motion. After designing of the rotary dobby, the mechanisms are produced and montaged. It was confirmed that dobby run well and durably with all mechanism and shedding process is precisely carried out. The experimental values of dwell angles at {{the right and left}} dead-center positions are similar to theoretical values. Experimental results show that; if the drive mechanism and dobby is generated with advanced technology, it is possible to use it in dobby industry...|$|R
40|$|Recreating of Ancient Fabrics The {{technique}} {{of how the}} Warp-faced compound weave was once woven {{has been the focus}} of study for many specialists in Japan. It was around 1921 that Heizo Tatsumura began to recreate ancient textiles from the 7 th and 8 th centuries, found in the Shosoin Repository and the Horyuji Temple. He used the new <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which had been imported from France in 1873 with great dexterity. With this mechanism, along with his gifted creativity and inventiveness Tatsumura produced new techniques for the purpose of recreation. The very modem Tatsumura chose the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> as his tool but at the same time he believed in the importance of always going back to original ancient textiles and to thoroughly research them. His strong conviction to learn from the past became especially important in order to understand and recreate the weaving techniques of the highly intricate warp-faced compound weave which was born in ancient China and lost around the Tang Period (A. D. 618 - 906). Tatsumura discovered valuable information through his persistence in investigation and his ability to reconstruct the work on the modem <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> shed light on techniques that had been lost. His thinking process and his deep knowledge of ancient methodology gives us insights into how an ancient weaver might have set up and operated his loom. This paper presents speculations on how the warp-faced compound weave was woven in China earlier than the Han and into the Tang periods by gaining inspirations from the methods invented and recreated by Tatsumura on his <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> to reconstruct the complex weave...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{report an}} {{overview}} {{on the use}} of CAD/CAM in Indian textile industry and their impact specific to silk saree designers. <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> is used to create design on silk sarees by means of shed formation. The jacquard machine has been using chain of punched cards laced together in sequence in silk saree weaving, since its invention in 1801 to till date. The punched cards which carry the design of the saree has been prepared manually and controlled manually till date by Indian silk saree designers. Recently a new system has been emerged in Indian market to completely mechanize the entire process of silk weaving. The design for silk sarees can be generated using a CAD system and later design generated may be directly machined on punched cards by means of CAM and finally the entire cards be joined together in sequence using a lacing machine. These cards are then used to operate Jacquard machine. The effectiveness of this newly implemented CAD/CAM system in production of punched cards and without CAD/CAM is studied...|$|E
40|$|Starting in 1872, Japanese {{artisans}} travelled from Kyoto to Lyon, {{to study}} in the town 2 ̆ 7 s famed silk-weaving studios. The <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> which they helped to introduce to Japan the following year made the sorabiki-bata draw-loom obsolete within decades. Even in its. most basic application as an addition to hand-loom weaving, this new technology fundamentally transformed the geography and the economy of manufacturing processes {{by the turn of}} the century, but these new methods 2 ̆ 7 impact on the actual fabrics which they were used to produce has yet to be fully explored. In both countries at this time, woven pictures were one popular venue for testing the limits old and new technologies. Drafts and samples of actual woven silks in the thesis books of students from Lyon 2 ̆ 7 s weaving studios of the same decades show that some late nineteenth-century Japanese pictorial weaves are quite literal adaptations of Lyon patterning vocabularies. Upon actually mapping out the mathematical relationship of surface structures within most other textiles from this period, however, extremely complicated woven images often prove to be simpler than they first appear, executed on very basic draw-loom principals...|$|E
5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the <b>Jacquard</b> loom. The <b>mechanism</b> behind the <b>Jacquard</b> loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the opportunities of wider characterization of textile materials, fabrics, upholstery fabrics, fibers, yarns or others, which may accumulate electric charge. A non-contact way for electrostatic properties measurement based on affecting those materials by ions with {{positive or negative}} charge is described. The method allows to measure simultaneously the time dependences of the surface voltage and the electric charge during the charging process and the time dependences of the surface voltage during the discharging process. From the measured dependencies the following set of parameters was measured or calculated: the surface voltage limiting value, the surface voltage semi-decay time, the maximum deposited charge, the layer capacitance, {{the energy of the}} accumulated charge and others. The surface voltage distribution measurement method when the investigated textile material is affected by ion flux was also described. To verify the applicability of the proposed methods for characterization of textile materials {{in order to determine the}} above-mentioned parameters of cotton, linen, wool, viscose, acetate, polyester, polyester coated with polytetrafluoroethylene, a series of experiments were performed. The surface voltage distribution measurement method based on affecting textile materials by ions with positive charge was described and a surface voltage distribution of a polyester-cotton upholstery fabric produced by a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> was presented. The performed experiments demonstrate the possibilities of method application for comparison of the electrostatic properties of different textile materials used for the same tasks or the same materials produced by different technological processes.

40|$|With {{regard to}} textile design in general, and Lyonnais {{designers}} in particular, {{there is still}} no global synthesis and very little detailed research available. Yet, some studies were published in Lyon, {{at the end of the}} 19 th and beginning of the 20 th century, by local historians with family, professional and cultural links with the silk manufactures. It is not coincidence that their work occurred at this period: at the end of the 19 th century, the Lyonnais silk industry went through a series of serious economic and structural crises. The change begun at the beginning of the 19 th century with the introduction of the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>mechanism</b> was painfully reaching completion, transforming the Lyonnais silk manufactures (la FabriQue lyonnaise), and provoking an identity crisis in Lyonnais textiles. Historians echoed this crisis in their research which was largely devoted to the 2 ̆ 2 golden age 2 ̆ 2 of the manufactures, which, for them, was the 18 th century. Their texts and, in partIcular, studies devoted to the 18 th century designers, form the basis of my paper which focuses on the influence of these texts on the teaching of silk design at the beginning of the 20 th century. In addition, the collections of the Musee des Tissus de Lyon and the institutional archives, allow development of my discussion along three lines: firstly, the image of silk designers and their education in the 18 th century will be described, analysed and discussed; secondly, the institutions which educated designers at the beginning of the 20 th century, the teaching staff and the curricula will be presented; and thirdly, the main reforms in teaching design at the time will be analysed through the personalities, statutes and philosophy of their authors. In particular, the successive professional status of these authors, and their views on an ideal training derived from that of the 18 th century, will be discussed, as well as the resistance that they met, and the actual impelementation of their ideas...|$|E
