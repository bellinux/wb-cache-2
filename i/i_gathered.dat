He {{was one of the}} group of young Normans whom David <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> around him from Henry I of England's area of influence in northern France; he was therefore likely of a similar age to David. As David's tenant, Ranulf held Great Doddington on the former's Honour of Huntingdon. His ties to Great Doddington are confirmed when, as a settler in Scotland, he later granted the Church of Great Doddington,(Ecclesiam de Dodintona juxta Bertonam) to Jedburgh Abbey.|$|E

Anna Akhmatova was immensely dignified, with unhurried gestures, a noble head, beautiful, somewhat severe features, and an expression of immense sadness.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010 Riis {{published}} {{a book about his}} career as a rider, emphasizing that doping throughout the time he had competed was not considered by the peloton as [...] "cheat", but simply {{as a part of the}} [...] "normal preparation" [...] for a professional rider. He described he had started to dope only with corticosteroids in the 80s, and then as he previously had confessed upgraded his doping with EPO in 1993–98. Riis states the last time he doped as a rider was in July 1998. [...] He states he quit during the 1998 Tour de France when he was nearly caught by the police. As part of the probe into the Festina doping scandal, police were on their way to search the rooms of his Telekom teammates. Riis offered the following comment on the episode: “In my room I didn’t have a choice. My vials of doping products had to disappear quickly. In just a few minutes <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> all my doses of EPO and threw them down the toilet”.|$|E
