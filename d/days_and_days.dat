500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>days,</b> [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>days.</b> Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E
