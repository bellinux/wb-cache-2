5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example.

The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member.

5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
