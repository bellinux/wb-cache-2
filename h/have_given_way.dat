5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to a steel guard rail, and most {{recently}} to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s saw the White Rock/South Surrey area {{develop into}} a {{suburban}} bedroom community of the Lower Mainland. A real-estate boom in the area drew many young families to homes marketed to young professionals, a process that intensified in the mid-1990s. Today, {{many parts of the}} community resemble the type of suburban development seen across North America. Some cliffside cottages <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to large homes, and multimillion-dollar properties have appeared in the area.|$|E

Merit badge workbooks are used by counselors, summer camps, and merit badge colleges. Workbooks have also been developed for ranks, Cub Scout belt loops, and Webelos activity pins.|$|E
25|$|The halt was {{demolished}} by British Rail {{long before}} final {{closure of the}} line in December 1980 and little remains of it today.

The rails remain embedded in the tarmac over Peppin Lane and an old signal stands over the trackbed to the south towards Louth.

25|$|Somalis have old {{visual art}} traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, {{affluent}} urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers {{to work on}} their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the mihrabs and pillars of ancient Somali mosques. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially woodwork, was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as spoons, combs and bowls. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the aqal. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.|$|E
25|$|The Clyde Waterfront Regeneration {{project is}} {{expected}} to attract investment of up to £5.6bn in the area from Glasgow Green to Dumbarton. Market gardens and garden centres have grown up on the fertile plains of the Clyde Valley. Tourism has also brought many back to the riverside, especially in Glasgow where former docklands <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to housing and amenities on the banks in the city, for instance, the Glasgow Harbour project, the Glasgow Science Centre, {{and the creation of}} the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. With the migration of the commercial Port of Glasgow downstream to the deeper waters of the Firth of Clyde, the river has been extensively cleaned up, once having a very poor reputation for pollution and sewage, {{in order to make it}} suitable for recreational use.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, as {{in other}} western Canadian cities, the old {{warehouses}} have long since outlived their utility as the railways <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the trucking on the highways as the preferred mode of commercial transport: in western Canada, as elsewhere, shipping by rail was supplanted by highway trucking once the Trans-Canada highway was extended from Ontario to the West and transport from eastern to western Canada no longer needed to dip into the United States below the Great Lakes. The old warehouses, however, have survived long enough that their destruction is not a foregone conclusion: they are, in Regina {{as in other}} North American cities, being turned into residential condominiums, tony restaurants and shopping precincts. However, at one time the warehouse district (together with the grain elevators adjacent to the CPR line) was Regina’s tenuous commercial raison d’être.|$|E

25|$|In the {{northern}} part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. For instance, Puerto Aisén, at 45°24' south latitude, receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6°C in the summer months and 4.7°C in the winter months. Although the area generally is chilly and wet, the combination of channels, fjords, snowcapped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within such a narrow space makes for breathtaking views. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to others better adapted to a generally colder climate.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, {{to explain}} the {{surprising}} amount of fission-product fallout produced by hydrogen bombs, Ralph Lapp coined the term fission-fusion-fission to describe a process inside {{what he called a}} three-stage thermonuclear weapon. His process explanation was correct, but his choice of terms caused confusion in the open literature. The stages of a nuclear weapon are not fission, fusion, and fission. They are the primary, the secondary, and, in a very few exceptional and powerful weapons no longer in service, the tertiary. Tertiary (three-stage) designs, such as the U.S. B41 nuclear bomb and the Soviet Tsar Bomba (discussed above), were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; all have since been retired, as the typical multi-megaton yields of tertiary bombs do not destroy targets efficiently, since they waste energy in a sphere above and below an area of land. For this reason, all tertiary bombs <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> in modern nuclear arsenals to multiple smaller two-stage bomb tactics (see for example, MIRV). Such two-stage bombs, even though less efficient in yield, are nevertheless more destructive for their total bomb weight, because they can be distributed over a roughly two-dimensional area of land at the target.|$|E
25|$|Non-financial cooperatives - such as {{fishermen}} coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, {{continue to}} provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing {{to have a very}} close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.|$|E

500|$|Each of {{the three}} Black Triptychs {{displays}} sequential views of a single figure, and each seems to be intended {{to be viewed as}} if stills from a film. The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon's usual intellectual sources; they do not depict Golgotha, Handes, or Leopold Bloom. In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer's own life and the artist's life, and presents him as a nameless, slumped, gathering of flesh, awaiting the onset of death. Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993, the art critic Juan Vicente Aliaga wrote that [...] "the horror, the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude. The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to the solitary figure leaning over the washbasin, standing firm on the smooth ground, neutral, bald-headed, his convex back deformed, his testicles contracted in a fold." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this {{in the form of}} his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his {{proposals}} for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's [...] "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells [...] "had minimal capacity for putting [...] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, [...] "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> to Wells some years earlier: [...] "God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{childhood}} accident, Stainer {{had lost the}} use of one eye. There is some confusion about this and he may merely have had a lazy eye, but {{for a brief period}} in 1875 he feared he was losing the sight of the other eye. This proved not to be the case, but he suffered from eye strain and impairment to his vision for much of his life. This was a major reason for his decision to retire from St Paul's Cathedral in 1888, while still in his forties. As Bumpus was to write, [...] "Such honours as are at the disposal of his fellow musicians have been freely showered upon him, for he is universally beloved and esteemed, but his many onerous duties, his organistship of this, his presidency of that, and his incessant hard work as an examiner, have all involved responsibility and constant application, and the result is that his sight and general health <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>way</b> under the severe strain of sheer hard work." ...|$|E
