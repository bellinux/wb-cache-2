5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and <b>inferential</b> <b>statistics</b> is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the correlational effects of motivation, emotional intelligence and human capital development on the job satisfaction of librarians in Nigerian public universities. A correlational survey research design was adopted. The study population consisted of 1, 254 librarians in public university libraries in Nigeria, from which 923 were selected using simple random sampling. The research instrument used was a self-developed questionnaire. A response rate of 67. 2 % was achieved. Data were analysed using descriptive (percentage, mean, average mean and standard deviation) and <b>inferential</b> (MANOVA) <b>statistics.</b> The study revealed significant relationship among the combined contributions of motivation, emotional intelligence and human capital development on job satisfaction and productivity of librarians in public university libraries in Nigeria. It concluded that contrary to general belief, job satisfaction and productivity levels of librarians in university libraries was high. It was recommended that university library management should continue to promote values such as improved job satisfaction of its workforce...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{studying}} the psychological strategies for resolving interpersonal conflict among administrators in Tertiary Institutions with Nnamdi Azikiwe University as the case study.

25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and <b>inferential</b> <b>statistics,</b> which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E

Routine neuropsychological examination conducted > 4 years after the onset of brain damage showed little deficits of minor severity.
