2500|$|Through the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, {{the federal}} {{government}} enforced a closed season on the bison. The plains bison were near extinction in Canada and with these efforts the government hoped to preserve them from the Aboriginal hunters. However, preservation efforts were not only for recreational purposes. After the Second World War, the bison were used for commercial purposes as well. As the numbers of bison increased, {{the federal government}} issued licenses to regulate the number of bison and bring in revenue. Aboriginal people were excluded from national parks, not {{for the sake of}} preserving wilderness, but in the [...] "interests of game conservation, sport <b>hunting,</b> <b>tourism,</b> and Indian assimilation." [...] This represented a shift in federal wildlife policy goals from preservation of wilderness to the commercialization and commodification of the national parks. Aboriginals were excluded from Banff National Park in Alberta to serve the goals of conservationists and sportsmen. Furthermore, Aboriginal hunting practices conflicted with the goals of the Department of Indian Affairs to civilize and assimilate Aboriginal people. Beginning in the 1880s, Aboriginals were encouraged to abandon hunting in favour of an agricultural lifestyle. Thus, the goal of the federal government was not to restore and protect wilderness, but to create an environment with an abundance of wildlife attractions for sports hunting and tourism, and to assimilate Aboriginal people into Euro-Canadian society.|$|E

40|$|Landowners {{and game}} reserve {{managers}} are often {{faced with the}} decision whether to undertake consumptive (such as hunting) and/or non-consumptive (such as tourism) use of wildlife resources on their properties. Here a theoretical model {{was used to examine}} cases where the game reserve management allocated the amount of land devoted to hunting (trophy <b>hunting)</b> and <b>tourism,</b> based on three scenarios: (1) hunting is separated from tourism but wildlife is shared; (2) <b>hunting</b> and <b>tourism</b> co-exist; and (3) <b>hunting</b> and <b>tourism</b> are separated by a fence. The consumptive and non-consumptive uses are not mutually exclusive; careful planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated depends on the magnitude of the consumptive use. When consumptive use is not dominant, the two are compatible in the same shared area, provided the wildlife population is sufficiently large...|$|R
