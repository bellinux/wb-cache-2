500|$|Despite {{strong support}} from the black community, all the {{students}} who had been arrested were convicted of disorderly conduct and fined $50. The students refused to pay the fines, however, and chose instead to serve thirty-three days in the county workhouse. Diane Nash issued a statement {{on behalf of the}} students explaining the decision: [...] "We <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E

5000|$|Writer Tim Minear [...] "pretty much always loathed this script", {{although}} he <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{it had been}} filmed differently, {{it could have been}} stronger.

2500|$|Convinced of the {{effectiveness}} of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their Tour of England in 1976. England Captain Tony Greig's infamous [...] "grovel" [...] comment is shown in its entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Australians could do it, so could they. Viv Richards is shown as dominating the Test series as a batsman, where he scored 829 runs in four tests with two double-centuries. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.|$|E
2500|$|Khan has a {{reputation}} for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Different Test playing {{nations had}} {{different}} point of view about this structural change in the way Test Cricket has been played. Bangladesh was the voice one to voice its concern in opposing this. [...] "We do not support this system," [...] Mahbubul Anam, Vice President, Bangladesh Cricket Board said. [...] "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will get. If we didn't play against better standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have come this far. We were the king of the jungle from where we achieved the Test status. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we go backwards, our cricket will regress." [...] Should this happen, Bangladesh, who are ranked ninth, are likely to slip into Division Two and settle for lesser Tests against top cricketing nations.|$|E

Duggan {{describes}} Ikeda's Oscar as having [...] "much more self-knowledge" [...] than the Oscar of the film, describing Demy's Oscar as being [...] "in denial about sexual and class issues". Duggan <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> agency is taken away from Oscar, it is given to lower-class characters in the film, in particular Andre.|$|R
2500|$|The British, however, were {{extremely}} reluctant to act. British public opinion had rapidly shifted (as it did after World War I) away from anti-German sentiment towards {{a desire for}} reconciliation. There was a strong feeling that putting elderly and sick men on trial {{three years after the}} war was unjust. There was also {{the fact that many of}} the events referred to by the Americans had taken place in the Soviet Union and Poland, which were now, with the onset of the Cold War, political adversaries and no longer co-operating with western war crimes investigations. The British Military Governor in Germany, Air Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas, was strongly opposed. He wrote: [...] "We are apparently prepared to send these men, including one who is 73, to trial by the Americans. I frankly do not like this. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Americans wish to be critical in our inaction in trying war criminals, I should prefer that they should continue to criticise rather than that we should commit an injustice in order to avoid their criticism." ...|$|E
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E

5000|$|Dee Snider {{has stated}} that he likes many of the songs on the album, vocally. However he <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they play any of them live, it may bring back bad {{memories}} for the band. In 2012, the band introduced [...] "Wake Up (The Sleeping Giant)" [...] into their set, following demands from fans for material to be included {{from all of the}} band's studio albums.|$|R

He would {{be in favor of}} federal legislation extending marriage rights to gays, because he <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> this issue is left up to the states, some states will continue to deny gays equal protection and equal rights.|$|R
