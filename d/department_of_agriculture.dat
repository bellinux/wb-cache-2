5|$|In 1976, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for Western Australia's 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations, the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> decided to restore the historic Avondale farm to its original state to display the achievements of Western Australian farmers. In response to the announcement, farmers from around the state responded generously with donations of old machinery and equipment. Most of this machinery was restored by <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> mechanics. In 1978 an invitation to visit and open Avondale's agricultural displays was sent to Prince Charles, this was accepted and on 16 March 1979 Avondale was officially opened with commemorative tree planting near the entrance to the farm.|$|E

5|$|The United States has 154 {{protected}} areas known as National Forests covering 188,336,179 acres (762,169km2/294,275 sq. mi). The National Forests are {{managed by the}} U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture.</b> The first National Forest was established as the Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve on March 30, 1891, then in the Department of the Interior. In 1897, the Organic Act provided purposes for which forest reserves could be established, including to protect the forest, secure water supplies, and supply timber. With the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the President of the United States was given the power to set aside forest reserves in the public domain. With the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves {{became part of the}} U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> in the newly created U.S. Forest Service.|$|E

In addition, the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} homestead block {{faced an}} uncertain future for many years, until {{it was given to}} the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> in 1924. Initially intended for the production of pure seed wheat and oats, very little was produced for several years. Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for dairy cattle, prior to them being sent to group settlers in the state's South West. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> efforts are under way to promote G.brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source {{but it is difficult to}} propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.|$|E

5|$|According to the US <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|Adams and {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} it were initially set aside {{as part of}} the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve under the Department of the Interior in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the Forest Service, was created under the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the Rainier National Forest was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the Columbia National Forest. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, Gifford Pinchot. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.|$|E
5|$|After bee populations dropped 23% in {{the winter}} of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency and <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> formed a task force to address the issue. In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. However, according to Syngenta and the F.A.O., the total number of beehives worldwide continues to grow. An insecticide produced by Syngenta was banned by the European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E
