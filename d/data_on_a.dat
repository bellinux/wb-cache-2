5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E

When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensorimotor applications.|$|E

25|$|DDR3-xxx denotes data {{transfer}} rate, and describes DDR chips, whereas PC3-xxxx denotes theoretical bandwidth (with {{the last two}} digits truncated), and is used to describe assembled DIMMs. Bandwidth is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight.

25|$|Each vdev {{that the}} user defines, is {{completely}} independent from every other vdev, so {{different types of}} vdev can be mixed arbitrarily in a single ZFS system. If data redundancy is required (so that data is protected against physical device failure), then this is ensured by the user when they organize devices into vdevs, either by using a mirrored vdev or a RaidZ vdev. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single device vdev may be lost if the device develops a fault. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mirrored or RaidZ vdev will only be lost if enough disks fail {{at the same time}} (or before the system has resilvered any replacements due to recent disk failures). A ZFS vdev will continue to function in service if it is capable of providing at least one copy of the data stored on it, although it may become slower due to error fixing and resilvering, as part of its self-repair and data integrity processes. However ZFS is designed to not become unreasonably slow due to self-repair (unless directed to do so by an administrator) since one of its goals is to be capable of uninterrupted continual use even during self checking and self repair.|$|E

25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E
