40|$|Contract {{bridge is}} an example of an {{incomplete}} information game for which computers typically do not perform better than expert <b>human</b> <b>bridge</b> players. In particular, the typi-cal bidding decisions of <b>human</b> <b>bridge</b> players are difficult to mimic with a computer program, and thus automatic bridge bidding remains to be a challenging research problem. Cur-rently, the possibility of automatic bidding without mimick-ing human players has not been fully studied. In this work, we take an initiative to study such a possibility for the specific problem of bidding without competition. We propose a novel learning framework to let a computer program learn its own bidding decisions. The framework transforms the bidding problem into a learning problem, and then solves the problem with a carefully designed model that consists of cost-sensitive classifiers and upper-confidence-bound algorithms. We vali-date the proposed model and find that it performs competi-tively to the champion computer bridge program that mimics human bidding decisions. ...|$|E

This work shows an example of the new style to develop complex research, which could suggest a new way of working in Latin-American, granted that there is the will to enhance current scientific level. Una de las características de la investigación científica actual, es el alto grado de complejidad y tecnicismo alcanzado en las últimas décadas, lo cual por una parte ha obligado a la generación de profesionales altamente especializados, pero que por otra ha producido una brecha comunicacional entre los participantes de las distintas ramas de la ciencia. Una de las estrategias con las cuales el mundo científico ha intentado traspasar dicha barrera, ha sido a través de la generación de estrategias de trabajo multidisciplinarias, es decir, conformadas por profesionales provenientes de variadas áreas del conocimiento, los cuales hacen de puente científico y humano entre los distintos equipos de trabajo en donde se desarrollan. Este nuevo estilo de hacer investigación ha posibilitado el surgimiento de nuevas ramas de la ciencia, como por ejemplo la Biotecnología. Dentro de ésta, una de las áreas emergentes, la Ingeniería de Tejidos, se destaca por ser un muy buen ejemplo del potencial que trae el trabajar en equipos multidisciplinarios. La causa de esta necesidad -de trabajo en equipos multidisciplinarios- es ante todo, el evitar errores técnicos que pueden provocar la muerte de un paciente, lo cual puede ser solucionado únicamente al realizar investigación en absoluta concurrencia de profesionales de todos los campos del conocimiento. Sin embargo, y a pesar de los éxitos obtenidos al realizar investigación en equipos multidisciplinarios, dicha estrategia es empleada escasamente en Latinoamérica, debido básicamente a motivos personales y culturales. De este modo, este trabajo intenta mostrar un ejemplo del nuevo enfoque que actualmente se emplea para hacer investigación compleja, sugiriendo a su vez el camino a seguir, si es que realmente se desea potenciar el desarrollo de la ciencia en Latinoamérica.

30|$|These {{potential}} {{interactions of}} cultural and biophysical factors allow us to reconsider further the hypothesis of ignition limitation. In many historic landscapes, human habitation areas and movement corridors were nearly saturated with human ignitions (Lewis 1980, Drobyshev et al. 2004, Granström and Niklasson 2008), with small, low intensity fires predominating in these areas during the marginal burning conditions (Pyne 1995, 2007) that occurred in most years, {{and particularly in the}} early and late fire season (Table 1). During drought years, these fires grew and amalgamated with lightning ignitions that predominated in areas lightly used by <b>humans</b> (<b>Bridge</b> et al. 2005). Ultimately, with ignition relatively common, the amount of burn area was determined by the frequency of weather periods favorable for fire growth, and the temporal pattern of fuel recovery in areas burned in periods immediately past (e.g., a few months to a few years prior to re-ignition). These interacting spatial and temporal processes of ignition limitation require further research (Krawchuk et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Human {{exposure}} to a blast wave itself without any fragment impact can still result in primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). To investigate the mechanical response of human brain to primary blast waves and to identify the injury mechanisms of bTBI, a three-dimensional finite element head model consisting of the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, nasal cavity, and brain was developed from the imaging data set of a human head. The finite element head model was implemented with material models and was partially validated against a published cadaveric experiment. This study included three scenarios of blast-head interaction simulations using the same five TNT doses: the simulations of head exposures to the blast waves coming from three horizontal orientations (anterior, right lateral, posterior), to the blast waves generated from the explosives laid on the ground, and to the blast waves within a small room. For the horizontal blast-head simulations, the influences of the blast levels and exposure orientations on the pressure and shear stress responses of brain were analyzed. For the simulation scenarios of the ground blasts and the room blasts, the influences of the blast levels and the blast wave reflections on the pressure and shear stress responses of brain were assessed. The patterns of intracranial pressure waves and the high-pressure locations were investigated. Based on a published pressure-based injury criterion of cerebral contusion, the locations and injury severities of cerebral contusion for every simulation scenario were predicted. High von-Mises stresses {{were found on the}} cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord in every simulation. However, it was predicted that diffuse axonal injury (DAI) did not occur in any simulation using a DAI criterion based on von-Mises stress.

Sharing the lecturer’s selfunderstanding developed through analytic reflexivity focused on their autoethnographic narrative offers a pedagogical approach {{to contribute to the}} nursing profession’s policy drive to increase the use of reflective practices. The research design required me to develop my own analytic autoethnography. Four themes emerged from the data ‘Being in between’, ‘Perceived vulnerability of self’, ‘Knowing and doing’, and ‘Uniting selves’. A methodological analysis of the processes involved in undertaking my analytic autoethnography raised issues pertaining to the timing and health warnings of exploring memory as data. Actor-Network Theory was used as an evaluative framework to reposition the research findings back into relationships which support educational practices. The conclusion supports the use of analytic autoethnography to enable lecturers to share hidden practices which underpin the use of self within professional identities. Recommendations seek methodological literature which makes explicit possible emotional reactions to the reconstruction of self through analysis of memories. Being able to share narratives offers a pedagogical approach based on the dilemmas and tensions of being <b>human,</b> <b>bridging</b> the humanity between service user, student and lecturer...|$|R
