Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll 4) -Notch {{signaling}} {{is important}} in tumor angiogenesis; however, the prognostic value of D 114 detection in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) remains unclear. The present study aimed {{to determine whether the}} presence of high Dll 4 expres-sion levels was correlated with poor prognosis in CCRCC following curative resection. The D 114 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> in four paired samples of CCRCC tissues and adjacent normal renal tissues were assayed by western blotting. Surgical speci-mens comprised 121 CCRCC tissue samples and 65 normal renal tissue samples, obtained from patients with CCRCC. The specimens were immunohistochemically assessed to deter-mine Dll 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR- 2) <b>expression</b> <b>levels.</b> The prognostic significance of Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. The correlation between Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> and VEGFR- 2 <b>expression</b> <b>levels,</b> tumor stage, tumor grade and metastasis, was examined by χ 2 test and multivariate logistic regression. As determined by the western blotting results, Dll 4 protein <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly increased in CCRCC tissues compared with those in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. From the analysis of the surgical specimens, 53 (43. 8 %) CCRCC patients exhibited immunohistochemically high Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> and 68 (56. 2 %) patients exhibited low Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels.</b> The survival curves revealed that the patients with high Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> had significantly shorter survival times than the patients with low Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> (P< 0. 001). Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that the presence of high Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> was independently associated with reduced overall survival and progression-free survival times (P= 0. 021 and 0. 034, respectively). A positive correlation was also identified between Dll 4 and VEGFR‑ 2 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> (P= 0. 001). In conclusion, the results show that the pres-ence of high Dll 4 <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> was clearly associated with high VEGFR- 2 <b>expression</b> <b>levels,</b> tumor grade, tumor stage and poor prognosis in CCRCC patients. Therefore, inhibition of Dll 4 may exert potent growth inhibitory effects on tumors resistant to anti-VEGF therapies for CCRCC...|$|R

A total of 56 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal control group, model group, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) group, and DL‑propargylglycine (PAG) group. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by CCl 4. The rats in the PAG group were intraperitoneally injected with PAG, an inhibitor of cystathionine-γ‑lyase (CSE). The rats in the NaHS group were intraperitoneally injected with NaHS. An equal volume of saline solution was intraperitoneally injected into both the control and model groups. All rats were sacrificed at week three or four following treatment. The serum levels of hyal-uronidase (HA), laminin protein (LN), procollagen III (PcIII), and collagen IV (cIV) were detected using ELISA. The serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and albumin (ALB) were detected using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The liver mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> of CSE were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative poly-merase chain reaction. The liver <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> of AGTR 1 and the plasma <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> of H 2 S were detected using western blot analyses.

The differences in <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> between these tissues may therefore indicate that metabolic activity is more vigorous in newly generated tissues.|$|R

Different dosage compensation strategies evolved in different lineages, but all involve changes in chromatin. This paper discusses our current {{understanding of how}} modifications of the histone H 4 tail, particularly changes in levels of H 4 lysine 16 acetylation and H 4 lysine 20 methylation, {{can be used in}} different contexts to either modulate gene <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> twofold or to completely inhibit transcription...|$|R
