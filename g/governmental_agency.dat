5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E

The change offers challenges to local <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies</b> {{and other public}} health agencies at all the ministerial, regional, and provincial levels. A public health regulatory and legislative framework for dengue vector control by local <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies</b> is a national topic of interest because dengue control program has been integrated into healthcare services at the provincial level and also has been given priority in health plans of local <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> The enabling environments of local administrations are unique, so this critical review focuses on the authority of local <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies</b> responsible for disease prevention and control and on the functioning of local legislation with respect to dengue vector control and practices...|$|R

The request was approved by Bergsstaten, the <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> responsible for handling geological issues regarding prospecting. The approval has been met with criticism on the municipal and county administrative levels, citing that the many cracks in the limestone bedrock could cause the groundwater to become contaminated by the gas prospecting.|$|E

In 1988 Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada, a <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> that supervises national parks, implemented the Saint Lawrence Action Plan {{with the aim of}} reducing industrial contamination by 90% by 1993; as of 1992, the emissions had been reduced by 59%.

25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of {{centralised}} monopoly on radio and television, the <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalised {{in the next two}} decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.|$|E

All of them are administered by the Judicial Council located in Pristina. The Kosovo Police is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the <b>governmental</b> <b>agency.</b> The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.|$|E

25|$|Up until 1666, when Patriarch Nikon was deposed by the tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church {{had been}} {{independent}} of the State. In 1721 the first Russian Emperor, Peter I abolished completely the patriarchate and so the Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Emperor himself. From 1721 until the Bolsheviks' October Revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church was essentially transformed into a <b>governmental</b> <b>agency,</b> a tool used to various degrees by the tsars in the imperial campaigns of Russification. The Church was allowed by the State to levy taxes on the peasants. Therefore, the Church, along with the imperial regime, to which it belonged, came to be presented as {{an enemy of the}} people by the Bolsheviks and the other Russian revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|Canberra's {{workforce}} did {{not escape}} the adverse effects of the Great Depression when it hit Australia in 1929. In 1930, around 1800 labour-force workers and about one-seventh of the Commonwealth Public Service's staff in Canberra were retrenched. Soon, Canberra's growth ground to a complete halt, with even the <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> supervising its development being abolished for a while. Some major construction projects planned for the capital, including Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, were not undertaken due to funds set aside for their planned construction being diverted for relief measures during the Depression. Having lost this early impetus, neither denomination has built a major centre of worship in the capital, although, in 1973, after major extensions, St Christopher's Catholic Church, Manuka, was raised {{to the status of}} Cathedral (the Anglican cathedral remains in the nearby city of Goulburn).|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under {{the law of the}} Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank, or any other <b>governmental</b> <b>agency.</b> His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{documents}} linking to the Ergenekon conspiracy are {{the basis}} of the case against Barış Terkoğlu, Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and the other detainees in the OdaTV case. Examinations of the documents conducted by computer experts at Boğaziçi University, Yıldız Technical University, Middle East Technical University and the American data processing company DataDevastation have refuted the validity of the documents and concluded that outside sources targeted the journalists’ computers. Rare and malicious computer viruses, including Autorun-BJ and , allowed the placement of the documents to go unnoticed by the defendants. Another judicial report prepared by the <b>governmental</b> <b>agency</b> Tübitak also confirmed the infection by malicious viruses but couldn't neither confirm nor reject any outside intervention. A second report rejected the journalists' claims on the basis that the documents had been created before the computers were infected. Yet another review of the OdaTV evidence by digital forensics company Arsenal Consulting revealed that local attacks, which required physical access, were responsible for delivery of the incriminating documents to Barış Pehlivan’s OdaTV computer.|$|E
