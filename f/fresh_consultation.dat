[...] He stated that the government remains convinced that new nuclear power plants are needed to help combat climate change and over-reliance on imported oil and gas. Attention was drawn in the media to numerous connections to nuclear industry lobbyists within the Labour Party.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes we emerged upon a wider {{thoroughfare}} or came to {{a larger}} building than the generality, well lighted. Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey, and I saw him in consultation with others. Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern. This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters, like so many insects, and a <b>fresh</b> <b>consultation</b> would be held. By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits. Single police-officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket {{what he wanted to}} know and point to him where to go. At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men, which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time. When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive.|$|E

50|$|After {{extended}} {{debate on}} the merits of PGS, including a <b>fresh</b> <b>consultation</b> in July 2007 comparing PGS with alternative tariff-style alternatives, the Government announced in October 2007 that a new Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) was its preferred method of securing generalised contributions from developers. The Government legislated for CIL in the 2008 Planning Act. Implementing Regulations followed, and CIL came into force in England and Wales on 6 April 2010. However, by that stage its future was already in doubt because a Conservative Party Green Paper of February 2010 indicated that were they to come to power they would scrap it in favour of a different mechanism (though many commentators indicated that they could not see much difference). By April 2010 the UK General Election was less than a month away; so few local authorities took steps to implement CIL until the new Government's intentions became clear.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2011 Cable said [...] "rewards for failure" [...] were unforgivable at a {{time when}} real wages were being {{squeezed}} across the country. Speaking yesterday at the Association of British Insurers biennial conference, the Liberal Democrat Cabinet Minister warned he planned to bring [...] "excessive and unjustified" [...] pay under control by launching a <b>fresh</b> <b>consultation</b> into the subject next month. [...] "Britain does have some world-class executives and one of the real privileges of my job is dealing with them," [...] he said. [...] "But let's not forget that, using the FTSE 100 as a benchmark, investors have barely seen a return {{since the turn of the}} century. For most of that time, they would have been better off investing in government bonds. [...] "And yet, in 2010, average total pay for FTSE 100 chief executives was 120 times that of the average UK employee. Back in 1998, the multiple was 45." ...|$|E
