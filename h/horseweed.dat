40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted in 2007 and 2008 to evaluate the foliar efficacy of saflufenacil on <b>horseweed</b> (Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.). In the field, saflufenacil applied alone at the lowest rate (25 g/ha) resulted in less control than all other herbicide treatments that included saflufenacil. The addition of glyphosate to 25 g/ha of saflufenacil increased the level of control over either herbicide applied alone. However, the addition of glyphosate to 50 g/ha of saflufenacil or greater was not beneficial because saflufenacil alone provided at least 95 % control. Overall, <b>horseweed</b> height {{at the time of}} herbicide application had very little effect on the efficacy of saflufenacil applied alone or in combination with glyphosate. 	Application variables can enhance the foliar activity of saflufenacil. In the greenhouse, saflufenacil combined with glyphosate provided greater control than saflufenacil applied alone on both glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant <b>horseweed</b> populations. Regardless of <b>horseweed</b> population or glyphosate, saflufenacil had greater activity when crop oil concentrate rather than nonionic surfactant was used as the adjuvant.

40|$|<b>Horseweed</b> (Conyza canadensis), {{a member}} of the Asteraceae family, is an annual plant that can behave as either a winter annual or summer annual. It {{predominantly}} self-pollinates and can produce in excess of 1, 000, 000 wind-blown seeds. While it is commonly thought to be an early succesionary plant in roadsides, along railroad tracks, and in fallow areas, it has become problematic in no-till soybean production. It is most notorious because of its ability to rapidly evolve resistances to various chemical herbicides. It was the first reported broadleaf weed with resistance to glyphosate in the U. S. and has since been reported in numerous states. ^ <b>Horseweed</b> populations in Indiana have been shown to have evolved resistance to glyphosate and ALS-inhibitors.

Five cover crop treatments included no cover, fall-sown winter wheat, spring-sown oat, pea, and mixture of oat and pea. Cover crops were terminated in May with glyphosate and 2, 4 -D alone or with residual herbicides of flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone. By 10 weeks after termination in 2014 - 2015, Palmer amaranth biomass and density, averaged across cover crops. was 95 and 69 % less with residual herbicides than without, respectively, and Palmer amaranth biomass was 98 % less in winter wheat and 91 % less in spring oat, averaged across termination methods, compared to no cover. Time to 50 % Palmer amaranth emergence was delayed with winter wheat, spring oat, and spring oat/pea mix without residual herbicide.

40|$|Emergence of glyphosate-resistant <b>horseweed</b> (Conyza canadensis) biotypes is {{an example}} of how unrelenting use of a single mode of action {{herbicide}} in agricultural weed control drives genetic adaptation in targeted species. While in other weeds glyphosate resistance arose from target site mutation or target gene amplification, the resistance mechanism in <b>horseweed</b> uses neither of these, being instead linked to reduced herbicide uptake and/or translocation. The molecular components underpinning <b>horseweed</b> glyphosate-resistance remain unknown. Here, we used an in vitro leaf disc system for comparative analysis of proteins extracted from control and glyphosate-treated tissues of glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible biotypes.

Protein gel analysis and mass spectrometry identified mainly chloroplast proteins differentially expressed between the biotypes before and after glyphosate treatment. Chloroplasts are the organelles in which the shikimate pathway, which is targeted by glyphosate, is located. Calvin cycle enzymes and proteins of unknown function were among the proteins identified.

The objectives of this thesis were to assess the risk of common Nebraska weeds developing resistance to dicamba, quantify baseline dose-response to dicamba of high-risk weed species, and survey the variability in dicamba dose-response among populations of those species. Twenty-five weed scientists were asked to estimate the risk likelihood of ten weed species evolving resistance to dicamba following the commercialization of dicamba-resistant soybean. Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis), kochia (Kochia scoparia) and <b>horseweed</b> (Conyza canadensis) were rated the highest risk species. Ten populations of <b>horseweed,</b> 73 populations of kochia, and 41 populations of common waterhemp were collected across Nebraska. Greenhouse dose-response studies using a range of dicamba doses (0 g ae ha- 1 up to 35, 840 g ha- 1, depending on the species) were conducted on 10 <b>horseweed</b> populations, 10 kochia populations, and 4 common waterhemp populations that represented a range of susceptibility to dicamba in preliminary experiments. Visual injury and dry weight data were measured 28 days after treatment (DAT), data was fit to a four-parameter log-logistic equation, and the dicamba doses necessary to achieve 90 % visual injury (I 90) or reduction in dry weight (GR 90) were calculated for each population. There was a three-fold difference in dicamba dose necessary to achieve I 90 between the least and most susceptible <b>horseweed</b> populations, a 18. 4 fold difference among kochia populations, and a 1. 5 fold difference among common waterhemp populations. Similar variation in susceptibility for each species was calculated for GR 90 values. Two or three replications of plants were allowed to grow for 84 - 228 DAT.

In the second experiment, the <b>horseweed</b> biotypes (susceptible and resistant to glyphosate) were evaluated in five periods as following: 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after herbicide application (DAH). The photosynthetic rate, transpiration, carboxylation efficiency, and water efficiency were determined using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), and shikimic acid concentration by HPLC. The application of glyphosate damaged the photosynthetic parameters of the susceptible biotype, causing complete inhibition of the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, carboxylation efficiency and water use efficiency, starting from the 7 DAH. On the other hand, total inhibition of the photosynthetic parameters was not observed for the resistant biotype. Shikimic acid accumulation occurred in both biotypes after glyphosate application but the susceptible biotype had the highest concentrations, indicating greater sensitivity of the enzyme EPSPs.
