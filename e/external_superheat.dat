40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{refrigeration}} performance of three CO 2  trans-critical solutions based on field measurements. The measurements {{are carried out}} in five supermarkets in Sweden. Using the field measurements, low and medium temperature level cooling capacities and COP's are calculated for ten-minute intervals, filtered and averaged to monthly values. The {{results indicate that the}} systems using trans-critical booster system with gas removal from the intermediate vessel have relatively the highest total COP. The reasons are higher evaporation temperatures, lower internal and <b>external</b> <b>superheat</b> and higher total efficiency of booster compressors. Another important factor is gas removal from the intermediate vessel which leads to higher COP of low temperature level. Comparing the older and newer installed systems, a trend in energy efficiency improvement has been seen. The study shows this improvement originates from both changes in the system design (e. g. two stage expansion) and components efficiency improvement (e. g. higher total efficiency of compressors - lower internal superheat and higher evaporation temperatures of cabinets).

40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{nature of}} the flue gases in municipal waste incinerators does not allow the temperature of steam in the boiler to rise above 400 °C. An increase in steam temperature {{can be achieved by}} <b>external</b> <b>superheating</b> in a heat recovery steam generator positioned behind a gas turbine, so that steam of a higher energy content becomes available for electricity production. The paper addresses two basic schemes. In one case, steam generated at a waste-to-energy plant is superheated in a combined-cycle plant that operates in parallel. In the other case, the exhaust from a gas turbine plant is sent through a superheater section to the waste incinerator's boiler providing preheated combustion air. Performance of these configurations together with two modified schemes was analyzed in terms of efficiency, natural gas consumption and boiler surface area. An exergy analysis of the cases was carried out. The results showed that the integrated options can effect a substantial increase in efficiency. The hot windbox configuration was found the most effective solution, offering a smaller boiler surface area along with a moderate rate of natural gas consumption...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis project, {{conventional}} supermarket refrigeration systems using R 404 A {{are compared}} with refrigeration system solutions using natural refrigerants such as {{carbon dioxide and}} ammonia. This systems analysis considers {{the behavior of those}} systems in floating condensing and heat recovery mode. System heating and cooling COP have been calculated by using computer simulation with the calculation software EES (Engineering Equation Solver). The impact of important parameters such as sub-cooling, <b>external</b> <b>superheating</b> and compressor discharge was also determined through the computer models. The estimation of the system annual energy consumptions shows that systems using natural refrigerant can compete with systems using artificial refrigerant by using heat recovery system such as heat pump cascade, heat pump cascade for sub-cooling, fixed pressure system and de-superheater. If the indirect emission of systems using natural refrigerant and artificial refrigerant is approximately similar, the direct emission for carbon dioxide systems and ammonia systems can be estimated to be 10000 times less important than R 404 A systems. Multi-unit refrigeration systems have also been studied in this project; it appears that in theory COP improvement of 10 % is possible if the condensing temperature of each unit is controlled adequatelly. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{situation}} on the energy market in the EU countries, especially in Germany, is in a changing process. An increasing amount of wind and solar power plants is feeding renewable, but fluctuating energy into the grid especially in Germany. Thus balancing power is needed. Combined heat and power plants (CHPs) are mostly operating heat driven at the moment. Fraunhofer UMSICHT is researching a new concept of <b>external</b> <b>superheating</b> for CHP with biomass and waste fuels for increasing electrical efficiency and additional storage option for decoupling heat and power generation in order to supply the electrical grid with power on demand. Therefore the main component for this superheating concept, the so-called Pebble-Heater, has been developed. It is a pebble bed regenerator and storage system for high temperatures, {{which can be used}} in combined heat and power plants (CHPs). Theoretical examination of the Pebble-Heater performance has been accomplished at the test facilities of F raunhofer UMSICHT during the last years. Especially the temperature profile inside the pebble bed has been simulated. The results of the Pebble-Heater test rig with a storage capacity of approximately 80 kW. h at temperatures up to 1200 °C are presented in this paper. The temperature profile inside the pebble bed combined with a low pressure drop have shown the potential to implement the Pebble-Heater for high temperature usage...|$|R
