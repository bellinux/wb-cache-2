5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> few different directions. Matters {{such as the}} sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many {{attempts have been made to}} form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes.

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that {{going to war with}} Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E

Jhulan Goswami holds the Indian record for {{the highest number of}} wickets (50), best average (20.90) and best bowling figures in an innings (five wickets for eleven runs) in the format. Along with Priyanka Roy, Goswami is among the eleven players who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> five-wicket haul in women's Twenty20 Internationals.

5|$|In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship {{reached its}} zenith when he officiated at the {{coronation}} of King Edgar.

This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms {{the basis of the}} present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.|$|E

5|$|In One Day International (ODI) matches, twenty-four bowlers <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> wicket {{with their}} first ball.

Clive Lloyd, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Sadagoppan Ramesh, and Martin van Jaarsveld did not bowl in their debut matches, and took their first wicket on a later appearance. Ramesh and Wavell Hinds took their first wickets during the same match on 6 September 1999; the former in the first innings of the match and the latter in the second. It was also the only wicket taken by Ramesh during his ODI career.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|Recent historians, however, <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign {{is famous for}} {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E
