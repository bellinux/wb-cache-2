25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could not infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E
25|$|Why is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — {{is a game}} while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps {{important to note that}} this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004, they decided {{to take some time}} off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went. We just made the record we wanted to make".|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
500|$|Anna in {{particular}} and the whole film in general had undergone a number {{of changes in the}} story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, [...] "Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so we changed some of the animation to support it." [...] Bell generally described her character as [...] "She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined." [...] Lee added, [...] "She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing." [...] Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, [...] " [...] secret weapon is love," [...] while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is [...] "a character who is willing to stand beside you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong." [...] In the images of Frozens main characters released by Disney in July 2013, Anna and her role in the film was described as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|We {{need not}} {{debate about the}} mere words {{evolution}} or progress: personally I prefer to call it reform.

Evolution is a metaphor from mere automatic unrolling. Progress is a metaphor from merely walking along a road--very likely the wrong road.

500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} American {{democracy}} was also questioned.

The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the position taken by the Karaites {{in regards to the}} authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first {{that the majority of the}} Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally [...] "Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states [...] "this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do it?" [...] indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include: ...|$|E

2500|$|Pride and Prejudice, {{like most}} of Austen's other works, employs the {{narrative}} technique of free indirect speech, which {{has been defined as}} [...] "the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke". Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different. By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. [...] "The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential... for it is through <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions." [...] The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character. Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the [...] "oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.". Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals FID as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, FID is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.|$|E
