50|$|Gendered {{roles in}} {{heterosexual}} marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating {{the repetition of}} actions by one’s role-model or parent of the same biological sex. Imitation {{in the physical world}} that impacts one’s gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one’s life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person’s gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different. One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> Non traditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine. Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.|$|E

[...] Finally, Andy Argyrakis of Today's Christian Music negatively stated, [...] "The group's sugar-coated sounds and watered-down lyrics lack the full-fledged punch needed to fully land on any level....And while the project has a few more glimpses of saccharine satisfaction (thanks in part to producer Ian Eskelin of All Star United fame), Eleventyseven still has plenty of room to develop before a Galactic Conquest is even remotely possible." ...|$|E

HRW checked 63 claims of threats, of which only one (Life in Kosovo) had led to prosecution and finally acquittal.

5000|$|Management issues {{involves}} examining {{perceptions about}} management and perceptions by management. It includes various qualitative judgments regarding {{the competence of}} current and prospective company management, as well as issues related to insider buying, future strategies to increase operations and market share. Most large companies compensate executives {{through a combination of}} cash, restricted stock and options. It is a positive sign when members of management are also shareholders. When management makes large purchases of their own stock with private funds, it may indicate that management insiders feel the company is undervalued, or that a favorable company event will occur soon. Another way {{to get a feel for}} management capability is to examine how executives performed at other companies in the past. Warren Buffett has several recommendations for investors who want to evaluate a company’s management as a precursor to possible investment in that company’s stock. For example, he advises that one way to determine if management <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> is to evaluate the company's return on equity, instead of their earnings per share (the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock). [...] "The primary test of managerial economic performance is achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share." [...] Buffett notes that because companies usually retain a portion of their earnings, the assets a profitable company owns should increase annually. This additional cash allows the company to report increased earnings per share even if their performance is deteriorating. He also emphasizes investing in companies with a management team that is committed to controlling costs. Cost-control is reflected by a profit margin exceeding those of competitors. Superior managers [...] "attack costs as vigorously when profits are at record levels as when they are under pressure". Therefore, be wary of companies that have opulent corporate offices, unusually large corporate staffs and other signs of bloat. Additionally, Buffett suggests investing in companies with honest and candid management, and avoiding companies that have a history of using accounting gimmicks to inflate profits or have misled investors in the past.|$|E
