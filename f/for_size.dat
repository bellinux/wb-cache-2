5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states <b>for</b> <b>size.</b> He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

30|$|Conventional methodologies (empirical, analytical, numerical, hybrid, etc.) {{are used}} <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems, {{especially when the}} required weather data (irradiance, temperature, humidity, clearness index, wind speed, etc.) and the information concerning the location of PV system are available [1, 2, 3, 4]. These methods present a good solution <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> PV systems under the above conditions. However, such techniques cannot be used <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> PV systems where the required data are not available. Moreover, {{the majority of the}} above methods need long-term meteorological data, such as total solar irradiance, air temperature, and wind speed, for their operations. To overcome this situation, newer methods have been developed <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> the parameters <b>for</b> PV systems based on artificial intelligence techniques [5]. However, these methods require complex implementation and powerful calculators to reduce time calculation which makes simple methods, like worst month method, still largely used in sizing simple remote PV systems.|$|R

5|$|The Aylesbury duck is a {{breed of}} domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It {{is a large}} duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a {{horizontal}} stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding <b>for</b> <b>size,</b> shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred <b>for</b> <b>size</b> and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Flanders is {{particularly}} conducive to agriculture, {{and in the}} 19th century the draining of the swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes. As there were no existing horses {{in the area that}} were suitable for plowing, the farmers found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use. From the 1850s on, farmers selected horses that eventually became the Trait du Nord. The farmers combined large Belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with the Ardennes and Dutch breeds <b>for</b> <b>size,</b> weight and strength. The result was a muscular, powerful, and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement. The Trait du Nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming, as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport.|$|E

5|$|The result, as {{confirmed}} by Russell, also contains {{the distribution of}} solution counts for the 44 equivalence classes. The listed values are before application of the 9! factor for labeling and the two 72 factors (722 = 5184) for each of Stack 2,3 and Band2,3 permutations. The number of completions for each class is consistently {{on the order of}} 100,000,000, while the number of Band1 permutations covered by each class however varies from 4 – 3240. Within this wide size range, there are clearly two clusters. Ranked by size, the lower 33 classes average ~400 permutations/class, while the upper 11 average ~2100. The disparity in consistency between the distributions <b>for</b> <b>size</b> and number of completions or the separation into two clusters by size is yet to be examined.|$|E

Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30–37), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25–29) are used for domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42-49).

5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate <b>for</b> <b>size</b> changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
