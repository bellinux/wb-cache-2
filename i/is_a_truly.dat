500|$|The New York Times {{wrote in}} 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, [...] "No amount of {{analysis}} can convey {{the quality of}} The Sun Also Rises. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame." [...] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, [...] "changed the nature of American writing."

Erlewine picked [...] "White Christmas" [...] and [...] "Orange Colored Sky" [...] as his top choices from the EP. Evigshed Magazine's Sylvia Lesas complimented the musical arrangement of the tracks, saying that Gaga's vocals were a highlight of the EP and adding, [...] "'The Edge of Glory' featuring beautiful piano line gives me chills. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> moving version. [...] makes every song special." [...] Erin Strecker from Entertainment Weekly gave a glowing review of the release, explaining that Gaga's fans might have been expecting a release like A Very Gaga Holiday which gave prominence to the singer's vocals. She added that the songs showed [...] "how much her voice really is well-suited for the big-band and jazz-era stylings on these tunes".|$|E

[...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy the heck out of a visit to the Wizarding World".

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> original comic mind.

[...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?'

She said: [...] "EastEnders has been wonderful to me and it's no secret that it changed my life all of those years ago. I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's such a wonderful character to play.

To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever."

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Although harshly {{condemned}} by critics who decried {{its lack of}} conventional finish, Manet's work had admirers from the beginning.

Then, as I said, {{there is such a}} surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality." ...|$|E
