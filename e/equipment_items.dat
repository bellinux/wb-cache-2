5|$|The first {{staff were}} posted {{to the new}} {{contingent}} headquarters at Holsworthy Barracks in September 1988. At the same time, Major J.J. Hutchings was deployed as liaison officer to UN HQ in New York. In October, the CDF formally tasked the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) to raise, train, equip and support the force for Namibia. By December the two units comprising 1ASC had been raised from more than thirty different units of the Australian Army, and were being trained and prepared for deployment. Equipment, vehicles and weapons were procured, transferred from across the army and prepared at Moorebank; this included the painting of all vehicles and major <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> in UN livery and packing items for transport to Namibia. During the buildup it was recognised that the families required support during the deployment, and Network 17 was established to support the mostly Sydney-based soldiers' and officers' families.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. <b>Equipment</b> <b>items,</b> which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|The player's ship is {{protected}} by a shield which decreases when attacked by enemies. If the shield is fully depleted, the player dies and must start the game again from a previous section of the fight without any collected power-ups. Nevertheless, the player can reclaim the missing power-ups from {{the ruins of the}} destroyed ship. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The player can also collect <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> which grant special powers. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the Cloaking Device renders the player invisible to enemies for 30 seconds. During the game, the player may also deploy the Guide-Bot, an assistant that keeps track of the next objective and shows the player the way to a specific target.|$|E

50|$|<b>Equipment</b> {{is special}} <b>items</b> a {{character}} can wield or wear. An <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> usually {{is associated with}} an element, including fire, water, earth, air, light and darkness. A piece of equipment can be armor or a weapon.|$|R
50|$|ILS is a {{technique}} introduced by the US Army {{to ensure that the}} supportability of an <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> is considered during its design and development. The technique was adopted by the UK MOD in 1993 and made compulsory for the procurement of the majority of MOD equipment.|$|R
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

25|$|The U13 Bluebird was {{introduced}} in New Zealand in early 1993, and was produced at Nissan's assembly plant in South Auckland from CKD packs imported from Japan until 1997, when it {{was replaced by the}} Primera. The model came in for lots of praise for its handling roadholding, with some models benefitting from the Attesa's passively steered rear wheels. New Zealand models were; S (base model, not available until later), SE (mid-spec), SES (sport) and SEL (luxury). Several versions of the sedan, including the first local Bluebird to have standard factory-fitted air conditioning (automatic climate control in this case) and optional locally supplied leather upholstery. At launch, some local motoring writers criticised Nissan NZ's decision to fit luxury <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> instead of airbags in top versions but the company insisted there was not yet sufficient retail or fleet buyer demand.|$|E
500|$|<b>Equipment,</b> <b>items,</b> and talismans can {{be found}} in dungeons. Their {{location}} and effects are randomly generated. Equipment comes in several classes: melee equipment such as swords, claws, arms, dolls, and boots, or ranged weapons such as boomerangs and bows. Items come in several types including pills, shuriken, kunai knives, bombs, caltrops, and restorative items that heal health or SP. Talismans can [...] "stick," [...] or be attached, to equipment to add abilities or stats. A weapon can only have a limited number of talismans stuck to it. Talismans {{can also be used to}} cast magic, which uses SP.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{a variant of}} the {{commercial}} BBC Micro Elite release was created by Angus Duggan by disassembling and modifying the 6502 code from the existing with many extra features, originally titled Elite III but now known as Elite A to minimise confusion. [...] It includes many more ship types, more ship types flyable by the player (who begins in the less capable Adder), cargo delivery missions, some extra <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> and numerous gameplay improvements. Elite A was released publicly in 1997. Like the original game, it can be downloaded free from Ian Bell's web site and played under emulation.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly during green operations, these {{missions}} normally encompass {{surveillance and}} reconnaissance. The <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> carried {{into the field}} are usually cameras, scopes, and most importantly communications. Two recon Marines serve as radiomen in the team. Each team/platoon often brings two field radios {{that are able to}} withstand the elements of seawater, and rugged patrolling as they tread inland—if one radio fails, they resort to the supplemental radio. This is to ensure that vital information can always be sent to the commander, and to the S-3/S-6 shop, or similar intelligence collection agencies. More common in today's infrastructure, much of the intelligence-gathered information is sent to and processed by the Marine Expeditionary Force's [...] "Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence Group" [...] (SRIG).|$|E
