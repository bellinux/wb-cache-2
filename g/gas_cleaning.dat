The station would have utilised pollution abatement and <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E

40|$|As pattern size of {{semiconductor}} device becomes less than 20 nm, {{the removal of}} particles smaller than 10 nm without pattern damages requires new physical dry cleaning technology. CO 2 <b>gas</b> cluster <b>cleaning</b> is an alternative dry cleaning process to meet these cleaning requirements. To demonstrate <b>gas</b> cluster <b>cleaning</b> performance, particle removal efficiency (PRE) and gate structure pattern damages were evaluated. When pressurized and low temperature CO 2 gas was passed through a convergence-divergence (C-D) nozzle, high energy CO 2 gas clusters were generated at high speed in a vacuum atmosphere. The cleaning force of the CO 2 gas cluster {{is related to the}} flow rate of the CO 2 gas. The optimum CO 2 gas flow rate for the particle removal without pattern damage was found to be 6 L/min (LPM). Removal efficiency for 50 nm silica particles was greater than 90 %, and no pattern damage was observed on 60 nm poly-Si and a-Si gate line patterns. It was confirmed that the CO 2 <b>gas</b> cluster <b>cleaning</b> force could be controlled by the CO 2 gas flow rate supplied to nozzle.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess and evaluate the effectiveness, appropriateness and economics of ceramic barrier filter cleaning techniques used for high-temperature and high-pressure particulate filtration. Three potential filter cleaning techniques were evaluated. These techniques include, conventional on-line pulse driven reverse <b>gas</b> filter <b>cleaning,</b> off-line reverse <b>gas</b> filter <b>cleaning</b> and a novel rapid pulse driven filter cleaning. These three ceramic filter cleaning techniques are either presently employed, or being considered for use, in the filtration of coal derived gas streams (combustion or gasification) under high-temperature high-pressure conditions. This study was divided into six subtasks: first principle analysis of ceramic barrier filter cleaning mechanisms; operational values for parameters identified with the filter cleaning mechanisms; evaluation and identification of potential ceramic filter cleaning techniques; development of conceptual designs for ceramic barrier filter systems and ceramic barrier filter cleaning systems for two DOE specified power plants; evaluation of ceramic barrier filter system cleaning techniques; and final report and presentation.

25|$|District heating has various {{advantages}} {{compared to}} individual heating systems. Usually district heating is more energy efficient, due to simultaneous production {{of heat and}} electricity in {{combined heat and power}} generation plants. This has the added benefit of reducing carbon emissions. The larger combustion units also have a more advanced flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> than single boiler systems. In the case of surplus heat from industries, district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for waste gasification technologies {{is to reach}} an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, {{so that it is}} not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.|$|E

25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution.

40|$|If a {{small-scale}} {{clean coal}} fueled power plant is co-fueled with 5 % of creosote-treated used-up sleeper wood, the decontamination by carbonisation at 500 °C in an indirectly heated rotary kiln with the diameter 1. 7 m and effective length 10 m can be realized. It {{should be included}} in the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant" system, which processes coal. It will improve the heat balance of the system, since the carbonisation of wood will deliver a lot of high caloricity pyroligneous vapour to the joint furnace of the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant". Pine wood sleeper sapwood contains 0. 25 % of sulphur, but the average pine sleeper wood (sapwood and heartwood) 0. 05 % of sulphur. Most of the sulphur is lost with the pyroligneous vapour and burned in the furnace. Since the " 3 R Clean Coal Carbonisation Plant" is equipped with a flue <b>gases</b> <b>cleaning</b> system, the SO 2 emission level will not exceed 5 mg/m 3. The charcoal of the sapwood portion of sleepers and that of the average sleeper wood will contain 0. 22 % and 0. 035 % of sulphur, respectively. The increase of the carbonisation temperature does not substantially decrease the sulphur content in charcoal, although it is sufficiently low, and the charcoal can be co-fired with clean coal. The considered process is suitable for small power plants, if the biomass input in the common energy balance is 5 to 10 %.
