The only goal of the game came from Leake – who struck the ball into the net after controlling the ball from a Hayward <b>knock-down</b> from an Askey corner – put Vale into the semi-finals, with the team 'delightedly mobbed' by supporters after the finish.

A minute later, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a <b>knock-down</b> header from Crouch. The first yellow card of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute.

40|$|The {{formation}} of 8 -hydroxyguanine (8 -OH-Gua, 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine) in DNA {{and in the}} nucleotide pool results in G:C→T:A and A:T→C:G substitution mutations, respectively, due {{to the ability of}} 8 -OH-Gua to pair with both C and A. In this study, shuttle plasmid DNAs containing 8 -OH-Gua paired with C and A in the supF gene were transfected into human 293 T cells, in which specialized DNA polymerases were knocked-down. The DNAs replicated in the cells were recovered and then introduced into an indicator strain of Escherichia coli. Mutation analysis indicated that the <b>knock-downs</b> of DNA polymerases η and ζ by siRNAs enhanced the G:C→T:A mutations caused by 8 -OH-Gua:C. The 8 -OH-Gua:C-induced mutation frequency was not further increased by double <b>knock-downs</b> of DNA polymerases η and ζ, suggesting that the two DNA polymerases work in the same pathway. In addition, the reduction of DNA polymerase η slightly decreased the A:T→C:G substitutions caused by 8 -OH-Gua:A. These results suggest that DNA polymerases η and ζ are involved in the bypass of 8 -OH-Gua in human cells...|$|R

He scored the winning goal for Scunthorpe away to Bury on his debut with a close range finish from Andy Crosby's <b>knock-down</b> in the 89th minute, which gave his team a 1–0 victory.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} and the microRNA (miRNA) pathway can induce sequence-specific mRNA degradation and/or translational repression. The {{human genome}} encodes hundreds of miRNAs that can post-transcriptionally repress thousands of genes. Using reporter constructs, we observed that degradation of mRNAs bearing sites imperfectly complementary to the endogenous let- 7 miRNA is considerably stronger in human HEK 293 than HeLa cells. The degradation {{did not result}} from the Ago 2 -mediated endonucleolytic cleavage but it was Dicer- and Ago 2 -dependent. We used this feature of HEK 293 to address {{the size of a}} pool of transcripts regulated by RNA silencing in a single cell type. We generated HEK 293 cell lines depleted of Dicer or individual Ago proteins. The cell lines were used for microarray analyses to obtain a comprehensive picture of RNA silencing. The 3 ′-untranslated region sequences of a few hundred transcripts that were commonly up-regulated upon Ago 2 and Dicer <b>knock-downs</b> showed a significant enrichment of putative miRNA-binding sites. The up-regulation upon Ago 2 and Dicer <b>knock-downs</b> was moderate and we found no evidence, at the mRNA level, for activation of silenced genes. Taken together, our data suggest that, independent of the effect on translation, miRNAs affect levels of a few hundred mRNAs in HEK 293 cells...|$|R

50|$|Research {{into the}} {{interaction}} between diet and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway has shown sugar intake to be negatively correlated with DAF-16 activity and longevity. One study found that glucose ingestion reduced the rate of dauer formation and shortened the life-spans of DAF-2 <b>knock-downs</b> to resemble that of normal C. elegans, suggesting that DAF-16 mediated gene expression associated with longevity is suppressed by glucose ingestion. Wild type C. elegans fed a diet that included 2% glucose showed reduced Daf-16 activity and lifespan was shortened by 20% compared to worms fed on glucose-free media.

40|$|Nested effects {{models have}} been used {{successfully}} for learning subcellular networks from high-dimensional perturbation effects that result from RNA interference (RNAi) experiments. Here, we further develop the basic nested effects model using high-content single-cell imaging data from RNAi screens of cultured cells infected with human rhinovirus. RNAi screens with single-cell readouts are becoming increasingly common, and they often reveal high cell-to-cell variation. As a consequence of this cellular heterogeneity, <b>knock-downs</b> result in variable effects among cells and lead to weak average phenotypes on the cell population level. To address this confounding factor in network inference, we explicitly model the stimulation status of a signaling pathway in individual cells. We extend the framework of nested effects models to probabilistic combinatorial <b>knock-downs</b> and propose NEMix, a nested effects mixture model that accounts for unobserved pathway activation. We analyzed the identifiability of NEMix and developed a parameter inference scheme based on the Expectation Maximization algorithm. In an extensive simulation study, we show that NEMix improves learning of pathway structures over classical NEMs significantly {{in the presence of}} hidden pathway stimulation. We applied our model to single-cell imaging data from RNAi screens monitoring human rhinovirus infection, where limited infection efficiency of the assay results in uncertain pathway stimulation. Using a subset of genes with known interactions, we show that the inferred NEMix network has high accuracy and outperforms the classical nested effects model without hidden pathway activity. NEMix is implemented as part of the R/Bioconductor package 'nem' and available at www. cbg. ethz. ch/software/NEMix...|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{productive}} metabolic engineering strategies involve genetic modifications that cause severe metabolic burden on the host cell. Growth-limiting genetic modifications can be more effective if they are 'switched on' after a population growth phase has been completed. To address this problem we have engineered dynamic regulation using a previously developed synthetic quorum sensing circuit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|The {{environment}} of the northern Plains caused settlers to make special adaptations to meet their need for shelter. Buildings were practical and often temporary.

Instead of requiring experienced carpenters fashioning large timbers with mortise-and-tenon joints as they had often done in the East, balloon framing utilized two-by-fours or similar pieces of lumber that amateur woodworkers could nail together without difficulty.

40|$|Joint {{estimation}} of causal effects from observational and intervention gene expression data Andrea Rau 1, 2 *, Florence Jaffrézic 1, 2 and Grégory Nuel 3, 4 Background: In recent years, {{there has been}} great interest in using transcriptomic data to infer gene regulatory networks. For the time being, methodological development in this area has primarily made use of graphical Gaussian models for observational wild-type data, resulting in undirected graphs that {{are not able to}} accurately highlight causal relationships among genes. In the present work, we seek to improve the {{estimation of}} causal effects among genes by jointly modeling observational transcriptomic data with arbitrarily complex intervention data obtained by performing partial, single, or multiple gene knock-outs or <b>knock-downs.</b> Results: Using the framework of causal Gaussian Bayesian networks, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with a Mallows proposal model and analytical likelihood maximization to sample from the posterior distribution of causal node orderings, and in turn, to estimate causal effects. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm over previously proposed methods is its flexibility to accommodate any kind of intervention design...|$|R
40|$|The {{segmentation}} gene {{network in}} insects can produce equivalent phenotypic outputs despite differences in upstream regulatory inputs between species. We investigate the mechanistic {{basis of this}} phenomenon through a systems-level analysis of the gap gene network in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita (Phoridae). It combines quantification of gene expression at high spatio-temporal resolution with systematic <b>knock-downs</b> by RNA interference (RNAi). Initiation and dynamics of gap gene expression differ markedly between M. abdita and Drosophila melanogaster, while {{the output of the}} system converges to equivalent patterns {{at the end of the}} blastoderm stage. Although the qualitative structure of the gap gene network is conserved, there are differences in the strength of regulatory interactions between species.
