5|$|Safe {{transportation}} of <b>hazardous</b> materials {{is the responsibility}} of the Office of <b>Hazardous</b> Materials within the Pipeline and <b>Hazardous</b> Materials Safety Administration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hazardous</b> {{waste is}} {{generally}} subject to regulation by PHMSA as a <b>hazardous</b> material, but {{is subject to}} additional regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|Iridium in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} <b>hazardous</b> to health {{due to its}} lack of reactivity with tissues; {{there are only about}} 20parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can be <b>hazardous</b> to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.|$|E
5|$|Loader, a Superfund <b>hazardous</b> {{substances}} truck who transports the Pillars in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>hazardous</b> liquids used at {{the site}} {{included}} halogenated solvents {{that may have been}} used for cleaning machine parts.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline {{safety is}} the {{responsibility}} of the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and <b>Hazardous</b> Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).|$|E
5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and <b>hazardous</b> waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is <b>hazardous,</b> prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|Transportation of <b>hazardous</b> {{materials}} {{for commercial purposes}} in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (<b>hazardous</b> materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and <b>Hazardous</b> Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The Command Module {{was found to}} be extremely <b>hazardous</b> and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).|$|E
5|$|Cleanup {{continued}} at the base, including {{the removal of}} <b>hazardous</b> materials, which prevented further waste from entering the nearby Greenlaw Brook, as it received drainage from the flightline and nose dock areas.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are classified}} by the UN as dangerous goods for transportation purposes (US: <b>Hazardous</b> materials). Selecting the Proper Shipping Name (well {{known by the}} abbreviation PSN) {{is a way to}} help ensure that the dangerous goods offered for transport accurately represent the hazards.|$|E
5|$|India has {{the most}} people living in {{conditions}} of slavery, 18 million, {{most of whom are}} in bonded labour. India has the largest number of child labourers under the age of 14 in the world with an estimated 12.6 million children engaged in <b>hazardous</b> occupations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{classified}} as an extremely <b>hazardous</b> substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2008, MTA {{received}} a Ferrara Fire Apparatus <b>Hazardous</b> Materials Response Truck, which went into service three days later. It {{will be used}} {{in the case of a}} chemical or bioterrorist attack.|$|E
5|$|Slog (voiced by Steve Little), a black-furred monster, is {{likewise}} blindly loyal, but lacks critical judgement skills—the more <b>hazardous</b> something is, {{the more likely}} he will be to follow it.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental skill-specific {{training}} {{is also available}} to BSA volunteers to gain knowledge in outdoors skills including camping, hiking, first aid, Leave No Trace, swim safety, climbing safety, <b>hazardous</b> weather, and other skills.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the inner planets. Some of them are potentially <b>hazardous</b> objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} of <b>hazardous</b> goods through the crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain <b>hazardous</b> goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on <b>Hazardous</b> Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates <b>hazardous</b> substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} landing places for yachts visiting Eilean Mòr {{to the east}} and west, although this may be <b>hazardous</b> given the regular heavy swells.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very <b>hazardous</b> waste {{piles of}} roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine {{and created a}} county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.|$|E
5|$|Airplanes began {{being used}} in the Sudan in the 1920s, with revolutionary effect on {{military}} and civilian administration. Flying was <b>hazardous,</b> however. On 4 July 1929 a Fokker FViib/3m owned by the Belgian financier Albert Lowenstein crashed at Mongalla. There were no deaths, but the plane was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr {{is among the}} most common. It is released as a product of 235U, mainly in nuclear plants and during nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a very long half-life (1.53 million years), its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered as highly <b>hazardous.</b>|$|E
5|$|And Yet It Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of <b>hazardous</b> environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>hazardous</b> {{nature of}} lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} {{preference}} for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are <b>hazardous</b> and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} <b>hazardous</b> to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the extent}} of oppression, and destitution, many Zoroastrians ventured to the <b>hazardous</b> journey to India. Those who could not afford the voyage aboard the ships, risked their lives by {{crossing}} the hostile desert on donkeys or even on foot. In India, they were recognized for Sedreh and Kushti and were sheltered by their Parsi brethren. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} or winter storms that require closing Loveland Pass, {{there is a}} procedure in place to allow <b>hazardous</b> material trucks to use the tunnel. Once per hour, the tunnel bores will be closed to regular traffic, and the trucks will be guided through the tunnel in a convoy with escorts.|$|E
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the <b>hazardous</b> post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became an absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely <b>hazardous,</b> especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Empty {{scuba tanks}} or scuba tanks {{pressurized}} {{at less than}} 200kPa are not restricted as <b>hazardous</b> materials. Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if the cylinder valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder and the cylinder has an open end {{to allow for a}} visual inspection inside.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{also worked}} on some {{environmental}} issues. During 1980, {{she tried to}} prevent the federal government from gaining the power to override local laws on <b>hazardous</b> materials transportation, an effort she continued in subsequent years. In , she led passage of a Superfund renewal bill and attacked the Reagan administration's handling of environmental site cleanups.|$|E
5|$|Fewer {{children}} are now employed in <b>hazardous</b> environments, but their employment in non-hazardous jobs, prevalently as domestic help, violates {{the spirit of}} the constitution {{in the eyes of many}} critics and human rights advocates. More than 16.5million {{children are}} in employment. India was ranked 88 out of 159 countries in 2005, according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Mitchell took {{a leading}} role in the Halo Trust (the <b>hazardous</b> areas life-support organization). This {{non-profit}} making organization undertook de-mining operations in former war zones. It employed a core of (mostly British and Commonwealth) de-mining experts and a large number of locally recruited and trained personnel. Most of the Halo personnel were former servicemen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the exhibition buildings, Duxford's 'North Side', {{the area of the}} site north of the A505 road, provides storage for the Imperial War Museum's collecting departments. The stored collections include the film collection, with potentially <b>hazardous</b> nitrate film kept in purpose-built vaults at nearby Ickleton. Other collections stored at Duxford's north side include books, maps, ephemera, photographs, documents and collections of uniforms and equipment.|$|E
