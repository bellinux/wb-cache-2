40|$|The {{pilot study}} served {{to develop and}} {{initially}} evaluate a cognitive behavioural bibliotherapy programme for use in treating Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Administered during 16 one hour appointments with a Psychologist, the programme was associated with significant improvements in anxiety, depression and problem severity. The <b>finalized</b> <b>programme</b> comprised two components - information about anxiety and cognitive behavioural anxiety management guidance. In the main study 46 patients with a primary diagnosis of Generalised Anxiety Disorder were randomly allocated {{to one of two}} treatment conditions - receipt of the full programme or only the information component - or a waiting list control condition. Psychologist administration of the programme took 10 minutes. Patients in receipt of the full programme experienced significantly greater gains than those in the waiting list condition in self assessed anxiety, depression, quality of life, and stress. There were no other between condition differences, but a trend in pre to post changes favouring the full programme. The presence of other co-morbid anxiety or depression conditions did not affect outcome. Clinical improvements in both treatment conditions were associated with improvements in anxiety related health attitudes including self-efficacy. Additionally, clinical improvements in patients in the full programme condition were associated with improvements in coping skills and compliance with the programme. The potential inter-relationship between clinical, attitudinal and coping skills change, and programme compliance were discussed...|$|E

From the start Rwanda was identified as one of four countries where PESTNET hopes to place emphasis on the generation of desired pest management production technology and to test methodologies, technologies and information for validity. In particular the programme and budget now approved will cover proposed collaborative research on {{the assessment of the}} stemborer problem in Rwanda on sorghum and maize - the two important staple food crops in the country's economy.

The government <b>finalized</b> the <b>programme</b> of establishing a university at Khulna on 4 January 1987 and the Khulna University Act was passed in the Bangladesh National Parliament in July 1990. Distinctive law named খুলনা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আইন (The Khulna University Act, 1990) passed in the parliament empowers the university. The university started its formal inauguration of academic activities on 25 November 1991.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the process of ‘muddling through’ by {{following}} the process of developing an analytical and theoretical model in the Elites Production and Poverty (EPP) programme. This is done by following the process of modelling in the research programme. Modelling has always been part of Ole Therkildsens’s modus operandi, right from his key work Watering White Elephants in 1988 to his contribution to <b>finalizing</b> the EPP <b>programme</b> with the 2015 Cambridge University Press book, The Politics of African Industrial Policy. What relates the two works is a three-dimensional model first developed by Korten (1980) for capturing the requirements of the learning approach for project implementation. The EPP, after testing various models in an iterative process, ended up further developing Korten’s model. The EPP initially used the model to depict key analytical processes, but over time the explanatory model became what had to be explained. The complex processes depicted by the model, in other words, went from being an independent variable to being the dependent variable {{in the final stages of}} writing up. The chapter is based on models drawn up from the EPP programme and gives form to the research group’s muddling through towards finalizing the book.

50|$|Quite {{early in}} its life, and {{in line with}} its vision of being an internationally {{competitive}} university, IUO identified external linkages and networking with (older and mentoring-capable) universities and development partners as strategic to the realization of its goals. By March 2007, the university had established linkages with the University of Westminster (UK) {{in the areas of}} staff development, diplomatic studies and ICT and Howard University, USA (telemedicine and teleconferencing), and was <b>finalizing</b> an exchange <b>programme</b> with East Carolina University (USA) in the area of global development. The university was admitted into full membership of the Global University Network for Innovation, GUNI, based in Barcelona, Spain, the European Association for International Education, EAIE, and the Network Towards Unity for Health (Maastricht, the Netherlands) amongst other external affiliations. It was also part of the Consortium of Development Partnerships, CDP, a conglomerate of universities, research institutions, governments and development partners in North America, Europe and West Africa. IUO’s Centre for Presidential Studies coordinated and continues to coordinate Module 8 of the CDP’s project on Local Contexts of Conflict and Peace-building in West Africa that involves researchers from Ghana, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, the Netherlands and Nigeria.|$|R
