5|$|A {{member of}} the Kelgian species, Naydrad looks like a giant caterpillar. Since the {{involuntary}} movements of Kelgians' fur completely show their emotions, the species is <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> both lying and tact. Naydrad is a specialist in rescuing victims of space accidents.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of {{aerodynamics}} prove the bumblebee should be <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> flight, as {{it does not have}} the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{research}} {{is the ability of}} starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Alex is a {{young man}} who is {{depressed}} after his fiancée breaks up with him. Tired of seeing him unhappy, Alex's grandmother sends him Ada, a Tanaka X-5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction.

Several Arabidopsis mutants (stn 7 <b>incapable</b> in phosphorylation <b>of</b> LHC II, stn 8 <b>incapable</b> in phosphorylation <b>of</b> PSII core proteins, stn 7 stn 8 double mutant and npq 4 lacking PsbS and hence qE) were used to investigate the mechanisms involved in low pH induced changes in the thylakoid membrane. We propose that protonation of PsbS at low pH is involved in enhancing energy spillover to PS I...|$|R

5|$|Although the vastly outnumbered Confederates had inflicted {{casualties}} and slowed the Union advance on Saltville, they were <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> halting it. Finding their own path to Saltville's defenses blocked, Breckinridge {{and his men}} retreated further south, while a Union company advanced. Saltville fell to a night attack on December 2021 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces.|$|E

After Tony's former mistress calls their home, Carmela throws Tony out. Tony is approached by Johnny Sack with a proposal to murder Carmine, which Tony turns down.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E

50|$|Foggymindedness (rmugs-pa) {{is a part}} of naivety (moha). It is a heavy {{feeling of}} body and mind that makes the mind unclear, unserviceable, and <b>incapable</b> either <b>of</b> giving rise to a {{cognitive}} appearance of its object or of apprehending the object correctly. When the mind actually becomes unclear, due to foggymindedness, this is mental dullness (bying-ba).|$|R
5|$|In December 2016, Prime7 {{transferred}} its playout {{facilities to}} MediaHub Australia {{located within the}} Sydney suburb of Ingleburn. The facility is {{a joint venture between}} public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation and rival regional network WIN Television.

5|$|In {{the case}} of species with two {{permanent}} sexes, including {{but not limited to}} Earth-humans, the stories state that females are psychologically <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> allowing their psyches to be violated to the extent required by the educator tapes. However, in one of the later books a very assertive non-human female character accidentally acquires several sets of memories which cannot be erased, and adjusts to this with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
50|$|In {{exchange}} for his support, Emperor Otto IV raised Dipold to the title of magister capitaneus totius Apuliae et Terre Laboris and made him Duke of Spoleto between 6 or 10 February 1209. He was <b>incapable,</b> however, <b>of</b> maintaining his authority over his vast territory. In Pisa in November, it was probably he who convinced Otto to invade Sicily.|$|R

5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are <b>incapable</b> <b>of</b> bioluminescence.|$|E
