By 1954, magnetic core memory was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, including the Williams tube. It went on to dominate the field through the mid-1970s. A key feature of the American UNIVAC I system of 1951 was the implementation of a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed tape unit, for non-volatile storage. Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.In 1952, IBM publicly announced the IBM 701 Electronic <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Machine,</b> the first in its successful 700/7000 series and its first IBM mainframe computer.

5000|$|In the {{beginnings}} of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> technology, the hardware was just a collection of modules, and the functions of those modules had {{to be linked to}} accommodate different calculating operations.

Feature {{selection is}} of great importance in pattern classification, medical <b>data</b> <b>processing,</b> <b>machine</b> learning, and data mining applications. In this paper, continuous particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection in wrapper based method, and the k-nearest neighbor classification serve as a fitness function of PSO for the classification problem. The PSO based feature selection method {{is applied to the}} features extracted from the Lung CT scan images. Experimental results show that modified PSO feature selection method simplifies features effectively and obtains a higher classification accuracy compared to the basic PSO Feature selection method...|$|E
