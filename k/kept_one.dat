5|$|From 1967, Oslo Sporveier {{transferred}} all its trams to Bærumsbanen, {{where they}} remained in use until 1985. The class {{has been involved}} in several fatal incidents, including the Strømsveien tram fire in 1958. Six trams (prototype no 163, nos 166, 170, 196 and 199) remain at the Oslo Tramway Museum; whilst Oslo Sporveier has kept two and converted them to maintenance vehicles (nos 185 and 198), painted them yellow with zebra stripes. They also <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> themselves as a veteran tram (no 183).|$|E
5|$|Four units (619, 633, 641 and 643) {{were sold}} to the United Nations and was put into service in Kosovo, in what has since become the Kosovo Railways. Four units (622, 626, 630 and 631) {{were sold to}} an {{operator}} in Sicily, Italy. The Norwegian National Rail Administration bought one unit (628) for maintenance, and has painted it yellow. The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has preserved three units, of which two (602 and 616) were operated by GM-Gruppen and one (615) is kept for spare parts. NSB has <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> unit as reserve at Ål Station. The remaining units have been scrapped, put aside or sold as spare part units.|$|E
5|$|In January 1016, Mansur fled Aleppo {{after the}} citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, revolted and {{recognized}} Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over Aleppo. According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored {{his share of}} Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join Mansur, but <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of the latter's daughters, whom he married. Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} three {{boys from the}} small Potos village disobey their Elder's {{instructions}} and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure {{is said to be}} <b>kept.</b> <b>One</b> of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves as a gesture of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to resist {{the effects of the}} Twilight Woods if <b>one</b> <b>kept</b> <b>one's</b> mind constantly focused on one's identity and purpose. When Twig was lost there with the crew of the Stormchaser, this is how he managed to retain his wits long enough to escape. The Twilight Woods also had no effect on shrykes, possibly because their plumage protected them from its effects. But mainly because of the shryke's double-eyelids, which made them immune to the hallucinations.|$|R

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
25|$|Lallemand's 700-strong brigade {{consisted}} of the 17th and 27th Dragoon Regiments. Slade also commanded 700 sabres from the 1st Royal Dragoons and 3rd Prince of Wales Dragoon Guards Regiments. The two forces deployed opposite one another, but Lallemand <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of his six squadrons in reserve, {{out of sight of}} the British.|$|E
25|$|Despite this failure, {{which was}} {{lightened}} {{by the fact}} that he only <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> part of the ship, Almeida recovered quickly. As captain of the schooner Caroline, and later the Kemp, Almeida captured over 35 British ships and earned $300,000 in net profit. His brilliant performance as a sailor and tactician also enriched his funding partners and made him a war hero, especially when, in the winter of 1814, the Kemp successfully attacked a convoy of nine British ships.|$|E
6000|$|Spenser's contemporaries, writing lyrics or plays full of lyrical moments, write a verse more delicately {{organised}} {{than his}} and crowd more meaning into a phrase than he, {{but they could}} not have <b>kept</b> <b>one's</b> attention through so long a poem. A friend who has a fine ear told me the other day that she had read all Spenser with delight and yet could remember only four lines. When she repeated them they were from the poem by Matthew Roydon, which is bound up with Spenser because it is a commendation of Sir Philip Sidney: ...|$|R

25|$|When the War of 1812 began {{between the}} United States and Great Britain, Almeida participated as a {{privateer}} {{in the fight}} against the British. Acting wisely, he brought in 16 investors who bought his schooner Joseph & Mary, which weighed 139 tons, and only <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> share. The Joseph & Mary, under Captain William Westcott, was hit by friendly fire, and after capturing only two ships (the Piscataqua and a sloop) was captured on November 25, 1812, near Cuba by the British frigate HMS Narcissus.|$|E
25|$|Like so many others, Étienne was {{eventually}} {{forced to flee}} Paris because of {{his opposition to the}} fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.|$|E
25|$|When {{the task}} was {{finished}} Uthman <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> copy in Medina and sent others to Kufa, Baṣra, Damascus, and, according to some accounts, Mecca, and ordered that all other variant copies of the Quran to be destroyed. This was done everywhere except in Kufa, where some scholars argue that, Ibn Masʿūd and his followers refused. It is also important that the compilation of the Quran {{during the time of}} Caliph Abu Bakr which was inherited by Caliph Umar's daughter Hafsa (and a wife of Muhammad) was not destroyed but was passed back to her. This would imply that the first compilation, during the time of Abu Bakr, was not at variation with the Uthmanic compilation.|$|E

25|$|In late May 1944 {{the brigade}} was {{withdrawn}} from Italy {{and returned to}} Egypt. In August 1944 the brigade was renamed Force 140, later Arkforce and dismounted from its tanks. The 40th and 50th RTR were retrained as infantry but the 46th RTR was reorganized with one squadron of armoured cars and one squadron of infantry, this being attached to the 50th RTR but <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> squadron of Shermans. It arrived at Piraeus on 12 October 1944 {{as part of the}} peacekeeping force keeping order in Greece when the Germans withdrew. The 23rd Armoured Brigade remained in Greece until the end of World War II in Europe, having been restored to their tanks by the end of January 1945.|$|E
25|$|In June 1699 Kidd {{was stopped}} on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the {{permission}} of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, he buried $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it's on private property.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning after}} John’s death {{huge numbers of}} the townspeople of Úbeda entered the monastery to view his body; in the crush, many {{were able to take}} home parts of his habit. He was {{initially}} buried at Úbeda, but, {{at the request of the}} monastery in Segovia, his body was secretly moved there in 1593. The people of Úbeda, however, unhappy at this change, sent representative to petition the pope to move the body back to its original resting place. Pope Clement VIII, impressed by the petition, issued a Brief on 15 October 1596 ordering the return of the body to Ubeda. Eventually, in a compromise, the superiors of the Discalced Carmelites decided that the monastery at Úbeda would receive one leg and one arm of the corpse from Segovia (the monastery at Úbeda had already <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> leg in 1593, and the other arm had been removed as the corpse passed through Madrid in 1593, to form a relic there). A hand and a leg remain visible in a reliquary at the Oratory of San Juan de la Cruz in Úbeda, a monastery built in 1627 though connected to the original Discalced monastery in the town founded in 1587.|$|E

Balancing himself cautiously, he walked along the spar and melted in the dark. But in a few moments there was a splash and Marston knew he had dropped from the bowsprit's end into shallow water. Somehow this was soothing and he went to the cabin. In an hour or two Wyndham returned and when they lighted their pipes after supper Marston remarked: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were other}} moose on the lake, {{all of them}} as {{uncertain}} as the big cow and her calf. Probably {{most of them had}} never seen a man before our arrival, and it <b>kept</b> <b>one's</b> expectations on tiptoe to know what they would do when they saw the strange two-legged creature for the first time. If a moose smelled me before I saw him, he would make off quietly into the woods, as all wild creatures do, and watch from a safe distance. But if I stumbled upon him unexpectedly, when the wind brought no warning to his nostrils, he was fearless, usually, and full of curiosity.|$|R

Weinstock noted that it was unusual for an actor in a film to do this. Reynolds <b>kept</b> <b>one</b> of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign. Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a similar process to that used by Weta Digital for the film.|$|E
