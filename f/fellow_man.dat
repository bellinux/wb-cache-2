These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH {{at the same time}} as the official seal. Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's <b>fellow</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as a <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> of science, who is replacing {{components that}} form {{a time machine}} that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E

25|$|LaHaye {{believed}} that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I am convinced that it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|The new {{religions}} (in particular, Calvinism {{and other}} more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully using hard earned money and identified {{the purchase of}} luxuries as a sin. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of icons. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to charity was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.|$|E
25|$|As {{proud as}} Waramaug was of his {{imposing}} palace, {{he was even}} prouder of the light of his life, his lovely daughter, Lillinonah. Taught from birth to cultivate those virtues most revered by her father -- compassion for one's <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> loyalty to family and tribe and sensitivity to the beauties of Nature -- Lillinonah was, {{at the age of}} eighteen, a young woman whose humanity matched her grace and beauty. From near and far the young braves came, as moths to the flame, to pay homage to Lillinonah -- and perhaps win her hand in marriage. But first, of course, each had to pass muster with old Waramaug, and that was no simple matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial of}} Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, Apology {{is among the}} most {{frequently}} read of his works. In the Apology, Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a sophist and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the Oracle at Delphi. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.|$|E
500|$|Accounts {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{focused on}} the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his <b>fellow</b> <b>man.</b> Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Strang kept {{a rather}} {{profound}} personal diary, written partly {{in a secret}} code that was not deciphered until over one hundred {{years after it was}} authored (by Strang's own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California). [...] This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to [...] "rival Caesar or Napoleon" [...] and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a general or member of the state legislature, which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his quest to be someone of importance. [...] However, Strang's diary equally reveals a heartfelt desire to be of service to his <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.|$|E

500|$|Several {{commentators}} have described Disney {{as a cultural}} icon. On his death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those [...] "considered valuable in American Christian society", which include [...] "individualism, decency,... love for our <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> fair play and toleration". Disney's obituary in The Times calls the films [...] "wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty". Journalist Bosley Crowther argues that Disney's [...] "achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly {{be compared to the}} most successful industrialists in history." [...] Correspondent Alistair Cooke calls Disney a [...] "folk-hero... the Pied Piper of Hollywood", while Gabler considers Disney [...] "reshaped the culture and the American consciousness".

500|$|Reverend Lovejoy's {{sermon on}} [...] "" [...] almost sends the entire {{congregation}} to sleep. After church Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield dump {{to dispose of}} their old Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent known as Mr. Sparkle. The face of the character on the box of the detergent strongly resembles Homer. Meanwhile, Marge becomes concerned with Lovejoy's lack of enthusiasm about helping people. He explains to Marge that he was enthusiastic about the ministry and helping his <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> when he first arrived in Springfield. However, his passion for helping people gradually degraded as he dealt with Ned Flanders and his constant complaints over trivial and common issues. Marge begins working for the Church as [...] "The Listen Lady", listening to people's problems and helping solve them. Reverend Lovejoy soon realizes his inadequacy and begins to feel depressed. While he is alone in the church the stained glass images of saints appear and chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation.|$|E
500|$|Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians {{has been the}} subject of {{constant}} panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for Variety, said that the network: [...] "widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows." [...] Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times compared the show to reality series Gene Simmons Family Jewels and exclaimed that: [...] "the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: [...] "Those of us who watch this show [...] want to believe that these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{believed}} that secular government should peacefully coexist with religion, {{and he became}} a seminal figure in applying {{the separation of church}} and state. [...] Historian Thomas Bicknell, one of Clarke's most ardent supporters, wrote that at the time of the Puritan settlement of New England that [...] "nowhere on the face of the earth and among civilized men, did civil and soul-liberty exist. [...] Its first clear, full, deliberate, organized and permanent establishment in the world can now be distinctly traced to the Colony of Rhode Island, on the island of Aquidneck, in the Narragansett Bay, under the leadership and inspiration of Dr. [...] John Clarke, the true Founder". [...] Historian Louis Asher wrote, [...] "It hardly seems arguable that Dr. Clarke was the first one to bring democracy to the New World by means of Rhode Island." [...] Bicknell also asserted that Clarke was the [...] "recognized founder and father of the Aquidneck Plantations, the author of the Compact of Portsmouth and leading spirit in the organization and administration of the island towns. [...] Historian Edward Peterson wrote that Clarke was a man [...] "whose moral character has never been surpassed, and his piety never been questioned." [...] Asher made this final assessment of Clarke: [...] "As a man, Clarke lived for others. [...] Like many men of the past, he was selfless and uncomplaining. [...] Despite his sectarian religious views, he gave more for his <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> than he received." ...|$|E

The Center opened in March 1967. Graboi explained [...] "The League of Spiritual Discovery had only two commandments: Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy <b>fellow</b> <b>man,</b> and Thou shalt not prevent thy <b>fellow</b> <b>man</b> from altering his own consciousness." [...] Graboi accepted the position as director to disseminate information about the use and misuse of psychedelics, in order to minimize their ill effects. Leary thought their work together could educate people about the constructive use of LSD, as well as serve as a rescue center. Leary and Alpert gave free weekly talks at the center, and other guest speakers included Ralph Metzner and Allen Ginsberg.|$|E
