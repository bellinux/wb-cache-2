5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, [...] "It was a tough decision for me. It {{took me a long time}} to be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E

500|$|The Quick and the Deads dismal {{box office}} {{performance}} {{can be attributed}} to competition from Billy Madison, The Brady Bunch Movie, Just Cause and Heavyweights. Director Sam Raimi later blamed himself and his visual style for the film's failure. [...] "I was very confused after <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> movie. For a number of years I thought, I'm like a dinosaur. I couldn't change with the material." [...] TriStar Pictures also showed The Quick and the Dead as an [...] "out-of-competition" [...] film at the May 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Additionally, Stone was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, but lost to Angela Bassett in Strange Days. A novelization written by Jack Curtis was published by HarperCollins in September 1995. The Region 1 DVD release came in September 1998.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the scandal, actress Brigitte Nielsen {{came forward}} and stated that she too {{had an affair with}} Schwarzenegger while he was in a {{relationship}} with Shriver, saying, [...] "Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is dead serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on." [...] When asked in 2014 [...] "Of all the things you are famous for … which are you least proud of?", Schwarzenegger replied [...] "I'm least proud of the mistakes <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> caused my family pain and split us up".|$|E

You were not among those who came out, and gave {{themselves}} up, or among those who were captured when the city was taken; for I had careful inquiry made, thinking it possible {{that you might have}} lost my ring, and been unable to obtain access to me; then, at last, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> sure <b>that</b> you had fallen.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1953, Miller {{traveled}} to Hawaii and rejoined her I Walk Alone costar, Burt Lancaster. She spent 10 days in the islands. She was cast as Georgette, Donna Reed's roommate in From Here to Eternity. But most of her footage {{ended up on the}} cutting room floor: [...] "'I don't even say <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> one; I'm hardly in it. I think you see my arm; that's about it' (laughs)." [...] Miller was more impressed by the performances of Frank Sinatra and Montgomery Clift, whom she watched performing before the camera. Production ran March 7–May 5, 1953. On July 27, 1953, Miller finally married William Schuyler in Santa Barbara. That October, it was announced that the Schuylers were expecting their first baby. Their daughter, Linda Elizabeth, was born on February 22, 1954.|$|E
2500|$|With [...] "Glaciers of Ice" [...] as its B-Side, the album's second single [...] "Criminology" [...] was {{released}} June 26, 1995, almost {{one year after}} [...] "Heaven and Hell." [...] It had notable chart success, as it peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 5 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. Producer RZA later illustrated [...] "That was me trying to produce like a DJ, produce a breakbeat. Ghost actually asked me to make one of those beats. You listen to old DJ tapes. That's how <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> song, and he wanted this shit {{to sound like a}} breakbeat. He had a rhyme that he knew was going to change the game - that was the verse that got him recognized. Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs called up and was like [...] "Yo, he killed that shit.

2500|$|Casualty@Holby City episodes have {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The 2004 Christmas crossover {{was named the}} season's [...] "Best Christmas Drama" [...] by The Sun, while Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard selected the first episode as a televisual [...] "Pick of the Day". The inaugural crossover was {{named one of the}} [...] "Best TV shows for Christmas & New Year" [...] in The Mirror, receiving generally favourable reviews by Mirror writers Jane Simon and Jim Shelley—despite the former lambasting the realism of the plot: [...] "The building collapses, there's a little girl upstairs about to have a heart transplant, the tanker's leaking fuel and there's a velociraptor loose in radiology. Sorry, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> last one up."—and the latter commenting that [...] "Casualty@Holby City was deeply weird, like watching Casualty on acid." [...] Similarly, Daniel Davies of The Western Mail also selected the episodes as dramatic highlights of the Christmas season, despite going on to discuss the aptness of the BBC's press release describing the two episodes as [...] "thrown together." ...|$|E
