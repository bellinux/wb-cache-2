40|$|International audienceListening {{music with}} a headset is now a {{classical}} feature of mobile phones. A linear amplifier is still employed to drive the headset as the audio quality must challenge dedicated audio players with somewhat 100 dB of signal-to-noise ratio. This feature must also have the lowest impact on the platform autonomy, size, and cost. A symmetrical power supply is required by such audio amplifiers due to the standard jack connector of headsets. Using an <b>inductive</b> <b>switch</b> mode power supply (SMPS) is the most energy efficient solution to supply audio amplifiers from a battery. Classically, two dc/dc converters are employed to generate the required two symmetrical supply rails from a standard Lithium-Ion battery. It is {{at the cost of}} numerous bulky and expensive external components. A solution {{to reduce the number of}} external passive components is to consider a single-inductor, bipolar-outputs, (SIBO) dc/dc converter. An early prototype of such a converter has been realized on a 130 -nm silicon process and offers primary results, nonoptimal but promising. The feedback control structure is studied based on a small signal model that serves to define the pairing of the loops for designing a decentralized controller. A set of controllers is designed by a pole placement technique and transient performances are demonstrated on audio patterns thanks to a piecewise linear model of the converter. Eighty percent peak efficiency is measured with the primary demonstrator but latter simulation results yield an expected improvement to 90 %. The audio specifications appear very constraintful and the proposed SMPS does not meet entirely the latter figures. Limitations are detailed. However, many other applications can benefit from the proposed SIBO dc/dc converte...|$|E

40|$|Power modules {{typically}} {{comprise of}} several power devices {{connected in parallel}} {{for the purpose of}} delivering high current capability. This is especially the case in SiC where small active area and low current MOSFETs are the only option due to defect density control and yield issues in the epitaxial growth of SiC wafers. Electrothermal variations between parallel connected devices can emerge from manufacturing variability, non-uniform degradation rates, variation in gate driving just to mention a few. The impact of electrothermal variation between parallel-connected devices as a function of device technology is thus important to consider especially since failure of the power module requires only failure in a single device. Furthermore, the impact of these electrothermal variations in parallel-connected devices on the total electrothermal ruggedness of the power module under anomalous switching conditions like unclamped <b>inductive</b> <b>switching</b> is important to consider for the different device technologies. In this thesis, the impact of initial junction temperature variation, switching rates and thermal boundary conditions between parallel-connected diodes have been evaluated for SiC Schottky and silicon PiN diodes under clamped and unclamped <b>inductive</b> <b>switching.</b> Finite element simulations have been used to support the experimental measurements. Similar studies have been performed in CoolMOS super-junction MOSFETs, silicon IGBTs and SiC power MOSFETs. New insights regarding the failure of parallel connected devices under unclamped <b>inductive</b> <b>switching</b> have been revealed from the models and measurements. Overall, the thesis makes a major contribution in the understanding of the electrothermal performance of parallel connected devices for different transistor and diode technologies. ...|$|R
