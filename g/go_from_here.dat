Brian McNair, author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire (2002) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had [...] "porno elegance" [...] and that [...] "Sex is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence". Priya Elan from The Guardian, wrote: [...] "That the Sex book came after a record-breaking album and tour felt like a shrinkwrapped curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique". Elan felt that the book was part of a [...] "slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as 'Oh Father' (from 1989's Like a Prayer) and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in [...] In Bed With Madonna".|$|E
