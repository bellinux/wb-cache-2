Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings.

Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test.

[...] The film was shot in <b>dual</b> <b>camera</b> 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s.

40|$|Abstract. The {{reconstruction}} {{quality of}} in-line holography {{suffers from the}} superposition of twin images, which blurs the details and degrades {{the quality of the}} object wavefront reconstruction. We present an iterative reconstruction method to eliminate twin image and truthfully retrieve the object wavefront. This algorithm has a better elimination effect and more rapid rate of convergence than other phase retrieval methods. An experimental setup was built with <b>dual</b> <b>cameras</b> recording the holograms simultaneously, thus this technique can be employed for investigating fast dynamic phenomina. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using different samples...|$|R

A second-order polynomial has been utilized in order to align and test the RGB and NIR images to attain subpixel accuracy. The system was implemented in the matrix laboratory (MATLAB) and the developed algorithm was verified for accuracy considering different environmental conditions and scenarios...|$|R
