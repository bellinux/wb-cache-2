Several documents confirm the prayer. According to the Iqbal al-A'mal, Sayyed Ibn Tawus narrated the Arafah prayer from Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shia, on the authority of Iyas, son of Salamah ibn al-Akwa through a chain of transmission. Abbas Qumi mentioned the prayer in his book entitled Mafatih al-Janan. Kaf'ami narrated the Arafah prayer in his al-Balad al-Amin, but in these works the last folio is missing. The authenticity of this Du'a was reviewed in Shia references such as the Mesbah al-Zayer of Sayyed Ibn Tawus, the Bihar al-Anwar of Allama Majlisi and the Kitab al-Kafi of Muhammad ibn Ya'qūb al-Kulaynī. One Sunni scholar, Shadhili Sufi master Ibn Ata Allah, studied this prayer.|$|R

5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for <b>Glory</b> <b>to</b> teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
