5|$|The castle was {{embedded}} within an ornamental landscape, with two gardens laid {{out at the}} same time as the castle was founded and a third created later.

5|$|Tourism {{started in}} Whitby during the Georgian period and {{developed}} further on {{the arrival of}} the railway in 1839. Its attraction as a tourist destination is enhanced by its proximity to the high <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North York Moors National Park, its Heritage Coastline and by its association with the horror novel Dracula.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the castle was guarded by five men. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged the town and the castle was overcome by artillery positioned on the higher <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlooking hill behind it. An earthwork fort, called Gallants Bower, may subsequently have been built to protect this vulnerable position; an alternative explanation is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth. He first took the town, then Gallants Bower, before forcing the surrender of Sir Hugh Pollard, the castle's commander, the following day. The Carews' house was probably badly damaged during the attack.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1st century, a {{distinct}} equestrian group, non-Italian and military in character, became established. This {{was a result}} of the established custom whereby the emperor elevated the primuspilus (chief centurion) of each legion to equestrian rank on completion of his year in office. This resulted in some 30 career soldiers, mostly non-Italian and risen from the ranks, joining the aristocracy each year. Far less wealthy than their Italian counterparts, many such equites belonged to families that provided career soldiers for generations. Prominent among them were Romanised Illyrians, the descendants of the Illyrian-speaking tribes that inhabited the Roman provinces of Pannonia (W Hungary/Croatia/Slovenia), Dalmatia (Croatia/Bosnia) and Moesia Superior (Serbia), together with the neighbouring Thracians of Moesia Inferior (N Bulgaria) and Macedonia provinces. From the time of Domitian (ruled 81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian and Thracian provinces became the most important recruiting <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auxilia and later the legions.|$|E

5|$|Constant {{shelling}} had {{blocked the}} Ravebeek stream, creating an impassable swamp directly between {{the boundary of}} the 3rd Canadian and the 4th Canadian Divisions, necessitating a two-prong attack. The 3rd Canadian Division was assigned the wider advance on the left, which included the sharply rising <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellevue spur. In the more restricted ground south of the Ravebeek stream, the 4th Canadian Division would occupy advanced positions in no man's land {{before the start of}} the offensive and take Decline Copse, which straddled the Ypres–Roulers railway. Currie planned the attack with extensive depth in resources. The remaining units of the 8th, 9th and 10th Canadian Infantry Brigades were placed in support, while the 7th, 11th and 12th Canadian Infantry Brigades were held in divisional and corps reserve. The 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions were in army reserve.|$|E

During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte IS' home <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen.
