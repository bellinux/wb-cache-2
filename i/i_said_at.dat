500|$|Speaking to Australian {{radio station}} 2Day FM, Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the title for their next album: [...] "is much easier to pronounce." [...] Martin debunked speculation that they were {{taking a break from}} touring by saying, [...] "This three-year break idea only came about because <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> a gig in Australia that we might not be back there for three years. That’s probably true, but that’s just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break.” ...|$|E
500|$|When Warner Bros. {{shut down}} {{pre-production}} of The Fountain in 2002, Aronofsky reserved rights {{to publish a}} graphic novel based on the script that was not produced. He said, [...] "I {{knew it was a}} hard film to make, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> least if Hollywood fucks me over at least I'll make a comic book out of it." [...] He shopped the story to Vertigo Comics and met comic book artist Kent Williams, whose illustrations impressed him. Aronofsky hired Williams to create the graphic novel, and Ari Handel, co-writer for the film, provided Williams with research, photographs, and images on [...] "Mayans, astronomy, pulsars, and all kinds of cool stuff" [...] for the graphic novel's design. Aronofsky gave Williams the freedom to interpret the story as the artist saw fit.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with TheWrap, Freeman {{was asked if}} he considered himself atheist or agnostic. [...] He replied, [...] "It's a hard question because as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} United States ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza visited Nakhchivan but was inexplicably refused access to Julfa by Azerbaijani authorities. Bryza {{had intended to}} investigate the cemetery but instead was told by government authorities that they would help facilitate a new trip in the coming months. In a statement released by the US embassy in Baku, Bryza stated that [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time the cemetery destruction was reported, the desecration of cultural sites [...] especially a cemetery [...] is a tragedy, which we deplore, regardless of where it happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins' albums Monuments to an Elegy (2014) {{and their}} {{upcoming}} tenth album (2016) will conclude the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project. Corgan is unsure when Teargarden by Kaleidyscope {{will result in}} a box set, as originally announced, but it could include up to approximately 60 previously unreleased demos recorded for the project. He also stated that the future of the band is up in the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the Teargarden project, I looked at it like, OK, I'm going to take this journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end. In big capital letters. Goodbye, I'm done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're Minnie Moore, I suppose?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> gazing <b>at</b> her admiringly. Her sweet, frank {{smile and}} apple-blossom cheek somehow {{inspired}} me with confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah,” <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> the mangled dummy {{like the}} model of some atrocious murder. “Ah, the fortune. But that can be left alone.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{its home}} country, Greek critic Dimitris Danikas gave the film {{a rating of}} eight out of ten ("with enthusiasm") and characterizes it as [...] "black, surreal, nightmarish." [...] He {{believes}} that Dogtooth is as important for Greek cinema as Theodoros Angelopoulos' 1970 film Reconstitution. He {{goes on to say}} [...] "Lanthimos composes and goes from one level to another like a wildcat-creator, constantly and continuously maintaining the same rigorous style. Hence the aphasia; hence the uniformity; hence the submission and the scheduled mass culture; hence also the serial killer; hence, however, the disobedience, the anarchy. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the beginning: Dogtooth has the surrealism of Buñuel, the scalpel of Haneke, the underground horror of a thriller without the splatter. Perfect." [...] Danikas characterized Dogtooth's Academy Award nomination as [...] "the greatest Greek triumph of recent years." [...] Columnist Dimitris Bouras, writing for Kathimerini, refers to [...] "the beneficial effects that the prestigious award could have" [...] and believes that the nomination reveals three interesting facts: [...] "1) in Greece we need to be extroverts (and not only in cinema), 2) exportable product is whatever has an identity, 3) Dogtooths nomination is like an investment – manna from the heaven of Hollywood for the developing Greek cinema." ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{a curious}} story altogether, I admit. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the beginning, I do not myself believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>at</b> him, with my disgust {{speaking}} {{in my face}} (Heaven forgive me!), [...] "I call it nothing less than murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, <b>at</b> least," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{catching}} <b>at</b> this straw, [...] "will {{you promise}} that you won't become engaged {{to any one}} without my consent?" ...|$|R
