The normal escape sequence is three plus signs ("+++"), and to disambiguate it from possible real data, a <b>guard</b> <b>timer</b> is used: {{it must be}} preceded by a pause, not have any pauses between the plus signs, and {{be followed by a}} pause; by default, a [...] "pause" [...] is one second and [...] "no pause" [...] is anything less.|$|E

In the model, any transition in the specification can be made conditional {{on a set of}} running timers. Depending on the path taken to reach an edge, the values of the timer variables may render the traversal of the edge infeasible. The presented modeling technique, combined with the INconsistencies DEtection and ELimination (INDEEL) algorithms, allows the generation of feasible test sequences. The model also o#ers the flexibility to define timer lengths as variables, and have the INDEEL find the appropriate timer ranges. An approach to apply this new methodology to SDL timed extensions (<b>guarding</b> and delaying <b>timers)</b> is presented...|$|R
