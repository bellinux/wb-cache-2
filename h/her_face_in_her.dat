25|$|Machali, born in 1996 or 1997, was the {{dominant}} cub in {{a litter of}} three females. She inherited her name from her mother, Machali I, who was also named fish due to a fish-shaped mark on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> first two years, she started hunting on her own and took over {{a part of her}} mother's territory.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E
500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] "he thought {{her to be a}} harlot; for she had covered her face," [...] the Gemara {{questioned}} how that could be so, for the Rabbis considered covering one's face an act of modesty. Rabbi Eleazar explained that Tamar had covered <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father-in-law's house (and thus Judah had never seen her face and did not recognize her), for Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that every daughter-in-law who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets should issue from her. In support of that proposition, the Gemara noted that kings descended from Tamar through David. And prophets descended from Tamar, as [...] says, [...] "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz," [...] and Rabbi Levi taught that there is a tradition that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah the King of Judah, and thus a descendant of David and thus of Tamar..|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is an array of love songs, with songs such as [...] "My Boy" [...] and [...] "Girl" [...] portraying Duffy in a {{protective}} manner, with respect to her lover. On [...] "Breath Away", Duffy laments that her lover is [...] "taking her breath away." [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] questions the difficulties involved with falling in love. Elsewhere, Duffy also took inspiration from her own life experiences. [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] was subconsciously written about Duffy's friend who [...] "lost her mum aged ten". Duffy continued, [...] "she told me they played [...] "Unchained Melody" [...] at her mum's funeral. I now realise my lyric comes from seeing my friend at the school disco, shaking, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, while the other kids were smooching to this song". The following track, [...] "Keeping My Baby" [...] was written in a similar way, as Duffy only released the song is {{about the fact that}} [...] "one aunt told her she'd end up a single mother on benefits", as it is [...] "sung {{from the point of view}} of a pregnant girl".|$|E
2500|$|Yuan Shao lost to his rival, Cao Cao, at the Battle of Guandu in 200 CE {{and died}} two years later. After his death, his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their father's vast domain. When the Yuan {{brothers}} were exhausted from their wars against each other, Cao Cao attacked and defeated them, swiftly conquering the territories {{that used to be}} controlled by the Yuans. In 204, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shang at the Battle of Ye and his forces occupied the city. Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, entered Yuan Shao's residence and met Lady Liu (Yuan Shao's widow) and Lady Zhen. Lady Zhen was so terrified that she buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother-in-law's lap. Cao Pi said, [...] "What's going on, Madam Liu? Ask that lady to lift up her head!" [...] Cao Pi was very impressed and entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty when he saw her. His father allowed him to marry her later. Another account of this incident stated that Lady Liu and Lady Zhen were in Yuan Shang's residence when Cao Pi entered. Lady Zhen's hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her mother-in-law. When Cao Pi asked, Lady Liu told him the woman behind her was Yuan Xi's wife. Cao Pi was so entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty that he married her and treated her well. Yuan Xi was still alive at the time. Yuan Shang came to join him after his defeat by Cao Cao. In 207, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Xi, Yuan Shang and their Wuhuan allies at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, after which they fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang. Gongsun Kang feared that they would become a threat to him, so he lured them into a trap, executed them, and sent their heads to Cao Cao.|$|E
