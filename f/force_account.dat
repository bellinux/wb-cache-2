5000|$|Some historians see ancient Japanese warrior traditions as a {{major factor}} in the {{resistance}} in the Japanese military to the idea of surrender. According to one Air <b>Force</b> <b>account,</b> The Japanese code of bushido—'the way of the warrior'—was deeply ingrained. The concept of Yamato-damashii equipped each soldier with a strict code: never be captured, never break down, and never surrender. Surrender was dishonorable. Each soldier was trained to fight to the death and was expected to die before suffering dishonor. Defeated Japanese leaders preferred to take their own lives in the painful samurai ritual of seppuku (called hara kiri in the West). Warriors who surrendered were not deemed worthy of regard or respect.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910 the Reclamation Service {{began to}} {{consider}} another storage facility further east on the Boise River. After several surveys, engineers decided upon the Arrowrock site which {{had previously been}} {{the site of a}} private irrigation venture under the direction of Arthur De Wint Foote yet failed for lack of funding. The Arrowrock site is at the confluence of the main channel and the south fork. This was to be the most ambitious project to date for Reclamation. At 348 ft, Arrowrock would be the largest concrete arch dam in the world. Prior to construction considerable preparatory work would need to be completed. As the structure was some 20 mi up the Boise River from the Boise River Diversion Dam, routing supplies to the worksite would be a massive undertaking unto itself. The Reclamation Service elected to construct a new rail line on the old wagon road leading north to Idaho City. The railroad would begin at the Barberton mill near the Diversion Dam and extend to through a winding canyon up to Arrowrock. Even before the dam had been approved, Reclamation began work on the rail line. [...] Some significant problems existed with construction of the railroad. The Barberton Lumber Company owned the roads right-of-way. This meant the Reclamation Service needed to come to an agreement over ownership of the rail line. In an unprecedented move, the government agreed to lease the track from Barberton but run the actual locomotive. Part of this agreement stipulated that the line would remain a common carrier. This made the Arrowrock & Boise Railroad the first publicly owned line in the nation. The Service hid this fact from President Howard Taft when they applied for the Arrowrock dam’s approval. Fortunately for Reclamation, Taft failed to recognize the loophole and in June 1910, entire project went forward. Yet when the Oregon Shortline refused to honor the pact between Barberton and Reclamation, the Arrowrock & Boise terminal was reduced to a field just outside the Barber lumberyard. On August 22, 1910, the entire deal was finalized and work began on the line to the Arrowrock site. [...] Salt Lake City’s Manly Brothers won the contract for grading the Arrowrock & Boise road in May, 1911. The government called for <b>force</b> <b>account</b> to lay the track from Barber to the work site. Although the construction was delayed several times by the shortage of railroad ties, workers finished the track in early November. By most accounts, the trip through the canyon was a very long and harrowing event. For the first several months, riders were asked to disembark at the unfinished Gooseneck bridge while the cars were winched across one at a time. Yet once they arrived, most passengers were surprised by what they found. Not only was the view breathtaking but the [...] "work" [...] camp offered amenities that were unavailable to some residents of the Treasure Valley. Not only was the site fully powered, but it also provided a central heating plant, running water and an efficient sewage system. Along with the Reclamation offices, the Arrowrock camp carried a hospital, mess hall, post office, and hotel. Workers and visitors were offered lodging in the site’s hotel, bunkhouses or cottages. In addition to the outdoor recreational activities, the camp also operated a YMCA., school, and dancehall. At the peak of construction, some 1,400 people had called Arrowrock home, including some 200 families.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{international}} {{trends in}} the reform of road management, point {{to the need to}} transform <b>force</b> <b>account</b> road maintenance services. With <b>Force</b> <b>Account,</b> funding tends to be erratic; management of equipment and its support facilities inadequate, planning, supervision and execution require high standards of staffing, quality control may be poor; and reporting systems weak. Contracted works have the advantages that payment of work is done to specification, rates are known making budgeting and planning easier, risk is transferred from the Public Sector to the Private Sector, and the profit motive tends to promote efficiency and reduce unnecessary waste.

40|$|Abstract What are {{we doing}} when we make {{inference}}s? I argue that to make an inference is to attach inferential force to an argument. Inferential force must be understood in analogy to assertoric force, and an argument is a structure of contents. I call this the “Force Account of inference. ” I develop this account by first establishing two criteria of adequacy for accounts of inference. First, such accounts must explain why it is absurd to make an inference one believes to be bad. The upshot is that if someone makes an inference, she must take her inference to be good. Second, accounts of inference must explain why we cannot take our inferences to be good [...] -in the sense that matters for inference [...] -by merely accepting testimony {{to the effect that}} they are good. Next, I spell out the <b>Force</b> <b>Account</b> in detail, and I show that it meets these two criteria of adequacy. According to the <b>Force</b> <b>Account,</b> we make an inference by reflectively endorsing the inference as good. That allows us to understand in what sense inference is a self-conscious and active manifestation of reason. I then demonstrate that the account can be fruitfully applied to debates in epistemology and practical philosophy. In particular, I show that the <b>Force</b> <b>Account</b> gives us the resources to settle debates about inferential internalism and pure moral testimony...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{options for}} {{creating}} an enabling {{environment for the}} construction industry, thus leading to more involvement of private contractors and consultants in improved management of road assets. The process, which is of particular importance for economies in transition, begins with separating the functions of planning and management from implementation of road works. Forms of contract reviewed include price based and cost based, procedural to functional specifications (or method based and performance based), and short and long term. These different forms have several implications on the risk allocation between client and contractor; the risks to the highway agency tend to decrease as the agency shifts from <b>force</b> <b>account</b> (or direct labor) to short-and long-term forms of contract with the private sector, including concessions.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the recent decline of union density in Japan from 35 % in 1975 to 28 % in 1987. The decline in density is analyzed {{in terms of the}} changing proportion of workers in high and low unionization groups and the changes in density within those groups. Then using a stockflow relationship we look at how the organizing rate of new unions affects the overall density. A regression model assesses our interpretation of changes in Japanese density. Our principal findings are: (1) Structural shifts in the composition of employment and of the demographics of the work <b>force</b> <b>account</b> for only a modest proportion of the drop in Japanese density. As in the United States, most changes in density occur within industries and among defined demographic groups of workers. (2) Much of the decline in density is associated with the inability of Japanese unions to organize new establishments. We attribute this in part to lowered worker interest and stiffened management opposition to unionism following the oil shock, buttressed by unfavorable changes in the political and legal environment for collective bargaining and for union organization. and by other management actions, such as creating additional pseudomanagerial posts for older male workers. ...|$|E

This paper presents the multiple accounts model, designed by us, which depicts regional transition processes in all employment offices in matrix form, and can therefore also {{be interpreted as a}} regionalised population and labour <b>force</b> <b>account.</b> For the data basis, official individual data about employees, the unemployed and participants in employment and training schemes are combined with aggregate data containing information about school pupils, the self-employed and the retired. In order to estimate missing transition information, the new algorithm ADETON is used, which has the advantage over other entropy optimisation methods that it is also possible to work with inexact boundary conditions. The advantages and possible applications of the multiple accounts model are shown using three examples. The general aims of the multiple accounts model are to record the dynamics of the local labour market, to facilitate comparisons between the regions and to create a basis for the future strategic orientation of active labour market policy. On the one hand it is an instrument that can be used flexibly for scientific analyses of regional labour markets in Germany, {{and on the other hand}} it can be used by the respective employment offices for diverse questions.
