5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

25|$|Harris was {{replaced}} by Howard S. McDonald, who had received a doctorate from the University of California. McDonald was used to an organization which placed the president {{at the head of}} decision-making, rather than a Board of Trustees. Because of this, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble working with the Board, who at BYU had more power than he was accustomed to. However, he achieved several valuable things in his four-year tenure. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, and rebuilt it to house some of the students. McDonald also did several other things. When asked by church leaders whether support for the college be dropped, he answered an adamant no, putting an end to the last real question of the school's survival. He also began a significant building program which was continued by his successors. McDonald resigned in 1949 in order to work at a Los Angeles College fitting his administrative style better.|$|E
500|$|In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of {{the past}} coaches' difficulties: [...] "A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach but that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bad apples. Lester {{was a high school}} coach and nobody had ever heard of him. I can't {{understand}} it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester. Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So much of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd like you to keep closer to the programmed drums,' but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "No Angel" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album. On November 24, 2014 it was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. @lilinternet served as the director and Ed Burke was the creative director for the visual filmed in Houston, Texas. After seeing the music video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Diplo which was directed by @lilinternet and featured various shots of New Orleans, Beyoncé expressed her wish to collaborate with him on the visual for [...] "No Angel". Diplo contacted the director, telling him that the singer is interested in a collaboration. Following discussions with Beyoncé's team, he went to Houston with Ben Solomon and visited her team from Parkwood Entertainment to discuss about his work. In an interview with Vice magazine, @lilinternet recalled that the whole project occurred [...] "very rapidly". Beyoncé told the director she wanted to create a tribute to Houston, as he specialized in working on filming various locations and [...] "environmental beauty". Initially, the video was planned to be shot in a span of eight days. Only little narratives were planned; however @lilinternet revealed that the team opted for driving around Houston and filming various locations and people. He stated, [...] "We had so many Houston legends all together in that video, and they all really worked hard to let us capture Houston properly. Beyonce's team hooked us up with the legends. It's her hometown and she wanted its heroes represented. And I think they really respected the fact we weren't in and out." [...] He added that the video was completed without any [...] "exaggeration" [...] and felt that there was [...] "so much beauty that kind of just innately was in the people and in the city". The director revealed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> freedom while working on the video and added, ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of the band's next album (and first for Fontana) was beset with problems. The band members were distracted by hedonism, ego and indecision, going through four different producers and multiple studios. The stress of Fontana's commercial expectations were also playing a part. In 2005, Chadwick recollected that [...] "the guy who signed us (Dave Bates) had signed Def Leppard and Tears for Fears so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> clout. He insisted on putting us together with producers who were quite obviously wrong for us. He was completely uninterested in anything that didn't {{have a huge}} chorus in it. He wanted hits, basically. He also ordered a load of remixes that we hadn't authorised and we absolutely loathed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Araki said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> readers {{asking him}} to bring older {{characters}} back. Although {{he is not a}} fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author thought of having Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up [...] "playing it by ear" [...] as serialization continued. He gave him the role of [...] "navigator", introducing the readers to the Joestar family, Dio, Hamon and Stands, and his own Stand being a support ability rather than offensive. Stands being a succession of the Hamon and Hamon being life energy that spreads across the body through breathing, Araki thought Joseph's Hermit Purple vines wrapping around his body were a visual representation of that.|$|E

On March 20, she became the third person to be fired. Taylor had been the project manager for her team's third task, and when they lost, she humbly took accountability for their defeat, and did not even choose two people to come {{with her to the}} boardroom, wishing to not instigate any conflict within her team. Donald Trump commented how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> respect for Taylor {{to take responsibility for the}} loss, but he still fired her.

[...] "Some of them weren't really a good fit, as I found out during the process, and by the end I kind of realised that I needed someone to help me along the way. So, it made sense to ask Brian as he's a great friend of mine that also lives in Los Angeles and he has a great studio with lots of resources. He helped oversee the production of the record and made sure that everything was done on time and nothing was missed out during recording and it worked out just perfect", she said. It was easy for her to work with Foote who, understanding that she was a [...] "control freak", tried to [...] "step away a lot". Yet, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> [...] "great suggestions about how to change little things to make them more effective", according to Danilova, and also let her use his [...] "amazing synth collection" [...] which helped the songs grow.|$|E
2500|$|Walt Simonson {{took over}} both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). His stories placed a greater {{emphasis}} on the character's mythological origins. [...] Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson's run, which introduced the character Beta Ray Bill, was regarded as a popular and critical success. Simonson's later stories were drawn by Sal Buscema, who describes Simonson's stories as [...] "very stimulating. It was a pleasure working on his plots, because they were {{a lot of fun to}} illustrate. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> great ideas, and he took Thor in a totally new direction." [...] Asked why he was leaving Thor, Simonson said that he felt the series was due for a change in creative direction, and that he wanted to reduce his work load for a time. After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, Tom DeFalco, became the writer. Working primarily with artist Ron Frenz, DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).|$|E

In promotion for In Death Reborn, Vinnie Paz released The Flawless Victory mixtape on March 2, 2014. Reef the Lost Cauze released a collaboration album titled Fast Way alongside producer Emyd on March 9, 2014. Member Doap Nixon only appeared on the song 7th Ghost from the album, however, {{he went on to say}} how he was only featured on one song because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> personal stuff going on and he is currently working on his fourth studio album Sour Diesel 2, he stated that there will be more of him on the LP that is due to drop in November. King Syze released his fourth studio album a month before the album release on March 25 titled Union Terminology, where he speaks out about working as a union trader. Apathy pushed back the release date of his upcoming album Connecticut Casual from April to June in favour of In Death Reborn.

2500|$|Lucas's {{decision}} to cast [...] "unknowns" [...] was not taken favorably {{by his friend}} Francis Ford Coppola and the studio. Lucas needed an established actor to play the important Obi-Wan Kenobi character. Producer Gary Kurtz said, [...] "The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which meant we needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part." [...] Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (who starred in Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress) was considered for the role. According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas' offers for Kenobi and Darth Vader because [...] "he was concerned about how the film would look {{and that it would}} cheapen the image of samurai... At the time, sci-fi movies still looked quite cheap as the effects were not advanced and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> samurai pride." [...] Guinness {{was one of the few}} cast members who believed that the film would be successful; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the one-fifth gross royalties paid to George Lucas, which made him quite wealthy in later life. He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film. Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming. Harrison Ford said, [...] "It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness. He was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to the other actors. He had a very clear head about how to serve the story." ...|$|E
