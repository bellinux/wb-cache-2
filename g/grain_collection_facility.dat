The withdrawal of government-funded <b>grain</b> <b>collection</b> and distribution <b>facilities</b> {{as part of}} neoliberal reforms in the 1990s and the recent (1998-2008) economic woes of the country led to the decline of these centers. However, some, like Neshuro, have continued to grow, with water and poor roads the major deterrents to investment.|$|R

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1946 there was a famine in the provinces of Rostov, Voronezh, Orel, Kursk and Tambov which was made worse by a poor harvest caused by drought and {{excessively}} high <b>grain</b> <b>collection</b> targets. Those were based on quotas set on too high production expectations which Stalin was unwilling to reduce in many areas. This was also a repetition of the too high quotas and excessive <b>grain</b> <b>collections</b> {{which led to the}} 1932-33 Holodomor famine-genocide which is recognized as having been a deliberate policy.

40|$|While biomass {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important renewable energy source which has a range of positive impacts on the economy, environment, and society, the existence of feedstock seasonality and risk of service disruptions at <b>collection</b> <b>facilities</b> potentially compromises the efficiency and reliability of the energy supply system. In this paper, we consider reliable supply chain design for biomass collection against feedstock seasonality and time-varying disruption risks. We optimize facility location, inventory, biomass quantity, and shipment decisions in a multi-period planning horizon setting. A real-world case in Hubei, China is studied to offer managerial insights. Our computational results show that: (1) the disruption risk significantly affects both the optimal facility locations and the supply chain cost; (2) {{no matter how the}} failure probability changes, setting backup facilities can significantly decrease the total cost; and (3) the feedstock seasonality does not affect locations of the <b>collection</b> <b>facilities,</b> but it affects the allocations of <b>collection</b> <b>facilities</b> and brings higher inventory cost for the biomass supply chain...|$|R
