40|$|Bleeding {{represents}} {{the most feared}} complication of the new oral anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), {{as well as all}} the antithrombotic therapies. During the acute phase of bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants, restoration of an effective hemostasis {{represents the}} cornerstone of practical management. While vitamin K antagonists are effectively and promptly reversed by specific antidotes such as prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K, it is still not clear how to manage the urgent reversal of DOACs during life-threatening or major bleedings {{due to the lack of}} specific antidotes. However, in vitro and ex vivo studies have suggested some potential strategies to reverse DOACs in clinical practice, other than <b>general</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that are always recommended. Activated charcoal could be used in subjects with DOAC-related bleedings presenting to the emergency department within two hours of the last oral intake. Non-activated or activated PCCs (FEIBA) and recombinant activated Factor VII (raFVII) seem to be the optimal strategy for urgent reversal of dabigatran, while non-activated PCCs seem to have efficacy in reversing rivaroxaban. Due to its low plasma protein binding, dabigatran could be also dialyzed in urgent cases. Clinically relevant non-major bleedings and minor bleedings should be treated with general and local measures, respectively, and, when necessary, with dose delay or drug withdrawal. In this article, the Authors describe the practical approach to bleedings occurring during DOACs treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Private {{financing}} of road projects {{in developing countries}} has considerably declined in recent years. Currency crisis have led several projects to fail and increase risk levels of potential projects. For attracting private investments in risky projects, governments have offered incentives and <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Government must assure themselves and convince the <b>general</b> public that <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> given are not excessive. This could be possible by using a transparent, open and quantitative method for evaluating/assessing the risks. This paper reviews methods and techniques used for assessing the risk in private finance projects. A value-for-money (VFM) methodology used in the UK is presented. It was identified that the main shortcoming of the VFM method is surprisingly the lack of transparency towards the general public. This paper indicates some considerations before {{taking into account the}} application of the VFM method in developing countries, and proposes a VFM risk assessment methodological approach for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|Social {{support is}} a {{valuable}} resource for coping with stress, but many do not benefit from the receipt of supportive behaviors. Characteristics of the individual may cause variations in reactions to support. The purpose of this project was to examine how individual characteristics such as neuroticism, extraversion, and <b>general</b> <b>support</b> expectations can influence the evaluation of social support {{and the degree to}} which attributions mediate this effect. It was hypothesized that these individual difference variables would influence attributions for support which would subsequently influence the evaluation of supportive behaviors;This project utilized an experimental design in which participants were provided information that guided them toward support enhancing or support diminishing attributions. This permitted a test of whether prior findings on attributions and the evaluation of social support were truly causal or a function of a third variable. Furthermore, this design allowed a test of whether individual differences in personality and expectations influence the information people use to make attributions. Finally, by examining both traits and expectations in the same study, this project permitted a test of the causal relationship among these variables;The findings partially supported the major hypotheses. The attribution manipulation procedure influenced the evaluation of support, suggesting that attributions have a causal influence on perceptions of support. Participants high in neuroticism who were given negative information about their partner 2 ̆ 7 s behavior evaluated the support they received more harshly than participants low in neuroticism, suggesting that neuroticism is associated with the greater utilization of negative information in making attributions. However, this effect was not found for extraversion or the <b>general</b> <b>support</b> expectation <b>measures.</b> Also, the results suggested that the influence of traits on attributions for support were mediated by expectations.

40|$|Abstract Let μ be {{a finite}} {{positive}} measure on the closed disk D¯ {{in the complex}} plane, let 1 ≤ t < ∞, and let Pt(μ) denote {{the closure of the}} analytic polynomials in Lt(μ). We suppose that D is the set of analytic bounded point evaluations for Pt(μ), and that Pt(μ) contains no nontrivial characteristic functions. It is then known that the restriction of μ to ∂D must be of the form h|dz|. We prove that every function f ∈ Pt(μ) has nontangential limits at h|dz|-almost every point of ∂D, and the resulting boundary function agrees with f as an element of Lt(h|dz|). Our proof combines methods from James E. Thomson’s proof of the existence of bounded point evaluations for Pt(μ) whenever Pt(μ) ≠Lt(μ) with Xavier Tolsa’s remarkable recent results on analytic capacity. These methods allow us to refine Thomson’s results somewhat. In fact, for a <b>general</b> compactly <b>supported</b> <b>measure</b> ν in the complex plane we are able to describe locations of bounded point evaluations for Pt(ν) in terms of the Cauchy transform of an annihilating measure. As a consequence of our result we answer in the affirmative a conjecture of Conway and Yang. We show that for 1 < t < ∞ dim ℳ∕zℳ = 1 for every nonzero invariant subspace ℳ of Pt(μ) if and only if h≠ 0. We also investigate the boundary behaviour of the functions in Pt(μ) near the points z ∈ ∂D where h(z) = 0. In particular, for 1 < t < ∞ we show that there are interpolating sequences for Pt(μ) that accumulate nontangentially almost everywhere on {z : h(z) = 0 }...|$|R

The stress-buffering hypothesis {{may be a}} useful framework by which to understand social support in smoking cessation interventions. The current study evaluated the interrelations among social support, stress, and smoking cessation in both moderation and mediation models. MethodsParticipants (N= 139) were enrolled in a smoking cessation study at the safety-net hospital in Dallas, Texas. During the week prior to a scheduled quit attempt, <b>general</b> social <b>support</b> was <b>measured</b> using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) questionnaire and smoking-specific social <b>support</b> was <b>measured</b> via repeated smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Post-quit stress was repeatedly assessed via smartphone. Logistic regression analyses evaluated potential interaction effects of pre-quit social support and post-quit stress on the likelihood of achieving biochemically-verified 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit. Mediation models were evaluated to determine if post-quit stress mediated the association between pre-quit social support and smoking cessation. ResultsParticipants were predominantly Black (63. 3 %) and female (57. 6 %); and 55 % reported an annual household income of <$ 12, 000. Analyses indicated that pre-quit social support did not significantly interact with post-quit stress to influence smoking cessation. However, post-quit stress did mediate associations between social support variables and smoking cessation. ConclusionsFindings indicated that social support impacts smoking cessation through its influence on post-quit stress among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults participating in cessation treatment. Increasing social support for the specific purpose of reducing stress during a quit attempt may improve smoking cessation rates in disadvantaged populations...|$|R

The authors further propose that different forms of support may predict career agency and occupational engagement, which are important career decision precedents. In addition, we consider the role of personality traits and perceptions (decision-making window) on these two outcomes. Using an online survey sample (N = 281), we found that <b>general</b> career <b>support</b> was important for career agency and occupational engagement. However, it was the combination of higher <b>general</b> career <b>support</b> with either emotional/instrumental support or informational support that was found to lead to both greater career agency and higher occupational engagement.

40|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} of graph databases has grown rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, {{there are two main}} problems: <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for both measures and bounding theorems for all presented <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> in the hypergraph setting. We further show that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> can be defined and profiled in it...|$|R
