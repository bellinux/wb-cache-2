Melua said in a statement: [...] "This album {{was going to be}} my 'singer's album'. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never got to play the songs live. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is {{what this is all}} about. [...] I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E
500|$|The book Conversations with Woody Allen {{reports that}} {{director}} Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005, {{but was unable}} to do so because he could not get insurance on them, stating, [...] "We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [...] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent." ...|$|E

"Of course <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{intended}} {{to go into}} a profession. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never looked at it in the same light as you do. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{intended to}} make my own way, and have no doubt that I shall do so. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quite made up my mind about it now." ...|$|R
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|... "Never Again" [...] {{was written}} by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. The episode was the final episode that Morgan or Wong would write until the tenth season, as they took over as executive producers for the series' sister show Millennium shortly after. The initial story the two developed was a “sort of Abraham Lincoln’s ghost in the White House type of thing”. Both writers had desired {{to write a story}} wherein Lincoln's ghost haunts the White House and Mulder and Scully investigate. Morgan explained that he had [...] "done a lot of research and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to write a feature about Lincoln’s ghost". However, due to the massive amounts of rewrites the two were forced to do for [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", both Morgan and Wong lost interest in the story. Morgan explained, [...] "I felt they didn’t want my heart and soul anymore, so I wouldn’t give this one to them". The two later crafted [...] "Never Again" [...] in its place. Years later, Frank Spotnitz said that he [...] "always wondered about" [...] the story and what the finished product would have been like.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{monument}} to Furuseth outside {{the entrance to the}} Sailors' Union of the Pacific Hall in San Francisco, California. Inscribed on it is the [...] "Furuseth Credo": [...] "You can put me in jail. But you cannot give me narrower quarters than as a seaman <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>had.</b> You cannot give me coarser food than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> eaten. You cannot make me lonelier than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been." [...] The monument was originally placed at the Ferry building during the mayoralty of Angelo Rossi, it was later moved.|$|R

Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again.

2500|$|Simon Hoggart, {{writing in}} The Guardian, related an anecdote of Soames' childhood: [...] "He {{gave me the}} true version of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{suspected}} was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn't know how important his grandfather was until someone told him. So {{he walked up to}} the old man's bedroom, managed to get past the valets and the secretaries, and found him sitting up in bed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his success}} with prose {{literature}} in the Science-in-Fiction genre, Carl Djerassi started to write plays. Theatre, {{even more so than}} prose, seems to fulfill his desire to work in a more “dialogical” environment than the monological natural sciences had allowed him to do. According to British director Andy Jordan, who has produced all of his plays in England, Djerassi’s dramatic works are “not wholly or straightforwardly naturalistic or realistic [...] avowedly text-driven, where ideas, themes, words and language were majorly important, a fact <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> to be conscious of as the director.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976 Ginn {{formed the}} punk rock band Panic. Panic {{recorded}} eight songs in January 1978, but no labels {{were interested in}} releasing the music aside from Los Angeles, California record label Bomp! Records. By late 1978 Bomp had still not formally agreed to release the music on record, so Ginn decided he had enough business experience with SST to release it himself. Pressing records {{turned out to be}} a simple matter; [...] "I just looked in the phone book under record pressing plants and there was one there", Ginn recalled, [...] "and so I just took it to them and I knew about printing because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> done catalogs." [...] SST Records released the music recorded by Ginn's band (now named Black Flag) as the Nervous Breakdown EP in January 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Later this {{affinity}} for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and {{visits to the}} United Kingdom. [...] He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons. [...] He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster) and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury). In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison. [...] In that work, Buechner expresses [...] "the feeling that from the beginning I had had in England that in some sense I had come home, the feeling <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> dreamed.

Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2017 Edmonds said he {{attempted}} suicide after fraud {{by a group}} of HBOS financiers destroyed his Unique Group business: [...] "Until these criminals took me to the brink of emotional annihilation, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly... But having been cast into that bottomless dark space devoid of logic and reason, I have a much deeper understanding of life without hope... I seek no sympathy and feel no shame in admitting that on the evening of January 18th 2005 I attempted to end the overwhelming mental pain which had consumed my whole being." [...] He also blamed HBOS for his prostate cancer, saying, [...] "I am absolutely sure the negative forces acting on me impacted on my health... There is a wealth of information from various clinical studies of a direct link between stress and cancer... I am absolutely certain there was a link in my case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all I had to do was say yes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to carry a movie.
