5000|$|Workers {{were active}} {{investing}} in {{the first wave of}} expansion of the limiteds between 1870 and 1873, and the wave of 1873-75. Many of the new companies were conversions of failing private concerns. When the boom ended a hundred companies had been created. An average worker could earn about £1.75 a week (35 shillings). A share could be bought for £5.00. Workers would buy shares in their own company and maybe another mill to balance the risk. Companies' capital consisted of loan finance as well as equity subscriptions, generally in equal proportions. Workers were virtually guaranteed to earn more in dividend (always over 5%) than in a saving bank. Share were trader over tables in local public houses and Oldham had its own stock exchange. It was in the workers interest to ensure that the mill was profitable so they received the largest dividend. When in 1875, there was a change in conditions of service of textile workers from the pay scale called the 1872 Oldham list, to the 1875 Oldham list the transition went smoothly, as the dividend was an important <b>incentive.</b> <b>Wage</b> rates climbed and costs were recouped by using inferior cotton.

The larger the dispersion of wage increases the higher the amount of monetary incentives in firms. In contrast, huge wage inequality without any promotion possibilities does not induce any monetary incentives. Evidence from unique Danish linked employer employee data shows that large dispersion of wage growth within firms is generally connected with low firm performance.

In places that receive {{a disproportionate share of}} the elderly, such as areas in Florida, Arizona, and California, migration can have magnified effects on the economic base, housing market, infrastructure needs, and social service delivery systems in the region. Local governments typically face the task of anticipating these effects, but are handicap~ by a lack of understanding of the migration of elderly people. In this paper the determinants of such migration are analyzed with special reference to how cost of living influences the selection of a destination by migrating elderly persons (55 and over) during 1975 - 1980.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of judicial corruption and incorporates it into Polinsky, A. M. (1980). Strict liability vs. negligence in a market setting. American Economic Review, 70, 363 – 367 framework so as to analyze {{the efficiency of the}} negligence rule. By shedding light on the role of social norms in regard to {{the phenomenon of}} judicial corruption, this analysis provides implications for policy. First, more prevalent corruption at the status quo tends to intensify the extent of the corruption itself and, as a result, the effectiveness of the government’s corruption enforcement is greatly lessened. This implies that an excessively lenient policy of corruption may result in an uncontrollable consequence; once corruption becomes rampant, it is costly to bring it down. Of great importance, in the presence of such a corruption effect, the social optimum cannot be achieved based on the negligence rule and the equivalence between the strict liability and negligence rule fails. Secondly, the attitude of the society toward a corrupt judge plays a crucial role in governing the effectiveness of an efficient wage arrangement. If the society can fully accept a corrupt judge, corruption will never be controlled even with the <b>incentive</b> <b>wage</b> scheme.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to make the}} {{characteristics}} of the wage administration in postwar Japan clear, comparing to the characteristics in the prewar. Its contents are as follows: (1) the concepts and structure of the wage administration, (2) the characteristics of the wage in Japanese business, (3) the characteristics of personnel administration in postwar Japan, (4) conclusion - the characteristics of the wage administration in postwar Japan. The writer think that the wage administration's characteristics are determined mainly by the wage determination's system and the degrees of the personnel administration's development. And therefore this essay describes the characteristics of the wage and personnel administration in Japanese business in the previous parts. In Japan there has not ever been general wage-rate, but the wages are determined in extent of each enterprise's ability to pay. In this result, a. sum of wage for each employee is determined in accordance with the individual living conditions of him. And also, the, development of work-standardization is so imperfect that the scientific <b>incentive</b> <b>wage</b> does not develop sufficiently. Concerning to the personnel administration in the postwar, it has been ever tinged with the paternalistic features as same as in the prewar, but however some of the personnel management plans, for example merit rating, training for supervisors and job evaluation's methods, become to take modern methods. Such features has influence upon the wage administration. In this way, the wage administration in the postwar proceeds to have the prewar characteristics, while it begins to have some modern features; in other words, it may say what the wage administration has two characters is the principal characteristic in the postwar...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years income {{inequality}} in the U. S. has increased considerably. Partly because of this, {{there has been}} a surge in economics research devoted to understanding the causes and consequences of income and wage inequality. Most of the research, however, assesses individual preferences over inequality, rather than how the presence of inequality shapes behavior. This dissertation adds to the small but growing literature which analyzes the behavioral impacts of income inequality. ^ In particular, this dissertation tests the effects of firm, occupation, and community wage inequality on worker effort, work hours, and job satisfaction. Chapter 1 uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics linked to the Current Population Survey to investigate the impact of occupation and community inequality on individual weekly work hours. One of the primary limitations of chapter 1 is the inability to measure the correlation between effort and work hours and the inability to address demand constraints faced by workers. Chapter 2 uses a cross-section dataset, the 2004 wave of the Workplace Employee Relations Survey, to investigate these two issues. Both chapters test the claim put forth by others that wage inequality and work hours are positively correlated because of the <b>incentive</b> <b>wage</b> inequality generates to get a promotion. It is found, contrary to the existing literature, that there is at best a small negative correlation between inequality and work hours, and most likely no causal relationship at all. ^ Chapter 3 further investigates the effects of wage inequality on worker effort hinted at in chapter 2. The primary goal of this chapter is to investigate any mitigating influences on the seemingly robust finding that effort and the expected return to promotion are positively correlated. There are two important findings. First, the positive correlation between the return to promotion and effort is very sensitive to how the return to promotion is measured. Second, the amount of control a worker has over her job and workplace significantly reduces the power of wage inequality for motivating worker effort. Taken together, the dissertation casts doubt on the use of wage inequality and promotion ladders to motivate workers. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} trace {{the way in which}} various methods were used in the payment of wages in Yawata Steel Works from 1900 s to 1930 s. The widely held idea behind the wage payment in the post WW‡U Japanese society has {{required}} companies to pay wages which not only guarantee the amount of money sufficient to lead a family life according to his/her social status but also reflect the ability and performance of each employee. The predecessors of this idea will be found in the personnel practices of companies before the WW‡U. The development of wage system in Yawata Steel Works, along with those implemented in the National Railways and ship-building works, will represent the case which will show how a wage policy which gave employees both the guarantee of standard life style and the incentives for higher efficiency was developed at an enterprise level. By the rule of the Steel Works, all the workers were supposed to receive wages calculated on a fixed daily wage rate which varied among workers corresponding to his experience and skill. This wage system resembled the time wages dominant in U. S. A in that wages were paid for the days workers were engaged in operations, but differed from the American system in that no hourly wage rate was fixed. A day rate fixed for each worker was reviewed occasionally, and in some times managers granted an increase in the rate. The daily wage rate was quite effectual in giving workers the stability of daily life but rather weak in making them work harder. The weakness of the daily wage rate system in giving work incentives became apparent soon after the Works started the system in 1900. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905 created an opportunity for the Works to expand its production. To meet the growing demand, the managers of some rolling mills felt it necessary to use incentive plans to increase production. Under the condition where the maintenance of daily wage rate was mandatory, they had recourse to a method which combined the daily wage rate with premium bonus. Ten years later, another war necessitated the adoption of various kinds of incentives and benefits along with the daily wage rate. After years of implementing incentive plans in various mills, <b>incentive</b> <b>wage</b> system gradually became {{an integral part of the}} wage system of the Works. Some times a group piece rate system with the minimum guarantee of the daily wage rate was implemented, and in other cases the combination of the daily wage rate system and group incentive systems was preferred. In this way, the need to guarantee the standard life and the call for incentives were met in the payment of wages. ...|$|E
