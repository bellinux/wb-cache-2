40|$|The present paper describes, to our {{knowledge}} for the first time, the successful collection and evaluation of semen from the <b>Indian</b> <b>white-backed</b> <b>vulture</b> (Gyps bengalensis), a critically en-dangered bird. Over a period of 2 yr, semen was collected using the manual massage method and evaluated for semen volume, semen pH, sperm concentration, percentage normal/abnormal spermatozoa, and percentage motile spermatozoa. It appears that the concentration of spermatozoa and percentage motile spermatozoa in the Indian white-backed vultures are low com-pared to those in other birds. Tyrode medium supplemented with albumin, lactate, and pyruvate (TALP) {{proved to be the}} best se-men extender compared to two others (Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender and Lake diluent). Furthermore, TALP with 20 % egg yolk and supplemented with 8 % dimethyl sulfoxide maintained 50 % of the initial percentage of motile spermatozoa following cryopreservation and thawing. A computer-aided semen analysis indicated that the spermatozoa of the Indian white-backed vul-ture are extremely active and swim in linear trajectories for up to 5 h following dilution in TALP. The trajectories were linear with time, but we noticed a decrease in the velocity parameters (average path velocity, curvilinear velocity, and progressive ve-locity). Thus, the present study provides baseline data on semen characteristics of the highly endangered <b>Indian</b> <b>white-backed</b> <b>vulture,</b> and these data could be of immense importance to re-productive and conservation biologists attempting to breed these animals in captivity, which to date has not been achieved. gamete biology, sperm, sperm motility and transpor...|$|E

To rule out the possibility of viral infections, cloacal, tracheal and serum samples were collected from the vulture. They were negative for Avian Influenza (AI) viruses, Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), Infectious Bursal Disease Virus by virus isolation. We observed neck drooping behavior by vulture when approached by humans. The vulture flew away but after two days, was found dead 60 km away, due to electrocution.

While many wetland birds are flushed by birds of prey, these storks are not usually intimidated and can be quite aggressive to other large water-birds such as herons and cranes. Adults aggressively defend small depressions of deep water against egrets and herons (at Malabanjbanjdju in Kakadu National Park, Australia), and drying wetland patches against waterbirds such as spoonbills and woolly-necked storks (at Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh, India).|$|R

50|$|<b>White-backed</b> <b>vultures</b> are an {{endangered}} species, {{and they need}} all their resources in order to survive. One trait that the vultures have is their vocalization {{when it comes to}} eating. <b>White-backed</b> <b>vultures</b> give out a yell when they are locked onto a target or even when they are eating. These creatures are in great danger though, as they have been slowly disappearing. It does not help their survival rate with a diminishing environment, causing a decrease in the amount of food available, and then the competition for food. The competition affects the vultures in a variety of different ways. First, the <b>white-backed</b> <b>vulture</b> is not a species that shares food with others of its own species. Second, there is the competition that the white-backs face with other animals in their habitat. It is just not what the vultures eat that is a huge part to their diets.|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} status of the African <b>White-backed</b> <b>Vulture</b> Gyps africanus in Kenya, but ongoing studies indicate that its population has declined over the last two decades. A total of 32 African <b>White-backed</b> <b>Vulture</b> nests were monitored in the Masai Mara National Reserve over a five-year period between 2003 and 2007. Mean nesting success was 59 %, which is comparable to that of populations from southern Africa. Nearest neighbour distances were significantly closer in wooded habitats (‘trees and shrubs savanna’) than in more open grassland habitats (‘open low shrubs’). Based on nearest neighbour distances, the estimated total breeding population within the Masai Mara National Reserve is 1 106 pairs, a figure that may be an overestimate and requires ground-truthing. Collecting baseline data on numbers of breeding pairs and regular nest monitoring are essential in order {{to assess the impact of}} various threats to vultures in Kenya, which include growing threats (elephant-mediated habitat disturbance and fire) as well as emerging threats (such as poisoning with the carbamate-based pesticide Furadan™).

40|$|Background: Populations of the Oriental <b>White-backed</b> <b>Vulture</b> (Gyps bengalensis) have {{declined}} by over 95 % {{within the past}} decade. This decline {{is largely due to}} incidental consumption of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory veterinary pharmaceutical diclofenac, commonly used to treat domestic livestock. The conservation status of other Gyps vultures in southern Asia is also of immediate concern, given the lack of knowledge regarding status of their populations and the continuing existence of taxonomic uncertainties. In this study, we assess phylogenetic relationships for all recognized species and the majority of subspecies within the genus Gyps. The continuing veterinary use of diclofenac is an unknown but potential risk to related species with similar feeding habits to Gyps bengalensis. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the phylogenetic relationships among Gyps vultures should aid in their conservation by clarifying taxonomic uncertainties, and enabling inference of their respective relatedness to susceptible G. bengalensis. Results: Phylogenetic results using mitochondrial cytB, ND 2 and control region sequence data indicate a recent and rapid diversification within the genus Gyps. All recognized species formed monophyletic groups with high statistical support, {{with the exception of the}} Eurasian Vulture, for which specimens identified as subspecies G. fulvus fulvescens appear closely related to the Himalayan Vulture (G. himalayensis). In all analyses, the earliest divergence separated the Oriental <b>White-backed</b> <b>Vulture</b> from other Gyps taxa, with the next diverging taxon being either the African <b>White-backed</b> <b>Vulture</b> (G. africanus), or the Himalaya...|$|R

In 2016, Asia's first ever release of vultures program commenced on the World Environment Day, {{with the release of}} two Himalayan Griffons, that were released with the wing tags (brightly coloured plastic tags for the field observation through binoculars) and ring tags (pbrightly coloured lastic tags with conspicuous letters and numbers markings used by the filed biologists to identify individual birds without recapture) but without the satellite-based tracking device. These two vultures were brought in 2005 to lay eggs for breeding, were eventually released in the wild in 2016, but could not be tracked {{due to the lack of}} satellite tracker.

40|$|Like {{many large}} raptors, {{vultures}} are intolerant of humans, making them difficult to study; consequently their ecology {{is not well}} understood. New technologies such as satellite tracking, and more powerful statistical analysis {{have the potential to}} reveal more about these birds. <b>White-backed</b> <b>vultures</b> display an aversion to nesting in proximity to humans, and, in areas with high human population densities, are restricted to nesting in nature reserves and private game farms; lappet-faced vultures display even less tolerance to human presence. Cape vultures, fitted with satellite tracking devices, showed a preference for foraging close to their nest or roost, but avoided areas of human settlement when foraging. <b>White-backed</b> <b>vultures</b> appear adaptable in their choice of nest site and can nest at high densities; they appear able to survive in small protected areas, but this is not true of other species. Habitat associations of vultures were not general across regions. Breeding success of vultures and marabou storks is apparently related to food availability. In the case of <b>white-backed</b> <b>vultures</b> nest success was also negatively affected by nesting density, but density did not affect the colonially nesting marabou or territorial lappet-faced vulture. Immature birds are capable of moving large distances after fledging: movements of over 1000 km from the nest site were recorded by cape vultures and marabous. These results have implications for the continued survival of these species; their differing abilities to adapt to human presence will most likely affect those chances of survival.
