Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E

500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found my savior." [...] She {{went on to say}} that it was her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church– / I keep it, staying at Home".|$|E

On April 2, [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] was {{released}} as a single and released to radio a week later. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 {{it was announced that}} O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It was getting to the point where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E

In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E
500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene. As the {{popularity}} of 80's pop gave way to alternative rock, Yankovic {{decided it was time}} to record a parody of the Seattle-based band's huge hit single [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic later said, [...] "I wanted to make sure that when I came back after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn't until Nirvana that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a real contender." [...] To secure permission for the parody, Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain. After learning that Nirvana was to perform on Saturday Night Live, Yankovic called up his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, who was, at the time, a regular cast member on the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was [...] "going to be a song about food". [...] Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how [...] "no one can understand [...] lyrics" [...] to the original, which Cobain thought was funny. After receiving permission, Yankovic wrote and recorded [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] on January 27, 1992.|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E

500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Producers Lindelof and Cuse were {{initially}} {{worried about how}} the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in [...] "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, {{as well as the}} other new characters from the freighter, as [...] "great" [...] and [...] "exciting", writing that: [...] "Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters [...] "fascinating" [...] and wrote that they [...] "totally worked for me, while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more." [...] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback [...] "mind-bending", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] the [...] "perfect introduction" [...] to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out more about them. Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they [...] "fit seamlessly into the ensemble", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed [...] "a real cult figure." [...] In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because [...] "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a true handle on what they were like as individuals."

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective.
