500|$|Gingrich {{received}} deferments {{from the}} military {{during the years of}} the Vietnam War for being a student and a father. [...] In 1985, he stated, [...] "Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> over." ...|$|E
500|$|By summer 1968, {{the group}} had become {{concerned}} about O'List's reliability and matters {{came to a head}} following a gig in Croydon's Fairfield Hall in September. According to Ward, O'List had an altercation with him in mid-performance. Emerson subsequently called a band meeting with Jackson and Davison and stated flatly that O'List should be sacked. They agreed, and immediately after their performance at The Ritz, Bournemouth in October, he was fired by Stratton-Smith {{with the rest of the}} band present. O'List, however, claims that he left the band voluntarily because he was upset at Stratton-Smith's decision to make Emerson the front man, saying [...] "I left the band and waited for Keith to get in contact... <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> straight to Keith, but I didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Udell {{recorded}} that on August 1, the Rose company ventured west {{without the}} Baley company, who waited one full day before starting out from Leroux Springs. In the meantime, the search party had located enough springs to sustain {{them for the}} next [...] Several days later, the party reached their last known source of water, and Savedra informed them {{that there was not}} another for [...] Because that was too long for their animals to travel without water, the party decided to backtrack approximately [...] to the location of the last reliable supply at Cataract Creek. Udell again protested to no avail, recording in his journal that night: [...] "Had there been a road that I could have traveled without a guide, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on and risked the consequences." [...] Having trekked [...] without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called [...] "wigglers"; however, they {{had no choice but to}} drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building casks out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, [...] "Our water still holds out... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>gone</b> crazy at fust, but I {{went off}} into the office without a word. Some men would ha' knocked 'im down for it, but I made {{allowances}} for 'is state o' mind, and I stayed inside until I see 'im get aboard agin.|$|R
60|$|If I had {{had ample}} time for consideration, <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> still <b>have</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>Having</b> hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing {{me that the}} coach started within half an hour,--I {{resolved}} to <b>go.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> certainly not <b>have</b> <b>gone,</b> but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That, coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned the scale.|$|R
2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone.</b> I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't think I would have learned much more, and I don't think I would have had the nerve to tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E
2500|$|Bezabeh's {{attempt to}} raise an army against Menelik failed; {{thousands}} of Shewans rallied {{to the flag}} of the son of Negus Haile Melekot and even Bezabeh's own soldiers deserted him for the returning prince. Abeto Menelik entered Ankober and proclaimed himself Negus. While Negus Menelik reclaimed his ancestral Shewan crown, he also laid claim to the Imperial throne, as a direct descendant male line of Emperor Lebna Dengel. However, he made no overt attempt to assert this claim at this time; Marcus interprets his lack of decisive action not only to Menelik's lack of confidence and experience, but that [...] "he was emotionally incapable of helping to destroy the man who had treated him as a son." [...] Not wishing {{to take part in the}} 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, he allowed his rival Kassai to benefit with gifts of modern weapons and supplies from the British. When Tewodros committed suicide, Menelik arranged for an official celebration of his death even though he was personally saddened by the loss. When the British asked him why he did this, he replied [...] "to satisfy the passions of the people ... as for me, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into a forest to weep over ... untimely death ... I have now lost the one who educated me, and toward whom I had always cherished filial and sincere affection." [...] Afterwards other challenges – a revolt amongst the Wollo to the north, the intrigues of his second wife Befana to replace him with her choice of ruler, military failures against the Arsi Oromo to the south east – kept Menelik from directly confronting Kassai until after his rival had brought an Abuna from Egypt who crowned him Emperor Yohannes IV.|$|E

6000|$|After {{waiting for}} a moment to receive some {{assurance}} to the contrary, and not receiving any, Mr. Guppy proceeds, [...] "If it had been Jarndyce and Jarndyce, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> at once to your ladyship's solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, of the Fields. I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn--at least we move when we meet one another--and if it had been any business of that sort, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are," [...] said Robarts, {{who knew the}} man well, and cared nothing for his friend's peculiarities when he felt his own withers to be unwrung. [...] "But {{you might have been}} down at Hoggle End with the brickmakers, and then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to <b>go</b> after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; {{and then}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>go</b> again with you. But, John, really I don't wish to walk to-day." [...] Whereupon John Eames again {{put down his}} hat.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{would make}} but little difference. But {{nevertheless}} I will not go. Had I known this before <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> there. It was to testify my belief in your innocence; nay, my conviction--" ...|$|R
