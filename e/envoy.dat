5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{pressure}} from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine <b>envoy</b> Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay {{the release of the}} captives until after the campaign against the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the diffusion of}} market orientation (MO) as a social learning process to acquire and transfer individual-level MO. Central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or <b>envoys.</b> Through their marketoriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups—formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. In turn, these observers become top managers’ <b>envoys</b> and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. Empirical results from a three-level data set from a Fortune 500 company support this perspective. While <b>envoys</b> who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, <b>envoys</b> who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. Network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. By identifying who the important work-group <b>envoys</b> are and under what conditions certain <b>envoys</b> {{are likely to be}} most effective, this study helps managers select the best <b>envoys</b> to implement MO...|$|R

The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an <b>envoy</b> he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures. The returning <b>envoy</b> reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an <b>envoy</b> to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The <b>envoy,</b> Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E

Broadly, the Parva recognizes four types of <b>envoys</b> - Samdisțārtha are <b>envoys</b> who convey a message but {{do not have any}} discretion to negotiate; Parimițārtha are <b>envoys</b> who are granted a circumscribed purpose with some flexibility on wording; Nisrșțārtha are <b>envoys</b> with an overall goal and significant discretion to adapt the details of negotiations to the circumstances; finally, Dūtapranidhi, a full ambassador who has full confidence of the party he represents, understands the interests and Dharma (law, morals, duties) of both parties, and can decide the goal as well as style of negotiations (Krishna acts as such an ambassador in Bhagavat-yana sub-parva of Udyoga Parva).|$|R
