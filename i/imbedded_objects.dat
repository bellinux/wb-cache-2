[...] Every step of the process could be followed, from the accidental deposition of a single casting on a small object lying loose on the surface, to its being entangled amidst the matted roots of the turf, and lastly to its being embedded in the mould at various depths beneath the surface. When the same field was re-examined after the interval of a few years, such objects were found at a greater depth than before. The straightness and regularity of the lines formed by the <b>imbedded</b> <b>objects,</b> and their parallelism with the surface of the land, are the most striking features of the case; for this parallelism shows how equably the worms must have worked; the result being, however, partly the effect of the washing down of the fresh castings by rain. The specific gravity of the objects does not affect their rate of sinking, as could be seen by porous cinders, burnt marl, chalk and quartz pebbles, having all sunk to the same depth within the same time. Considering the nature of the substratum, which at Leith Hill Place was sandy soil including many bits of rock, and at Stonehenge, chalk-rubble with broken flints; considering, also, the presence of the turf-covered sloping border of mould round the great fragments of stone at both these places, their sinking does not appear to have been sensibly aided by their weight, though this was considerable. {50} ...|$|E

The multi-sensor capabilities (electro-optical, or visual, and infrared) currently implemented in software have also been applied to non-realtime imaging applications on workstations and minicomputers. Most suited for terrain based applications, the system features haze, <b>imbedded</b> targets, moving <b>objects,</b> smooth shading, and specular reflections...|$|R

The method does not require any a prior information on the physical properties of the scattering object and, under some restrictions, avoids the need to compute the Green’s tensor for the background medium. 1...|$|R
40|$|Profiles of the Br-alpha line of H I at a {{velocity}} {{resolution of}} 45 km/s are presented for the compact <b>imbedded</b> infrared <b>objects</b> BN, S 106 /IRS 3, GLS 490, GL 961, GL 989, Mon. R 2 /IRS 2, {{and for the}} visible objects LkH-alpha 101, T Tau, and R Mon. A proportionality obtained between Br-alpha luminosity and bolometric luminosity is shown to extend over three orders of magnitude, supporting {{the idea that the}} physical conditions and gas motions in the circumstellar envelopes of stellar objects are closely related over a wide range of luminosities. The Br-alpha line strengths are compared to radio continuum flux densities in the context of stellar wind models. Momentum deposition rates deduced from Br-alpha or radio continuum fluxes are consistent with those available in the radiation fields, which appear capable of driving the ionized gas outflows {{in the vicinity of the}} core sources. The results of a comparison of the H-alpha and Br-alpha profiles for T Tau are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} various essays that {{explore the}} encounter of photography with other media since the 1960 s. The essays offer {{new ways of}} thinking about photography beyond modernist notions of medium specificity and autonomy – based upon the idea that photography does not rely on a coherent system of codes but is almost always encountered as a fragmented, partial object. Addressing recent debates in art history and photography theory, film studies, and media theory, the book includes a broad array of approaches, relating photography to issues of the panorama, surveillance, sculpture, transformation and processuality, and the development of new media categories. Rather than conceiving of photography as a medium, the aim is to reconsider photography as a historically, theoretically, and culturally <b>imbedded</b> heterogeneous <b>object</b> that is always related to, in contact with, or shaped by other media.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model for}} interacting objects, where the evolution of each object is given by a finite state Markov chain, whose transition matrix depends on {{the present and the}} past of the distribution of states of all objects. This is a general model of wide applicability; we mention as examples: TCP connections, HTTP flows, robot swarms, reputation systems. We show that when the number of objects is large, the occupancy measure of the system converges to a deterministic dynamical system (the “mean field”) with dimension the number of states of an individual object. We also prove a fast simulation result, which allows to simulate the evolution of a few particular <b>objects</b> <b>imbedded</b> in a large system. We illustrate how this can be used to model the determination of reputation in large populations, with various liar strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|As an artist, my {{methodology}} emulates that of {{a historian}} and enters into the arena of archaeologists, archivists and curators. Historians write, and re-write history privileging certain evidence while imposing specific agendas, to reshape history. Confronting history as a construction; I provoke viewers through a visual historical representation, unmasking illusions of precision and truth. By deconstructing and analyzing the way the historical record is fabricated, my work reveals the futile nature of preserving an accurate history. The contextualization of objects becomes imperative to how this project is perceived. My goal is to redefine the importance of installation and presentation of objects. The objects themselves are important, but become secondary to the structure and organization of the installation. The structural framework challenges viewers to consider the origins {{of knowledge about the}} past and how archaeologists, archivists and curators reinterpret and mythologize historical evidence. Elaborate, curated displays suggest the research and conclusions <b>imbedded</b> in the <b>objects.</b> The arrangement reflects a stratified composite structure, mirroring written narrative history...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{fractional}} gravity for spacetimes with non-integer dimensions. Our constructions {{are based on}} a geometric formalism with the fractional Caputo derivative and integral calculus adapted to nonolonomic distributions. This allows us to define a fractional spacetime geometry with fundamental geometric/physical objects and a generalized tensor calculus all being similar to respective integer dimension constructions. Such models of fractional gravity mimic the Einstein gravity theory and various Lagrange-Finsler and Hamilton-Cartan generalizations in nonholonomic variables. The approach suggests a number of new implications for gravity and matter field theories with singular, stochastic, kinetic, fractal, memory etc processes. We prove that the fractional gravitational field equations can be integrated in very general forms following the anholonomic deformation method for constructing exact solutions. Finally, we study some examples of fractional black hole solutions, fractional ellipsoid gravitational configurations and <b>imbedding</b> of such <b>objects</b> in fractional solitonic backgrounds.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} {{the action of}} the gaze in dialogue. The gaze is an aspect of dialogue that acts as an undercurrent to surface communication. Through its action, the gaze arranges social spaces by ascribing value onto persons, objects, practices and ideas. For the most part it does so unobserved. The social and interpersonal dynamics that the gaze creates are <b>imbedded</b> in art <b>objects</b> and in the processes of art making. Hence, one of the important tasks of the educator is to elicit the countergaze-a moment of insight when the student recognizes the gaze and its action. Just as Velasquez held a mirror to the king and queen by painting Las Meninas, artists, curators and teachers may also invite moments of insight {{that have to do with}} the relational dynamics in a social environment. Perhaps, by holding up the metaphorical mirror, these educators can make the gaze of patrons, visitors and students visible to themselves. Artists, curators and teachers can make contemporary audiences aware of how they, as part of society, ascribe value to persons, things and ideas represented in art and other forms of cultural expression. Art teachers, like artists, may frame situations, events, issues, ideas, and the like, so that persons who gaze are made aware of how they are creating and recreating patterns in social space. Hopefully, with this insight, the social spaces where art is displayed, talked about and created may become places of personal and social transformation...|$|R
40|$|Array camera {{images of}} the central 1 parsec of the Galactic Center at eight {{mid-infrared}} wavelengths between 4. 8 and 20. 0 microns with approximately 1 arcsec resolution are used to model the temperature, opacity and bolometric luminosity distributions of the emitting dust in the central parsec, and the extinction {{in the line of}} sight. We use the results to discriminate between two mechanisms for heating the dust: heating by radiation from a "central engine" (possibly a massive black hole associated with Sgr A*), or internal heating by luminous stars embedded in or among the dust clouds. The temperature and opacity distributions are consistent with the presence of self-luminous <b>objects</b> <b>imbedded</b> at prominent the IRS source positions. However, temperatures on the northern ann and east-west bar are highest along the inner flank of those structures surrounding the central cavity, while the dust opacity peaks further out from the central cavity. The warm inner ridge suggests heating by centrally located concentrated luminous sources, including IRS 3 and IRS 7. The of the model results are compared with the distributions of the various stellar populations in the central parsec. There is evidence for physical interaction between the warm emitting dust and luminous stars, including dozens of hot He 1 emission line stars and B[] stars. The combined contributions of embedded stars at the IRS source positions and the luminous stars distributed throughout Sgr A West can account for the temperature enhancements and the luminosity distribution in the central parsec computed by the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} and their analysis, {{presented in this}} paper, deal with the tracking behaviour of tethered flying flies (Musca domestica) towards moving black objects in front of white or randomly contrasted backgrounds. Experiments were carried out under closed—as well as under open-loop conditions. Under closed-loop the fly is coupled to its environment, whereas under open-loop its motor output does not influence the visual input. The following expeeiments have been carried out: Tracking of a black object {{in front of a}} white background (Section 3. 1); under closed-loop, a fly follows an object, moved at constant angular speed ω, however, lagging behind it by the tracking angle ψtr. ψtr is linearly related to ω. Stable tracking in Musca is confined to about± 20 o both sides of the flight direction. Tracking of a black <b>object,</b> <b>imbedded</b> in a randomly contrasted pattern of different contrast (Section 3. 2) : under these conditions the same tracking rules {{as in the case of}} a white background are observed. With decreasing contrast difference between the object and the random pattern, the steepness of the linear relation between ω and ψtr increases. These observations are consistent with earlier experimental results and can be explained in terms of a phenomenological theory describing visual orientation in Musca; Poggio and Reichardt (1973 a), Reichardt and Poggio (1975). Detection and tracking of a black object, hidden in a random background pattern of the same contrast (Sections 3. 3 and 3. 4) : it is shown that the necessary condition for detection and tracking of an object under these conditions is the presence of relative motion between the object and the background. When the background is moved and the object is stationary, no detection is observed. The effect strongly depends upon parameters such as the object and the background configurations and their contrast differences. Full independence between the nervous correlates induced by the object and the background is also reached when the object is moved with constant angular speed against the background. In this case the phenomenological theory is easily applicable. Detection is demonstrated under closed—as well as under open-loop conditions. Analysis and interpretation of the detection phenomenon requires a mathematical formalism describing the responsible nonlinear interaction processes in the Central Nervous System of the fly. The Volterra description is such a formalism; Poggio and Reichardt (1973 b). In terms of this formalism and in view of more recent experiments by Pick (1974) and by Heimburger et al. (1975), the detection effect can be accounted for by fourth order nonlinear interactions between the signals received from two to four receptors. The latter observations and their interpretations might lead to a better understanding of the discrmination of the optical environment into figure and ground...|$|R
