30|$|The {{findings}} of this paper are {{similar to that of}} the research by Yue (2010) who uses the data from household surveys to analyze the reasonable and unreasonable parts of the salary gap between monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> competition <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> finds the unjustified part of the salary gap between monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> competition <b>industries</b> contributes more than 48 %. In comparison, this thesis also inspects the influence of controlling human capital on the salary gap between monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> competition <b>industries.</b> From Table  6 we can also see the changes on the proportion of the unreasonable part of the salary gap between the monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> competition <b>industries</b> when there is only control on human capital. But no matter what decomposition methods we use, there is no reversion on the ratio between unreasonable and reasonable parts. In the salary gap, inexplicable part still takes up a key share. Monopoly is still an important source of the salary gap between industries.|$|R
