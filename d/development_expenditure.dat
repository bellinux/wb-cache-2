In 2006, the Iranian government wiped out the financial debts of all universities in a bid to relieve their budget constraints. According to the UNESCO science report 2010, most research in Iran is government-funded with the Iranian government providing almost 75% of all research funding. Domestic expenditure on research stood at 0.7% of GDP in 2008 and 0.3% of GDP in 2012. Iranian businesses contributed about 11% of the total in 2008.
