40|$|Background: While {{there is}} {{mounting}} evidence that children of mothers with depression {{are at risk}} for increased psychopathology and disturbed family relationships, it is not yet known what the children's lives are like growing up with their mothers' depression. The {{purpose of the study was}} to understand children's experiences of living with mothers who have depression: specifically, how these children understand <b>disclosing</b> their experiences to others. Method: Eight interviews were conducted with adult children of mothers with depression. Grounded theory methodology was used to collect and analyze the data. Results: We identified three types of disclosing: self-disclosing, first <b>disclosing,</b> and selective <b>disclosing.</b> As the children grew up and began to understand their mothers' differentness as an illness, then as depression, their ways of <b>disclosing</b> changed, as did what they <b>disclosed,</b> where, when, and for what purposes. Most significantly, what is <b>disclosed</b> changed remarkably over time, depending on the offspring's perceptions of their mother's problem, the safety of <b>disclosing,</b> and the purpose and anticipated consequences of <b>disclosing.</b> Conclusion: The results indicate that <b>disclosing</b> is not a single event but rather occurs in various forms, repeatedly, over time and in response to several factors...|$|R
