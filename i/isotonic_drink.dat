Objective: To compare the effectiveness of <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink</b> and banana juice towards muscles endurance during 30 minutes of running. Method: This was a comparative quasi experimental research with pre-test and post-test design. The subjects were students of Faculty of Medicine, University of Diponegoro aged 18 - 24 years old (n = 16). The subjects did three treatments: without drink, <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink,</b> and banana juice.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effects of}} {{moderate}} beer consumption after physical activity on rehydration and fluid balance {{are not completely}} clear. Therefore, {{in this study we}} investigated the effect of beer consumption, with varying alcohol content, on fluid balance after exercise-induced dehydration. Methods: Eleven healthy males were included in this cross over study (age 24. 5 ± 4. 7 yrs, body weight 75. 4 ± 3. 3 kg, VO 2 max 58. 3 ± 6. 4 mL · kg · min- 1). Subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer for 45 min at 60 % of their maximal power output (Wmax) until mild dehydration (1 % body mass loss). Thereafter, in random order, one of five experimental beverages was consumed, in an amount equal to 100 % of their sweat loss: non-alcoholic beer (0. 0 %), low-alcohol beer (2. 0 %), full-strength beer (5. 0 %), an <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> and water. Fluid balance was assessed up till 5 hours after rehydration. Results: After 1 hour, urine production was significantly higher for 5 % beer compared to the <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> (299 ± 143 mL vs 105 ± 67 mL; p < 0. 01). At the end of the 5 h observation period net fluid balance (NFB) was negative for all conditions (p = 0. 681), with the poorest fluid retention percentage for 5 % beer (21 % fluid retention) and the best percentage for the <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> (42 %). Non-alcoholic beer, low-alcoholic beer and water resulted in fluid retention of 36 %, 36 % and 34 % respectively (p = 0. 460). Conclusions: There was no difference in NFB between the different beverages. Only a short-lived difference between full-strength beer and the <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> in urine output and NFB was observed after mild exercise-induced dehydration. Fluid replacement – either in the form of non-alcoholic beer, low-alcoholic beer, full-strength beer, water or an <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> of 100 % of body mass loss was not sufficient to achieve full rehydration.

40|$|Abstract — Coconut {{water is}} known as a nutritious natural drink. It is not only {{considered}} functional, but also nutraceutical. Coconut water is widely used as <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink</b> or oral rehydration fluid, since it showed excellent rehydration index and blood glucose response in previous researches. The quality of <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink</b> is determined by its sugar content (as the source of carbohydrate) and electrolyte content. Moreover, its organoleptic properties should be able to stimulate the urge to spontaniously drink more. However, the processing of coconut water into <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink</b> usually applies ultra high or very low temperature which might deteriorate its nutrition value and organoleptic properties, causing the needs to use a considerable amount of food additives. There are plenty varieties of coconut in Indonesia, each produces different characteristics of coconut water. The objectives of this research are to compare the carbohydrate-electrolyte characteristics of coconut water, and also other essential characteristics from several varieties and to determine which variety is closest to the quality standard of <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink.</b> Therefore, <b>isotonic</b> <b>drink</b> can be developed with only minimum food additives. We compared Dalam Pangandaran, Genjah Salak and Hybrid PB 121. The characteristics observed were total sugar, sucrose, glucose, fructose, potassium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B 1, vitamin B 6 and vitamin C content, as well as pH, total soluble solids, clarity and colour.

Physical exercise consisted of running on a motor-driven treadmill for 1 h/day, at 20 m/min, 5 days a week. The isotonic sports drink was a commercial solution used by athletes for rehydration after physical activity, 2 ml administered by gavage twice a day. Urine cultures were performed in all animals. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected in metabolic cages at the beginning and at the end of the protocol period. Urinary and plasma parameters (sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, calcium) did not differ among groups. However, an amorphous material was observed in the bladders of animals in the Exe + Drink and Drink groups.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposed}} a novel methodology for the quantification of an artificial dye, sunset yellow (SY), in soft beverages, using image analysis (RGB histograms) and partial least squares regression. The developed method presented many advantages {{if compared with}} alternative methodologies, such as HPLC and UV/VIS spectrophotometry. It was faster, did not require sample pretreatment steps {{or any kind of}} solvents and reagents, and used a low cost equipment, a commercial flatbed scanner. This method was able to quantify SY in <b>isotonic</b> <b>drinks</b> and orange sodas, in the range of 7. 8 – 39. 7 mgL− 1, with relative prediction errors lower than 10 %. A multivariate validation was also performed according to the Brazilian and international guidelines. Linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, bias, prediction uncertainty and a recently proposed tool, the β-expectation tolerance intervals, were estimated. The application of digital images in food analysis is very promising, opening the possibility for automation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of study: The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of brand extensions on parent brand image. For this purpose Johnson is selected as parent brand for current study. The selected brand extensions are Johnson shampoo, Johnson’s <b>isotonic</b> <b>drinks,</b> Johnson’s sportswear and Johnson’s suntan lotion. Research Methodology: sample was selected from Bradford, UK. Sample consists of consumer of Johnson including males as well as female. Total sample size is 250 and data was collected through self administered questionnaires. Convenience sampling was selected as sampling technique. Results: Correlation analysis indicated negative impact of brand extension on parent brand image if brand extension is done in different brand categories. Perceived brand quality and perceived brand fit of the extension also affect the parent brand image. Conclusion: It is concluded that if brand extension is done in the same product category of parent brand then there is possibly high acceptance for the brand extension rather than in the different product categories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Adequate {{hydration}} {{status in}} the sport is essential for good health, yet the relationship between hydration, proteinuria and sports is little studied. Objective: To analyze the influence of an <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> as rehydration strategy on the hydration status and proteinuria after karate training. Methods: Ten athletes participated in this study. In the first session of standard training, called observation training session (STO), the athletes hydrated themselves according to their habits, {{and in the second}} session of standard training, called nutritional intervention training session (STIN), an ideal practice of hydration protocol was followed, using an <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> as a rehydration liquid during the training. The hydration status was verified by monitoring the body weight before and after training, the urine specific gravity pre-and post-training and the urine volume post-training. To observe the influence of practice of hydration on the renal function post exercise proteinuria was measured. Results: We observed a statistically significant difference in urine density between the samples pre- and post-exercise only on STIN (p = 0. 047). When we compare the sessions, there was a lower variation in body weight (p = 0. 011) and higher urinary volume (p < 0. 001), on nutritional intervention training. In STO, there was a higher percentage of athletes who showed proteinuria (70 %) compared to the STIN (50 %) in the urine sample after training. Conclusion: The use of <b>isotonic</b> sports <b>drink</b> as practice of hydration by karate athletes promoted rehydration during one session of training and reduce post-training proteinuria...|$|R
