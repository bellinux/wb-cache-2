5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, UCL {{introduced}} the Margaret Murray Prize, {{awarded to the}} student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century. In 1969, UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour, but it was converted <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> in 1989. In June 1983, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visited the room and there was gifted a copy of Murray's My First Hundred Years. UCL also hold two busts of Murray, one kept in the Petrie Museum {{and the other in}} the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology. This sculpture was commissioned by one of her students, Violet MacDermot, and produced by the artist Stephen Rickard. UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by Winifred Brunton; formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery, it was later placed into the Art Collection stores.|$|E
5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

25|$|By 1825, {{the toilet}} {{had been removed}} and the {{bathroom}} space joined to the west bedchamber to create an office. This area {{was used for the}} President's office over the next several decades. Abraham Lincoln used it as both an office and a Cabinet room, and signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the room on January 1, 1863. During the Lincoln presidency, the walls were covered with Civil War maps. It had dark green wallpaper, and the carpeting was also dark green. Newspapers were stacked on the desk and tables along with large amounts of mail and requests from office seekers. Two large wicker wastebaskets were filled with debris. The east bedchamber was converted <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> for presidential aides, although President John Tyler used it as part of his office from 1841 to 1845.|$|E
25|$|Beyond Words moved <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> along Cornell Road in the Tanasbourne {{neighborhood}} of Hillsboro in 2006. In 2004, {{the company was}} struggling and considered filling for bankruptcy protection until a new investor was brought on board. That year Beyond Words had its first big success, after more than 250 titles to their name, with Masaru Emoto’s Hidden Messages of Water. The book sold {{enough to make the}} New York Times Best Seller list and sold a total of half a million copies. The company started a partnership with publisher Simon & Schuster’s subsidiary Atria Books in 2006. That same year the company had a dinner party where one of the commentators from The Secret DVD convinced the group to watch the video, which led to the publication of the book, The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. By March 2007, the book had become the top seller on Amazon.com as well as listing on The New York Times bestseller list, and had 1.75 million copies in print. That month Simon & Schuster ordered an additional 2 million copies in what was their largest reorder in their history. By 2003, the Secret had over five million copies in hardcover.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was {{amended to}} {{transform}} the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts {{by the government of}} the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial of}} Doherty {{and the other}} members of the M60 gang began in early May 1981, on charges {{including}} three counts of murder. On 10 June, Doherty and seven other prisoners, including Angelo Fusco {{and the other members}} of the IRA unit, took a prison officer hostage at gunpoint in Crumlin Road Jail. After locking the officer in a cell, the eight took other officers and visiting solicitors hostage, also locking them in cells after taking their clothing. Two of the eight wore officers' uniforms while a third wore clothing taken from a solicitor, and the group moved towards the first of three gates separating them from the outside world. They took the officer on duty at the gate hostage at gunpoint, and forced him to open the inner gate. An officer at the second gate recognised one of the prisoners and ran <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> and pressed an alarm button, and the prisoners ran through the second gate towards the outer gate. An officer at the outer gate tried to prevent the escape but was attacked by the prisoners, who escaped onto Crumlin Road. As the prisoners were moving towards the car park where two cars were waiting, an unmarked RUC car pulled up across the street outside Crumlin Road Courthouse. The RUC officers opened fire, and the prisoners returned fire before escaping in the waiting cars. Two days after the escape, Doherty was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum recommended term of thirty years.|$|E

500|$|In February 1912, Mackintosh married Gladys Campbell, {{and settled}} <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> job as {{assistant}} secretary to the Imperial Merchant Service Guild in Liverpool. The safe, routine work did not satisfy him: [...] "I am still existing at this job, {{stuck in a}} dirty office," [...] he wrote to a former Nimrod shipmate. [...] "I always feel I never completed my first initiation—so {{would like to have}} one final wallow, for good or bad!" [...] He was therefore delighted, early in 1914, to receive an invitation from Shackleton to join the latter's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which was to attempt the first crossing of the Antarctic continent.|$|E

500|$|Commander Keen was an {{immediate}} hit for Apogee: the company's previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas Keen already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as [...] "a little atom bomb" [...] to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it; its success led him to recruit his mother and hire his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players, and to quit his other job and move Apogee from his house <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office.</b> By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of PC Magazine later in 1991 referred to the game's release as a [...] "tremendous success".|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{discussion}} of demolishing {{the hall in}} the 1980s after the structure had become dilapidated. One proposal called for building a replica on the same site as the original, but school administrators opted to renovate Waller Hall. From November 1987 to November 1989 the [...] building went through a $2.26 million renovation. This renovation addressed interior issues with the building including seismic upgrades {{in the event of}} a large magnitude earthquake. These renovations also turned the attic <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>office</b> suite for the school’s president. After renovations in 1988 the building was used for university administration offices. Further renovations were completed in 2005 at a cost of $1.3 million for upgrading the 100-year-old windows to newer energy efficient models, repairing the brick, fixing leaks, installing skylights, re-painting, and slightly lightening the exterior red-brick coloring.|$|E

Lisa reluctantly admits that she knows {{everything}} about Roy, that her relationship with Roy is a sham, and that Roy is {{the first and only}} man in her life, as she had no other. Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E
