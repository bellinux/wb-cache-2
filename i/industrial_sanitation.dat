40|$|There {{have been}} {{extensive}} theoretical studies of firms'responses to environmental regulations ad enforcement but few empirical analyses of firms'expenditures on pollution abatement {{in response to}} different regulations and enforcement strategies. The authors empirically analyze the pollution abatement efforts of Chinese industrial firms under a system combining pollution charges and abatement subsidies. Using data on China's top industrial polluters and on regional development in China, they find {{that the combination of}} charges and subsidies used in china has provided effective incentives for the most heavily polluting industrial firms to abate pollution. Chinese industries operate under a unique pollution control system, a market-based instrument combining emissions charges and abatement subsidies. This combination of charges and subsidies has given firms incentive to invest in wastewater treatment facilities. The pollution levy, although low, has significantly improved investments in abatement. The authors found that the more pollution a firm generates, {{the more likely it is}} to invest in pollution abatement. This study was only of top polluters, which are closely monitored by environmental agencies, so the results may not be valid for other sources of <b>industrial</b> pollution. <b>Sanitation</b> and Sewerage,Environmental Economics&Policies,Pollution Management&Control,Public Health Promotion,Water and Industry,Water and Industry,Environmental Economics&Policies,Pollution Management&Control,TF 030632 -DANISH CTF - FY 05 (DAC PART COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2, 500 /AL,Sanitation and Sewerage...|$|R
5000|$|An early [...] "Back-to-Nature" [...] movement, which {{anticipated}} the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris, and Edward Carpenter, {{who were all}} against consumerism, pollution and other activities that were harmful to the natural world. The movement was {{a reaction to the}} urban conditions of the <b>industrial</b> towns, where <b>sanitation</b> was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical Utopia and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful.

Economically, Peru claimed to be attempting to run on a balanced budget, but Peru still held a large debt despite its positive foreign trade. However, despite these claims, Peru also began to mobilize its troops to its border with Ecuador in order to match the Ecuadorian troops which had been deployed to the dispute zone.|$|R

The largest group was indigenous Fijian, while other groups included Pacific Islanders, Indian, Chinese, European, and people of mixed origins. About a third were employed directly in mining (as miners, truckers, equipment and locomotive operators, drivers, fitters and turners, welders, blacksmiths, carpenters, electricians, mill operators, foremen, first aid attendants, clerks etc.). The remainder comprised their dependents, as well as tradespeople, storekeepers, teachers, police and public service officials. Housing at a basic level was available for most employees, emphasising potable water and <b>sanitation.</b> <b>Industrial</b> safety was promoted by the companies, while medical services (with government sjupport) were provided in the community. Primary and secondary educational services were supported variously by government, industry and religious groups. Reflecting the culture of British colonialism, all services were of an uneven standard and aligned along racial, cultural and religious lines.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge in {{the field}} of {{environmental}} health is growing rapidly. Within the context of external factors that define its boundaries, environmental health has evolved over time into a complex, multidisciplinary and ill-defined field with uncertain solutions. Many of the key determinants and solutions to environmental health lie outside the direct realm of health and are strongly dependent on environmental changes, water and <b>sanitation,</b> <b>industrial</b> development, education, employment, trade, tourism, agriculture, urbanization, energy, housing and national security. Environmental risks, vulnerability and variability manifest themselves in different ways and at different time scales. While there are shared global and transnational problems, each community, country or region faces its own unique environmental health problems, the solution of which depends on circumstances surrounding the resources, customs, institutions, values and environmental vulnerability. This work will contain critical reviews and assessments of environmental health practices and research that have worked in places and thus can guide programs and economic development in other countries or regions. <br /...|$|R
50|$|In 1815, {{soon after}} John Doulton had {{completed}} his apprenticeship as a potter, he invested his life savings of £100 in the Vauxhall Walk pottery of Martha Jones, Lambeth. Her foreman, John Watts, was also taken into partnership {{and the firm}} became known as Jones, Watts and Doulton. It specialized in industrial ware, brown stoneware, drain pipes as well as stoneware bottles for chemicals, beer, and other industrial liquids among others. Martha Jones withdrew from the partnership in 1820 and the company moved to new premises in Lambeth High Street in 1826. In 1835 John's 15-year-old son Henry Doulton was taken on as an apprentice. By 1846, Henry had set up an independent Lambeth Pottery which had become the leader in <b>industrial</b> products, particularly <b>sanitation</b> products. Following the retirement of John Watts in 1853, Doulton and Watts merged with Henry's company to become Doulton and Company and was highly recognised for its lines of hand decorated figurines, vases and dinnerware.|$|R

50|$|Surgeon General Blue {{the plague}} fighter became an {{institution}} builder as well. He inherited the Act of 1912, which reoriented PHS toward research and public campaigns against disease. Passage of the Act of 1912 capped 6 years of lively debate {{about how to}} strengthen Federal public health efforts more generally. It designated the U.S. Treasury Department’s Marine Hospital and Public Health Service, rather than the Department of the Interior, as the lead Federal agency (and shortened the name to PHS), responsible not only for interstate quarantine and health services delivery to Federal wards {{but also for the}} health of the general public. The Act stepped up Federal public health activities, most notably in response to repeated outbreaks of typhoid fever that tore through cities and towns that drew drinking water from increasingly contaminated supplies. The Act of 1912 authorized Hygienic Laboratory investigations into water pollution’s contribution to the disease burden, including a new field research station at Cincinnati, Ohio. Interstate guidelines were developed and put into effect to ensure potable water and pasteurized milk. PHS received authority to initiate field research independently of county and state health departments and to extend campaigns against infectious disease toward the control of occupational and environmental threats. During 1914 PHS opened an Office of <b>Industrial</b> Hygiene and <b>Sanitation</b> at the Marine Hospital in Pittsburgh, near the Department of the Interior’s new Bureau of Mines.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the American Industrial Hygiene Association began in the 1930s with {{interested}} people already meeting together {{under the auspices of}} other organizations to include the American Public Health Association, the American Chemical Society, the National Safety Council, and the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers. In 1938 {{the board of directors of}} the American Association of Industrial Physicians and Surgeons (AAIPS) organized a permanent American Conference on Occupational Diseases in response to a massive outbreak of lead poisonings in the automotive industry. Dr. Carey P. McCord as chairman of the Conference proposed the creation of an independent association of industrial hygienist who were not physicians and would operate under the name of the American Industrial Hygiene Conference.The 24th annual meeting of the AAIPS was held in June 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio during which an organizational meeting for the establishment of an industrial hygiene association was held on June 6, 1939. Initially the association was to be named the Society of Industrial Hygienists however was not supported and the consensus agreed on the name of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).Three officers for the new association were elected with William Yant, president; Warren Cook, president-elect; and Gordon A. Harrold, secretary-treasurer. The AIHA had 160 members at its start and paid annual dues of $3.00. Harrold reported from the first board of directors meeting on October 18, 1939 that the four major goals of the Association were:1. The advancement and application of <b>industrial</b> hygiene and <b>sanitation</b> through the interchange and dissemination of technical knowledge on these subjects.2. The furthering of study and control of industrial health hazards through determination and elimination of excessive exposures.3. The correlation of such activities as conducted by diverse individuals and agencies throughout industry, educational and governmental groups.4. The uniting of persons with these interests.|$|R
