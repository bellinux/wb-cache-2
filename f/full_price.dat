5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying <b>full</b> <b>price,</b> became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Telemark County Municipality had {{attempted}} to create a PSO contract for {{the operation of the}} Bratsberg Line, that had been transferred from the state to the county. Five private companies had bid, but all five had been disqualified and the county was forced to sign a concession contract with NSB instead, despite NSB not having bid in the tender. The same year, the national process was delayed one year. However, the government announced that the bidding would happen in three stages; first the Gjøvik Line and Bergen Commuter Rail, second the long-distance trains as well as the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and finally the rest of the Oslo Commuter Rail, as well as the Jæren Commuter Rail. Among the challenges was the ownership of the rolling stock and depots. The department considered creating a separate government-owned company that would own these. Since NSB had been converted to a limited company, it would be necessary for the state to purchase the trains and depots for <b>full</b> <b>price</b> from NSB. With 69 multiple units delivered within the past five years, this could become an expensive transaction for the state. An alternative was launched were NSB would have to lease locomotives, carriages and multiple units to the winner, and also sell tickets for them at railway stations, a solution that was later chosen. In September 2004, it was announced that current employees working for NSB along the Gjøvik Line would have the right to work for the winner, and could demand the same wage and pension rights as before.|$|E

25|$|The bill thus {{established}} {{a system in}} which Southern blacks could lease abandoned and confiscated land, with yearly rent at 6% (or less) of the land's value (assessed for tax purposes in 1860). After three years, they would have the option to buy this land at <b>full</b> <b>price.</b> The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military because Congress anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners.

25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of access to that property) pays the <b>full</b> <b>price</b> of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} ND started serving a more {{differentiated}} customer base and was increasingly {{dependent on the}} sales force coming with feedback as to which functionality needed to be developed. Norsk Tipping {{was in the first}} years of the 1970s the first customer to apply an ND system to accounting. The software was developed and owned by ND, but Skår rejected proposals that the company should develop a portfolio of administrative software. At the time this was based on the strategy that the high profit margins were in the central parts of the hardware while independent software firms were not making money. Towards the end of the 1970s this strategy started to backfire, as hardware-oriented customers, such as universities, were pressing down prices while companies which wanted turn-key solutions were increasingly willing to pay <b>full</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} how {{public utility}} prices {{should be changed}} over time and space. Earlier static and non spatial models of public utility pricing emerge as special cases of the theory developed here. Electricity is emphasized although the models {{can be used for}} natural gas and other public utilities. If the transactions costs of price changes were zero, optimal prices should be changed continuously as supply and demand conditions change. Such prices are referred to as "full spot" <b>prices.</b> The <b>full</b> spot <b>price</b> of electricity at any point and time depends on total demand, availability of generating units, short run marginal operating costs of generators, the spatial locations of all supplies and demands, and the configuration of the transmission and distribution system. Since all of these are stochastic, so are <b>full</b> spot <b>prices.</b> Optimal "wheeling charges", i. e. price differences between points, also vary stochastically. In practise actual prices must be changed discreetly, and are therefore only approximations to <b>full</b> spot <b>prices.</b> Price changes are of two basic types. Predetermined price changes are adequate to respond to anticipated changes in conditions. Price recalculations are needed to respond to unanticipated changes. The optimal timing and mix of recalculations and predetermined changes depend on: the transactions costs of each type of change; the stochastic and deterministic rates of change of full spot prices; and the ability of customers and suppliers to change behavior in response to different price patterns. Conventional time-of-use rates recalculate prices systematically only at occasional rate hearings, and change them only a few times a day. Such prices deviate greatly from <b>full</b> spot <b>prices,</b> for many utilities. The thesis models customer behavior under full spot and other time varying prices, and discusses the types of customers likely to get the largest benefits from <b>full</b> spot <b>pricing.</b> The final chapter simulates behavior by four customers under six rates, from flat prices calculated a year in advance, to <b>full</b> spot <b>pricing.</b> The gross social welfare benefits of <b>full</b> spot <b>pricing,</b> before transactions costs, are three to ten times the benefits of conventional time-of-use pricing. The gross benefits of <b>full</b> spot <b>pricing</b> are less than ten percent of the customers' total energy costs. For small customers this {{may not be enough to}} counterbalance higher :ransactions costs from spot pricing. The thesis calculates "breakeven sizes" for each customer type such that larger customers should be on <b>full</b> spot <b>pricing.</b> These are on the order of one megawatt, for the customers and utility system modeled. The thesis suggests that, for many large customers and independent power producers, conventional time-of-use rates are dominated by properly calculated prices which change every hour and are recalculated at least daily. For some other customers, rates of intermediate sophistication are best...|$|R
