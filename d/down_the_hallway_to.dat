60|$|Breaking {{the thought}} off abruptly, he passed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> dim <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} club-rooms. He raised the axe {{and was about to}} smash the lock when he espied a key in the keyhole. The door was not locked. Lane set <b>down</b> <b>the</b> axe and noiselessly turned the knob and peeped in. The first room was dark, but the door on the {{opposite}} side was ajar, and through it Lane saw the larger lighted room and the shiny floor. Moving figures crossed the space. Removing the key, Lane slipped inside the room and locked the door. Then he tip-toed to the opposite door.|$|R

When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg.

50|$|On September 29, 2014, Judge Tynia Richard {{offered a}} sharp rebuke to the Department of Corrections, recommending that six {{corrections}} officers be fired. This group, led by Captain Budnarine Behari, {{had participated in}} the brutal beating of Robert Hinton, a mentally ill inmate, while he was hog-tied, because he had protested being moved from his cell by sitting down. Hinton's fellow inmates watched as he was dragged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> while hog-tied <b>to</b> a solitary confinement cell where he was beaten. While this ruling {{was one of the most}} severe against the Department of Corrections in many years, almost two years had elapsed between the beating and the Justice Department's ruling, during which time the perpetrators in this attack were involved in more inmate beatings at Rikers Island.|$|R

While {{preparing}} for the wedding, Marge suggests to Homer that he match his tie to her eyes, to which he casually replies that he never notices petty details like eye color. Shocked, Marge covers her eyes so Homer cannot see them unless he remembers their color. While the Van Houtens are on their cruise honeymoon, Kirk carries Luann <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> their private room.

5000|$|The {{little girl}} is then seen pushing a {{wheelchair}} in which Perry sits in a hospital gown, trembling with the poisoned strawberry in one hand. In the hallway, they are blocked by two minotaur guards who block their way. The little girl furiously goes {{up to them and}} stomps her foot, sending the minotaurs flying. Perry gets up from the wheelchair, grabbing the little girl's hand as they run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the exit. The doors open to reveal a garden. A man dressed as Prince Charming appears riding a unicorn, and walks to Perry with fingers crossed behind his back. Perry punches him in the face, sending him through the fence. Perry and the girl find a heart-shaped exit, and the two girls high-five. They hug each other before the little girl places something in Perry's closed fist. The little girl rides away into a suburban neighborhood on a bike with a license plate reading [...] "Katheryn". Perry returns to her dressing room and opens her fist, revealing a butterfly. The camera pans to a stage where Perry stands on a rising platform, and sings the beginning bars of [...] "Teenage Dream".|$|E
5000|$|Soap Opera Digest {{columnist}} Carolyn Hinsey {{stated that}} she was at her Indiana University sorority house when the wedding took place. [...] "Laura Spencer [...] - [...] like the actress portraying her, Genie Francis [...] - [...] was only 19 {{at the time and}} leading a much more glamorous life than the girls in Indiana could imagine," [...] she said. [...] "The relationship had creepy overtones, given that Luke had raped Laura two years earlier, and yet it captured the imagination."

5000|$|The {{music video}} opens with Billy Talent {{playing in a}} darkened church. The video also follows the path of an altar boy. The boy is asleep in his room when a dark fog enters his room. The fog {{represents}} the priest and enters the room when the line [...] "Footsteps <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> floor/Getting closer <b>to</b> my door" [...] are sung. The boy runs from the fog and into the church's basement, where he finds an apparently insane man bound in ropes. The boy runs from the room and {{is followed by the}} fog. He then grabs an axe trying to defend himself. The boy runs to the main room of the church where Billy Talent are playing. Instead of the band, mouthless altar boys are standing in the room, the young boy also mouthless. The boys are the priests' victims and are mouthless to represent {{the fact that they have}} been silenced by the priest, hence the line [...] "Silent night for the rest of my life", and in the demo, [...] "I was told that the world wouldn't believe me".|$|R
40|$|DERVISH to {{navigate}} in an artificial office environ-ment, the official {{goal of the}} contest was to push the technology of robot navigation in real office buildings with minimal domain information. DERVISH navigates reliably using retractable assumptions that simplify the planning problem. In this article, we present a short description of DERVISH’s hardware and low-level motion mod-ules. We then discuss this assumptive system in more detail. The judges are ready, and DERVISH knowsits mission: Exit the room in which ithas been placed, navigate <b>down</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> goal room’s two doors, and enter the goal room. DERVISH begins by exiting the room. Turning to align itself with <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> it begins <b>to</b> move toward the near door of the goal room, {{which is just a}} few feet in front. This run should be easy, so the robot thinks. Oops! DERVISH sees a hallway on its left and knows that the hall-way is opposite the door. DERVISH must have missed the door. DERVISH backs up to where the door must be and searches back and forth a few feet, looking for an opening. Finding none, DERVISH decides that this door must be closed; replans to the far door of the goal room; and begins <b>to</b> move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> again, heading for the far door. Uh-oh! A large object is in front, blocking the robot’s path. DERVISH searches to find a way around the object but to no avail; it must be a block-ade, so DERVISH plans <b>to</b> use another <b>hallway.</b> After successfully traveling {{to the other side of}} the office building, DERVISH reaches <b>the</b> final <b>hallway,</b> slowly but surely approaching the far door. DERVISH reaches the door and keeps going. The audience gasps in despair, thinking for an instant that DERVISH has missed the door, but DERVISH stops, backs up to the door, and enters the room. The crowd cheers. So it was that DERVISH won the Office Deliv-ery event of the 1994 Robot Competition an...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after 1:30 pm on June 13, 2008, Russert {{collapsed}} at {{the offices}} of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C. bureau of NBC News where he was chief.

Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert's heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old. In accordance with American journalistic tradition, the public announcement of Russert's death was withheld by the wire services and his network's competitors, until Russert's family had been notified. Retired NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw then delivered, live on NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC, the news of his death. NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams was on assignment in Afghanistan and could not anchor the special report. CBS and ABC also interrupted programming to report Russert's death. Armen Keteyian reported the news for CBS and Charles Gibson reported for ABC. Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Rome, Italy, where he had celebrated his son's graduation from Boston College. While his wife and son remained in Rome, Russert had returned to prepare for his Sunday television show.|$|E
