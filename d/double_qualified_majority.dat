40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{has brought}} {{remarkable}} changes and innovations to the European Union. As {{far as the}} Council of Ministers of the European Union (“the Council” hereinafter) is concerned, there are two significant innovations: <b>double</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting and new rotating Presidency scheme, which are considered to make the working of the Council more efficiently, stably and consistently. With the modification relating to other key institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament, and with certain procedures being re-codified, {{the power of the}} Council varies accordingly, where the inter-institutional balance counts for more research. As the Council is one of the co-legislatures of the Union, the legislative function of it would be probably influenced, positively or negatively, by the internal innovations and the inter-institutional re-balance. Has the legislative function of the Council been reinforced or not? How could the Council better reach its functional goal designed by the Treaties’ drafter? How to evaluate the Council’s evolution after Lisbon Treaty in the light of European integration? This thesis is attempting to find the answers by analyzing two main internal innovations and inter-institutional re-balance thereinafter...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{the impact of a}} new system of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting under the Lisbon Treaty on the {{position}} of member states in the Council. The paper mainly deals with potential transformation of member states weight in the Council. With the help of so-called power indexes, the absolute and relative voting power of member states in the Council will be determined. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> is introduced also in the historical development, i. e., how its form ranged from the emergence of the European Communities to the present. Emphasis is of course placed on detailed description of the key articles of the Lisbon Treaty, relating to <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting in the Council. The answer to the question whether the new criteria of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> will mean a different result of the vote in the Council, can be found in the fourth chapter of this thesis. An important element of analysis of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> under the Lisbon Treaty is its comparison with the Nice system in terms of fairness and efficiency. At the conclusion of this thesis, the historical development of the expansion of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting in the Council at the expense of unanimity is included.
