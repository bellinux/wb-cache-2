40|$|The main {{methods for}} {{improving}} the efficiency or power of the combined cycle are: increasing the inlet temperature of the gas turbine (TIT), inlet air-cooling, applying gas reheat, steam or water injection into the gas turbine (GT), and reducing the irreversibility of the {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG). In this paper, gas reheat with recuperation was applied to the regular triple-pressure steam-reheat combined cycle (the Regular cycle) by replacing the GT unit with a recuperated gas-reheat GT unit (requires two gas turbines, gas recuperator, and two combustion chambers). The Regular cycle with gas-reheat and gas-recuperation (the Regular Gas Reheat cycle) was modeled including detailed modeling of the combustion and GT cooling processes and a feasible technique to reduce the irreversibility of its HRSG was introduced. The Regular Gas Reheat cycle and the Regular Gas Reheat cycle with reduced-irreversibility HRSG (the Reduced Irreversibility cycle) were compared with the Regular cycle, which is the typical design for a commercial combined cycle. The effects of varying the TIT on the performances of all cycles were presented and discussed. The results indicate that the Reduced Irreversibility cycle is 1. 9 - 2. 15 percentage points higher in efficiency and 3. 5 % higher in the total specific work than the Regular Gas Reheat cycle, which is 3. 3 - 3. 6 percentage points higher in efficiency and 22 - 26 % higher in the total specific work than the Regular cycle. The Regular Gas Reheat and Reduced Irreversibility cycles are 1. 18 and 3. 16 percentage points; respectively, higher in efficiency than the most efficient commercially-available combined cycle at the same value of TIT. Economic analysis was performed and showed that applying gas reheat with recuperation to the Regular cycle could result in an annual saving of 10. 2 to 11. 2 million US dollars for a 339 Â MW to 348 Â MW generating unit using the Regular cycle and that reducing the irreversibility of the HRSG of the Regular Gas Reheat cycle could result in an additional annual saving of 11. 8 million US dollars for a 439 Â MW generating unit using the Regular Gas Reheat cycle.

50|$|The first {{process step}} in the {{catalytic}} stage is the gas heating process. It is necessary to prevent sulfur condensation in the catalyst bed, {{which can lead to}} catalyst fouling. The required bed operating temperature in the individual catalytic stages is achieved by heating the process <b>gas</b> in a <b>reheater</b> until the desired operating bed temperature is reached.|$|R
30|$|A general {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to specify the}} performance of an irreversible gas turbine Brayton cycle incorporating two-stage compressor, two-stage <b>gas</b> turbine, intercooler, <b>reheater,</b> and regenerator with irreversibilities due to finite heat transfer rates and pressure drops. Ranges of operating parameters resulting in optimum performance (i.e., ηI ≥ 38 ≥ ηII ≥ 60 %, ECOP ≥ 1.65, xloss ≤ 0.150 MJ/kg, BWR ≤ 0.525, wnet ≥ 0.300 MJ/kg, and qadd ≤ 0.470 MJ/kg) are determined and discussed using the Monte Carlo method. These operating ranges are minimum cycle temperature ranges between 302 and 315 K, maximum cycle temperature ranges between 1, 320 and 1, 360 K, maximum cycle pressure ranges between 1.449 and 2.830 MPa, and conductance of the heat exchanger ranges between 20.7 and 29.6 kW/K. Exclusive effect {{of each of the}} operating parameters on each of the performance parameters is mathematically given in a general formulation that is applicable regardless of the values {{of the rest of the}} operating parameters and under any condition of operation of the cycle.|$|R

These operating ranges are as follows: minimum cycle temperature ranges between 302 and 315 K, maximum cycle temperature ranges between 1, 320 and 1360 K, maximum cycle pressure ranges between 1.449 and 2.830 MPa, and conductance of the heat exchanger ranges between 20.7 and 29.6 kW/K.
