5000|$|Bunker fuel or bunker crude is {{technically}} {{any type of}} fuel oil used aboard vessels. It gets {{its name from the}} tanks on ships and in ports that it is stored in; {{in the early days of}} steam they were coal bunkers but now they are bunker fuel tanks. The Australian Customs and the Australian Tax Office define a bunker fuel as the fuel that powers the engine of a ship or aircraft. Bunker A is No. 2 fuel oil, bunker B is No. 4 or No. 5 and bunker C is No. 6. Since No. 6 is the most common, [...] "bunker fuel" [...] is often used as a synonym for No. 6. No. 5 fuel oil is also called Navy Special Fuel Oil (NSFO) or just navy special; No. 5 or 6 are also commonly called heavy fuel oil (HFO) or <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (FFO); the high viscosity requires heating, usually by a recirculated low pressure steam system, before the oil can be pumped from a bunker tank. Bunkers are rarely labeled this way in modern maritime practice.|$|E

30|$|The {{desulphurization}} process yields 18.85 %– 26.58  wt% tar {{derived from}} decomposition {{with respect to}} the feedstock. In terms of the indicators, the tar meets the requirements for <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> based on the “ 100 ” mark.

30|$|As noted above, the {{oxidative}} desulphurization of lignite produces {{volatile organic}} compounds that when condensed from a paste-like or semi-liquid brown substance (a decomposition tar).

30|$|After {{analysing}} {{the results}} obtained (Table  9), {{it can be concluded}} that against all the characteristics of lignite tar after oxidative purification complies with the standard for <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> of “ 100 ” mark and can, therefore, be used as fuel.

30|$|The study {{reviews the}} process of {{oxidative}} desulphurization of high-sulphur Ukrainian lignite, which was performed by coal treatment using an air or air–steam mixture. In the process, sulphur-free fuel and tar from the decomposition of coal organic matter was obtained. Hence, the sulphur in the coal was converted into hydrogen sulphide. The coal desulphurization process is critical to power generation, power generation and technology, and technology field of application. The coal desulphurization process ensures the maximum recovery of the highest content of sulphur and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) in desulphurized gases at minimal energy costs. The process also enhances the maximum decomposition of tar and sulphur recovery (>[*] 50 %) during coal power generation. Based on summarized field studies, a block schematic diagram coupled with heat and material balances of the process was developed for the calculations. The application of the technology at {{the first stage of}} coal combustion in thermal power plants will enable the utilization of over 50 % of recovered coal sulphur in the form of concentrated H 2 S or commercial elemental sulphur. This will, nevertheless, allow for a reduction of sulphur oxide pollution in the environment by at least 53 %– 56 %. It has been suggested that the product of thermal decomposition of coal organic matter (tar) {{can be used as a}} component of <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> or as a plasticizer of petroleum-based road bitumen.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{present study was}} the {{simulation}} of an oil spill accompanied by burial of significant amount of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) in coastal sediments. Approximately 1, 000 kg of sediments collected in Messina harbor were spiked with Bunker C <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (6, 500 ppm). The rapid consumption of oxygen by aerobic heterotrophs created highly reduced conditions in the sediments with subsequent recession of biodegradation rates. As follows, {{after three months of}} ageing, the anaerobic sediments did not exhibit any significant levels of biodegradation and more than 80 % of added Bunker C fuel oil remained buried. Anaerobic microbial community exhibited a strong enrichment in sulfate-reducing PHs-degrading and PHs-associated Deltaproteobacteria. As an effective bioremediation strategy to clean up these contaminated sediments, we applied a Modular Slurry System (MSS) allowing the containment of sediments and their physical-chemical treatment, e. g. aeration. Aeration for three months has increased the removal of main PHs contaminants up to 98 %. As revealed by CARD-FISH, qPCR and 16 S rRNA gene clone library analyses, addition of Bunker C fuel oil initially affected the activity of autochthonous aerobic obligate marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OMHCB), and after one month more than the third of microbial population was represented by Alcanivorax-, Cycloclasticus- and Marinobacter-related organisms. In the end of the experiment, the microbial community composition has returned to a status typically observed in pristine marine ecosystems with no detectable OMHCB present. Eco-toxicological bioassay revealed that the toxicity of sediments after treatment was substantially decreased. Thus, our studies demonstrated that petroleum-contaminated anaerobic marine sediments could efficiently be cleaned through an in situ oxygenation which stimulates their self-cleaning potential due to reawakening of allochtonous aerobic OMHCB...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} types of fuel and energy resources. Fuel and non-fuel products of new consumer properties can be produced on its basis. Implementation of the accumulated technological potential of coal conversion is an up-to-date trend of the coal industry innovative development in Russia and in the Primorye Territory as well. The Primorye Territory is the second region in Russia by consumption volume of fuel oil for the needs of housing and utility services. Twenty percent of the region boilers are working using this type of fuel. Fuel oil for Primorye is imported from other regions. In this regard, one of the main problems in the housing sector of the Primorye Territory is the provision of <b>furnace</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and its high cost for the budget to be able to purchase the fuel for the heating season. To solve this problem it has been proposed to organizesynthetic liquid fuels production using Primorsky brown coal. The technology for converting coal into synthetic liquid fuels was developed long ago. The research of coal processing is being done all over the world now. Coal is the most perspective raw material for the production of synthetic liquid fuel in Russia, because it is the most common form of fossil fuels. Brown coals are the most perspective for processing, because there are considerable reserves of this kind of coal, it is of relatively low cost, due to their consumer properties they are limited for using in heating and electricity production. The primary objective is to develop the design and estimating documentation for constructing plants with the capacity of 500 thousand tons of liquid products per year in the areas situated far from refineries and having coal-mining enterprises, including unprofitable and surface coal mines. Primorye Territory belongs to such areas. The implementation of this project in Primorye has a significant socio-economic efficiency, which results in the budget savings, the creation of new jobs, ensuring employment in miner's villages, and additional tax revenues to the budget. There are all opportunities to realize this project in Primorye on the basis of Pavlovsky brown coal deposit with 400 million tons reserves to use for more than 130 years...|$|E
