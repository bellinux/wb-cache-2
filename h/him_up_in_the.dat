5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E

Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case {{is a waste of time}} and they should return to Washington.|$|E

At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E

25|$|Davis came {{to public}} {{prominence}} after his {{performance at the}} 1980 World Championship, where he reached the quarter-finals, defeating defending champion Terry Griffiths en route, before losing to Alex Higgins. Davis won his first major title {{in the same year}} – the UK Championship – during which he beat Griffiths 9–0 in the semi-finals and Higgins 16–6 in the final. This began an 18-month period of dominance. He won the Classic and then the International Masters and English Professional titles in 1981, and became the bookmakers' favourite to win the 1981 World Championship, despite being seeded only 15. Davis reached the final by defeating Jimmy White in the first round, Higgins in the second round, Griffiths in the quarter-finals and defending champion Cliff Thorburn in the semi-final. Davis's 18–12 victory over Doug Mountjoy in the final confirmed bookmakers' early predictions, and in celebration his manager Barry Hearn charged across the arena to lift <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. He would go on to reach seven out of the next eight world finals. Peculiarly, Davis's first four world finals were each against a player of a different nationality, something that had not occurred before and has not since.|$|E

It becomes apparent that each brother thought the other was guilty of killing Deacon, but each {{was willing to take}} the blame himself or at least shield the other. When they are interviewed, Will relates that he encountered Deacon, who had come to retrieve the emeralds, in the church on 30 December. Will had married Mary after the war, believing her a widow. Now he realised Deacon was still alive, making his and Mary's marriage bigamous and their daughters illegitimate. Desperate to prevent Deacon from exposing his family to pain and scandal, Will tied <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bell-chamber, planning to bribe him to leave, but became helpless with Spanish influenza next day. Will's delirious talk led Jim to find Deacon's body in the bell-chamber on 2 January. He assumed that Will had murdered him. Appalled but loyal, he waited until the night after Lady Thorpe's funeral on 4 January, made the body unrecognisable and hid it in the new grave, then left for sea. When the body was discovered, Will assumed Jim had killed Deacon. Neither can explain how Deacon died. Both are released. Will marries Mary again in Bloomsbury and they return to Fenchurch St. Paul.|$|E

During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket.
