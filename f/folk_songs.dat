This research project is primarily an investigation into the range of ways that English composers throughout this period have engaged with English <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> in their writing, with the accompanying aim of using this knowledge to write music within this particular tradition of repertoire myself. Three main areas of enquiry have been undertaken.

Secondly, exploring compositional methodologies and strategies for interacting with extant musical materials generally and <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> sources specifically. Thirdly, studying a wide range of related compositional precedents in the works of other composers, including those from other countries in order to provide the broadest possible perspective. Out of these investigations a portfolio of new compositions has been written, including an extended six movement piano cycle which surveys in a contemporary idiom the subject of compositional engagement with English <b>folk</b> <b>song</b> from a range of different perspectives, aesthetics and critical interactions...|$|R
