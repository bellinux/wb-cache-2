40|$|What pilots {{do on the}} job {{frequently}} is {{analyzed in}} terms of individual skills and human factors. Performances often do not consist of separable skills but of a holistic event, which can be analyzed into irreducible, mutually constitutive moments. A discursive psychology approach was {{used to analyze the}} discourse of <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> based on 7 extended interviews about performance aspects. This study shows that in the discourse of <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> cockpit performance is presented holistically, even though it manifests itself in different ways. Six main discourse repertoires are identified in examiners' discourse about flight deck performance, each of which has between 3 and 5 identifiable subdimensions. Case studies show the connectedness and interdetermination of the 6 main repertoires for talking about what pilots do and how they do it. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate how pilots of different rank evaluate flight-deck performance. In each study, the pilots were asked to assess sets of three different videotaped scenarios featuring pilots in a simulator exhibiting poor, average, and good performance. Study 1, which included 92 airline pilots of differing rank, was aimed at comparing how individuals rate performance. The subjects used a standardized assessment form, which included six criteria, each having a 5 -point rating scale. Analysis of the first study revealed that there was considerable variance in the performance ratings between <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> captains, and first officers. The second {{study was designed to}} better understand the variance. Eighteen pilots (six <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> six captains, and six first officers) working in pairs evaluated performances, in a modified think-aloud protocol. The results showed that there were good reasons for the observed variances. The results are discussed in relation to inter-rater reliability. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate how pilots of different rank evaluate flight-deck performances shown in videotaped scenarios. Study one consisted of 92 airline pilots of differing rank. The second study involved eighteen pilots (six <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> six captains, and six first offices) evaluating performances in pairs of similar-ranked pilot. Both studies asked subjects to examine 3 different videos featuring pilots in a simulator exhibiting poor, average, and good performance. The subjects used a standardized assessment form, which included six measures, each having a 5 -point rating scale. Study 1 had pilots assess individually, where study two asked paired pilots to collectively assess the performance of pilots using a single assessment form. Preliminary analyses of the first study show that there are great variations in the performance ratings within <b>flight</b> <b>examiners,</b> captains, and first officers. These variations are taken up in the second study, which reveals reasons for why the pilots of all ranks arrived at very different assessments. The results are interpreted {{with respect to the}} potential of improving pilots' reflections on practice. Full Tex...|$|R

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its operating limitations. The required pre-flight weight and balance computations would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its weight and balance operating envelope, but in this instance the pilot in command, as a former military pilot, was neither accustomed to nor responsible for computing weight and balance computations during his military career, as this was the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus it is believed he may have by force of habit overlooked this responsibility as a civilian pilot is required to do. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin engine aircraft. [...] Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the [...] "centerline thrust" [...] restriction from his pilot's certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the <b>flight</b> <b>examiner</b> was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a [...] "history of incomplete or substandard check-rides". Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements, with disastrous results. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be [...] beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as [...] "hot and high" [...] (high density altitude, producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees {{less than a mile from}} the airport.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a current}} trend in {{aviation}} to use categories of technical (e. g., knowledge) and nontechnical skills (e. g., situation awareness) to assess airline pilots' performance. Several studies have revealed large disagreement between assessors when airline professionals use these categories {{to assess the}} performance of their peers. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the categories themselves are at the source of disagreement. We explore the reasoning of <b>flight</b> <b>examiners</b> who assess an engine fire scenario in pairs. The results provide insight into the overlap of topics that constitute certain categories.

50|$|As {{they left}} {{commercial}} service, many 880s were bought by American Jet Industries for various uses. One example was converted to freighter use in 1974, and flew until 1982 with various companies. Another {{was used to}} train FAA <b>flight</b> <b>examiners</b> until it was destroyed by a minor explosion in the cargo hold in 1995. Most of the remaining examples were scrapped by 2000.The United States Navy acquired one 880-M in 1980, modifying it as an in-flight tanker. It had been purchased new from Convair by the FAA, and used for 18 years. Unofficially designated UC-880, it {{was assigned to the}} Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and employed in Tomahawk Cruise Missile testing and aircraft refueling procedures. Convair designed and manufactured the Tomahawk and Advanced Tomahawk Cruise Missile in San Diego where the 880 and 990 were produced. The sole UC-880 was damaged in a cargo hold explosive decompression test at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1995. The aircraft managed to remain theoretically controllable via backup systems unique to the 880 and 990.|$|R
40|$|Research into {{expertise}} is relatively common in cognitive science concerning expertise existing across many domains. However, much less research has examined how experts {{within the same}} domain assess {{the performance of their}} peer experts. We report the results of a modified think-aloud study conducted with 18 pilots (6 first officers, 6 captains, and 6 <b>flight</b> <b>examiners).</b> Pairs of same-ranked pilots were asked to rate the performance of a captain flying in a critical pre-recorded simulator scenario. Findings reveal (a) considerable variance within performance categories, (b) differences in the process used as evidence in support of a performance rating, (c) different numbers and types of facts (cues) identified, and (d) differences in how specific performance events affect choice of performance category and gravity of performance assessment. Such variance is consistent with low inter-rater reliability. Because raters exhibited good, albeit imprecise, reasons and facts, a fuzzy mathematical model of performance rating was developed. The model provides good agreement with observed variations. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional StudiesFull Tex...|$|R
