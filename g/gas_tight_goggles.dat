30|$|Composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> {{reservoirs}} that {{exhibit the}} composite features of conventional <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs and deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs {{are controlled by}} buoyancy and hydrocarbon molecular expansive force during the early and late accumulation stages, respectively. The main controlling factors of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir accumulation can thus be classified into two subsidiary sets. One set {{is associated with the}} accumulation of conventional <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, mainly cap rocks (C), gas reservoirs (D), low fluid potential areas (P), and source kitchens (S). The other is associated with deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, mainly universal reservoir densification (L), stable tectonic settings (W), widely distributed reservoirs (D), and source rocks in a close contact with reservoirs (S). Therefore, we infer that the development of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs is driven by the following six main factors S, D, C, W, P, and L, with the accumulation process depending on the spatiotemporal combination of these functional elements, and with the development model shown by “T-CDPS + T-LWDS” (Pang et al. 2014). The genetic mechanisms of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs are thus a recombination of conventional tight and deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir accumulations, resulting in the complex gas–water relationships and full gas-bearing properties.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Building {{upon the}} {{foundation}} of the prior investigations, a three-fold classification of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs is proposed in this paper which is based primarily on dynamic relationship between gas charging history and reservoir tight-ening process, coupled with tectonic evolution, source-reservoir relationship, migration and charging pattern. The three categories of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> are: (1) “pre-existing ” basin-centered gas reservoir, in which the reservoir sands experienced early-stage tightening processes, occurring before peak gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir; (2) “pre-existing subsequent-improved ” <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir, in which the reservoir sands were also tightened before gas charging and then underwent reservoirs improvement mainly caused by the tectonic activities; and (3) “subsequent-conventional ” <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir where reserved sands were tightened after the peak of gas generation, expulsion from source rock, and charging of reservoir. This type of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> initially formed conventional gas accumulation during gas charging of reservoir, and subsequently modified to <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoir. All the three categories of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> have different geological conditions of gas accumulation and gas accumulation patterns, which can be used as characteristics to classify these <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> systems, and thus have distinctive control on regional gas distribution. The results of applying this <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> classification for an actual basin show that correctly distinguishing these three kinds of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs from eac...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{conventional}} tight reservoirs {{are characterized}} by: distribution in structurally high areas; partial enrichment in zones of relatively high porosity and permeability; no direct connection between sources and reservoirs; overlaying cap rocks that {{play a significant}} role in sealing processes; a uniform gas–water interface; higher inner pressure than hydrostatic pressure under a stable state; continuously high pressure; and relatively small distribution areas and reserve scales. By trap type, conventional tight reservoirs can be subdivided into anticlinal <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, fault block <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, lithological <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, and stratigraphic <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs (Pang et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|Composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> {{reservoirs}} {{are distributed}} widely in anticline belts, deep depressions, and slope zones {{as a result}} of superimposition of conventional and deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs in deep basins, also including buoyancy-adjusted deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs reconstructed through subsequent fault or fracture development (e.g., subsequent inner-sag uplifting). Gas charging and accumulation processes are based on early buoyancy and then later on molecular expansive force. Composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs are formed through accumulation followed by densification and re-accumulation, and two genetic mechanisms can be identified. Driven by the first mechanism, conventional tight and deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs of the same depth form before and after reservoir densification, respectively. Given the order of gas accumulation processes, composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs are superimposed by different reservoir types following a period of multi-phase hydrocarbon expulsion. The other mechanism refers to partial uplifting in deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs induced by subsequent tectonic adjustments and improved reservoir physical properties close to those of conventional reservoirs (low porosity and high permeability) {{as a result of}} fault and fracture reconstruction. Buoyancy then occurs again, changing partial gas–water distribution and maintaining large gas-bearing areas in deep <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs, ultimately leading to the development of composite <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs of an adjusted genesis (Pang et al. 2013, 2014).|$|R

The source rocks of the Xul Member and reservoir rocks of the Xu 2 Member are thick (Xul Member: 40 m, Xu 2 Member: 120 m) and are distributed continuously in this study area.
