5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} <b>ghost.</b> <b>In</b> the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task.

In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the <b>ghost.</b> <b>In</b> 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E
