The accreditation is done by professionals who are qualified to determine air ambulance safety. In addition, compliance with accreditation standards is done on a continual basis by the accrediting organization.

2500|$|Elsewhere, {{the novel}} {{approach}} to pre-hospital care was also evolving. [...] Portland's Leonard Rose, M.D., {{in cooperation with}} Buck Ambulance Service, instituted a cardiac training program and began training other paramedics. Baltimore's R.

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} the utilisation {{and safety of}} air <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> (AMS), when being used for inter-facility transfers of paediatric patients in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Methods. A retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted for the time period January 2010 to December 2011. Data were recorded from the Cape Town base of the AMS provider for the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Services.</b> Patient demographics, <b>flight</b> and transfer details, interventions performed and adverse events encountered were documented for all patients 10 % from baseline were the most common critical adverse events encountered (6 %). Conclusion. Current utilisation of the AMS for paediatric inter-facility transfer is relatively high, at ~ 25 %. Across both the helicopter and fixed-wing platforms, patients with a diverse range of pathologies of equally varying severities were transferred. The adverse events observed {{were found to be}} lower than those of trials examining non-specialised paediatric transfer, and were comparable to those seen with transfer by specialised paediatric retrieval teams. The AMS remain a safe and viable alternative to non-specialised paediatric transfer, and may serve as a potential alternative to specialised paediatric transfer in the Western Cape...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal {{intubation}} is {{a common}} intervention in critical care patients undergoing helicopter <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> (HEMS) transportation. Measurement of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressures is not common practice in patients referred to our service. Animal studies have demonstrated an association between {{the pressure of the}} ETT cuff on the tracheal mucosa and decreased blood flow leading to mucosal ischemia and scarring. Cuff pressures greater than 30 cmH 2 O impede mucosal capillary blood flow. Multiple prior studies have recommended 30 cmH 2 O as the maximum safe cuff inflation pressure. This study sought to evaluate the inflation pressures in ETT cuffs of patients presenting to HEMS. METHODS: We enrolled a convenience sample of patients presenting to UMass Memorial LifeFlight who were intubated by the sending facility or <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> (EMS) agency. <b>Flight</b> crews measured the ETT cuff pressures using a commercially available device. Those patients intubated by the flight crew were excluded from this analysis as the cuff was inflated with the manometer to a standardized pressure. Crews logged the results on a research form, and we analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel and an online statistical analysis tool. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 55 patients. There was a mean age of 57 years (range 18 - 90). The mean ETT cuff pressure was 70 (95...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{dispatch}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> at {{the onset}} of acute stroke is vital in expediting assessment and treatment. We examined the relationship between callers' description of potential stroke symptoms to the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher and the subsequent classification and prioritisation of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> response. AIM: To identify key 'indicator' words used by people making emergency calls for suspected stroke, comparing these with the subsequent category of response given by the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher. METHOD: A retrospective chart review (hospital and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services)</b> in North West England (October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007) identified digitally recorded <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> calls, which related to patients who had a diagnosis of suspected stroke at some point on the stroke pathway (from the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> call taker through to final medical diagnosis). Using content analysis, words used to describe stroke by the caller were recorded. A second researcher independently followed the same procedure in order to produce a list of 'indicator' words. Description of stroke-specific and nonstroke-specific problems reported by the caller was compared with subsequent <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> dispatch coding and demographic features. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-three calls were made to <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> of which 592 (92...|$|R

The <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> System and Prehospital <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> Care Personnel Act (California Health and Safety Code sections 1797 et seq.) created the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> Authority in 1980.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{organization}} of pre-hospitalization emergency care {{in the event of}} a traffic accident involving multiple human injuries. It characterizes the activities of the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service.</b> The objective of this thesis is to map in detail the organization of pre-hospitalization emergency care {{in the event of a}} traffic accident involving multiple human injuries. However, the established structure of the organization applies to any emergency involving multiple human injuries. Two research questions were defined for the research part of the thesis; they focused on the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the Central Bohemia Region and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region in order to obtain research value. The first research question focused on comparing the ways in which paramedics were prepared to deal with emergencies in traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries at the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the Central Bohemia Region. The second research question was intended to map the solutions of traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries at the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the Central Bohemia Region and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region from 2002 to 2012. The methodology selected for the research part of the thesis was a method using a qualitative research conducted through interviews in the form of semi-controlled interviews with paramedics with the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region and the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the Central Bohemia Region. The research group was composed of paramedics from two <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> from each of which five respondents were selected randomly. Processing of the results relating to the first research question, which dealt with comparing the ways in which paramedics are prepared to deal with emergencies in traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries, showed that although the structure of the training is largely determined by law and, therefore, it is very similar at both the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services,</b> there is a striking difference in the access and participation of paramedics to the training organized. The paramedics with the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> of the Central Bohemia Region do not participate in theoretical preparations regularly, compared to their counterparts, even if they are organized every year. Processing of results relating to the second question, which focused on mapping the solutions of traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries, showed that the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region participated in a much more serious traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries than the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the Central Bohemia Region. The description of the procedures selected by paramedics at the scene of a traffic accident clearly shows that they had to use disaster medicine procedures, such as triage using sorting identification cards, for rescue and disposal operations. It can be clearly concluded that they are an <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> far more experienced in the procedures for dealing with traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries are. When examining the organization of pre-hospitalization emergency care in the event of a traffic accident involving multiple human injuries I found out, using the methods of qualitative research conducted through interviews in the form of semi-controlled interviews carried out at two <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services,</b> some differences concerning theoretical training and actual procedures of dealing with traffic accidents involving multiple human injuries. The cause of these differences can be seen mainly in the frequency of occurrences of emergencies in the South Bohemia Region. For this reason, I see the paramedics with the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> of the South Bohemia Region as more experienced...|$|R

40|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> {{that are}} available, accessible, {{and used by}} the Northwest Indian Tribes of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington {{run the gamut from}} {{volunteer}} fire departments to paid county-wide paramedic services. The study was conducted in order to objectively describe the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> available to tribes of the Pacific Northwest and make recommendations regarding the training, funding, operation and governance of the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> programs and personnel. Narrative descriptions of the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> programs for each of the 34 Tribes are presented in a uniform format that discusses: description of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> used; problems or concerns documented; policy considerations; assessment of major components; and actions for improvement. Data collection, sampling, and data analysis procedures are not given. However, much of the information is related in narrative and table form. Based on fieldwork and information collected from all 34 federally-recognized Northwest Tribes, the study finds that <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> are a major health need that, in many instances, is not being met. As many as twelve Northwest Reservations lack basic life support programs and {{there is a need to}} improve training and coordination of services area-wide. The following problems were noted Area-wide: 1) too few ambulance services available to ensure adequate coverage at all times; 2) county and local governments do not have the funding to pay for full-time ambulance personnel or procure equipment; 3) distance to in-patient facilities means the patient will often have to spend considerable time in transit; 4) <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> personnel receive few calls and are often unable to keep up their skills; and 5) there are shortages of medical personnel, including physicians. Consumer knowledge of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> on most Northwest Reservations is recognized as poor. Recommendations inlcude: 1) IHS should make funds available during fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to implement first response programs for the Hoh, Quileute, Muckleshoot, Chehalis, Umatilla, and Squaxin Island Tribes; 2) training of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> personnel must be a major priority of the Portland Area IHS over the next three years, with Community Health Representatives making up a major part of the needed manpower; 3) all Portland Area Service Units should have an appointed <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> program officer to provide direct technical assistance to all Tribes in the unit; 4) tribal specific health plans regarding <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> need to be updated, and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> planning must be a part of all future disaster planning efforts; 5) Congress should make funding available over the next three fiscal years for the development and improvement of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
