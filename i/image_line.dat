For instance Q factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive severely detract from this figure.

50|$|Single-lens medium format cameras {{represented}} Rollei's {{most important}} market segment. Consequently, {{development of the}} SLX continued, resulting in the 6006 which was introduced in 1984. Significant improvements included a film magazine and TTL flash metering - superior technology that made it the leading medium format camera. The 6002 followed in 1986, an entry-level model without a film magazine along with three inexpensive lenses (f/4, 50 mm; f/2.8, 80 mm; f/4, 150 mm). For the first time Rollei offered low-cost lenses from Asia, although {{all of the other}} lenses were still made by Schneider and Zeiss. In 1988, Rollei introduced the 6008. In addition to improved electronics, this was the first medium format camera to include automatic exposure bracketing; demand for this feature was so great that it led to a five-month lead time. The 6008 SRC 1000 was introduced in 1992, which made exposures of 1/1000 second possible for the first time. The 6008 Integral followed in 1995, then came the 6008 AF with auto-focus, and finally the 6008i2 - a stripped-down version of the AF. The introduction of the scan-back (an attachment that digitally scanned the <b>image,</b> <b>line</b> by line) launched Rollei into the professional digital imaging market as early as 1991, and with great success.|$|E
50|$|As seen here, {{the image}} has been {{divided into four}} groups of lines: group A {{contains}} every fourth line, group B contains lines immediately following ones in group A, group C likewise contains the lines immediately following those in group B, and group D contains the remaining lines, which are between group C lines (immediately above) and group A lines (immediately below). These are stored into the file in the order A, C, B, D, {{so that when the}} file is transmitted the second received group (C) of lines lie centered between the lines of the first group, yielding the most spatially uniform and recognizable image possible, composed of only two of the groups of lines. The same technique can be applied with more groups (e.g. eight), in which case at each step the next group to be sent contains lines lying at or near the centers of remaining bands that are not yet filled with image data. This method, with four or eight groups of lines, was commonly used on the early World Wide Web {{during the second half of}} the 1990s. Rather than leaving the background (black) showing as in the illustration above, the partial image was often presented on screen by duplicating each line to fill the space below it down to the next received <b>image</b> <b>line.</b> The end result was a continuous image with decreased vertical resolution that would increase to full resolution over a few seconds as the later parts of the image data arrived.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A line {{in space}} is {{projected}} to a conic in a central catadioptric image, and such a conic is called a <b>line</b> <b>image.</b> This paper proposes a novel approach to calibrating catadioptric camera and detecting <b>line</b> <b>images</b> simultaneously by using Hough transform. Previous approaches to catadioptric cameras calibration employ the traditional conic detecting or fitting methods for <b>line</b> <b>images,</b> and then use these recovered conics to estimate the intrinsic parameters based on some properties of <b>line</b> <b>images.</b> However, the type of a <b>line</b> <b>image</b> can be <b>line,</b> circle, ellipse, hyperbola or parabola, and in general only a small arc of the conic is visible in the image, which brings novel challenges for conic detection and fitting where traditional conic detecting and fitting methods may fail. As we know, {{the accuracy of the}} estimated intrinsic parameters highly depends on the accuracy of the extracted conics. The main contribution of this work is we show that all <b>line</b> <b>images</b> from catadioptric cameras with the same intrinsic parameters must belong to a family of conics with only two degree-of-freedom, and such a family is called a <b>line</b> <b>image</b> family. Therefore, we present a novel special Hough transform for <b>line</b> <b>images</b> detection which ensures that all detected conics must belong to a <b>line</b> <b>image</b> family related to certain intrinsic parameters. For all possible values of the unknown intrinsic parameters, the <b>line</b> <b>image</b> special Hough transform are performed. The one with the highest confidence is chosen as the estimated values for these unknown intrinsic parameters, and the corresponding results of <b>line</b> <b>image</b> detection are chosen as the estimated values for <b>line</b> <b>images.</b> In order to make the searching process more efficient, the hierarchical approaches are employed in this paper. The validity of our proposed approach is illustrated by experiments. Index Terms – Camera calibration, omnidirectional camera, Hough transform, feature extraction, line features...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{approach}} the problem of insitu camera calibration using an auxiliary mobile color-depth camera. The calibration is based on <b>image</b> <b>lines</b> and the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT). Calibration includes intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and radial distortion. Traditionally, camera calibration methods based on DLT combine 2 D and 3 D points. Using 2 D <b>image</b> <b>lines</b> allows adding simple image processing methods for fine tuning the calibration data (lines). Experimental comparison of points and lines based calibration shows that the automatic fine tuning of the lines is beneficial for the calibration process in noisy conditions. Experiments on both synthetic and real setups show that despite the low computational complexity of the DLT, the proposed calibration methodology yields promising accurate results. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of accurate 3 D models from {{a set of}} images is an important and difficult problem in computer vision. The general problems considered in this thesis are how to compute the camera parameters and build 3 D models given a set of 2 D images. ^ The first set of algorithms presented in this thesis {{deal with the problem}} of camera calibration in which {{some or all of the}} camera parameters must be determined. A new analytical technique is derived to find relative camera poses for three images, given only calibrated 2 D <b>image</b> <b>line</b> correspondences across three images. Then, a general non-linear algorithm is developed to estimate relative camera poses over a set of images. Finally, the presented algorithms are extended to simultaneously compute the intrinsic camera parameters and relative camera poses from 2 D <b>image</b> <b>line</b> correspondences over multiple uncalibrated images. ^ To reconstruct and refine 3 D lines of the models, a multi-image and multi-line triangulation method using known correspondences is presented. A novel non-iterative line reconstruction algorithm is proposed. Then, a robust algorithm is presented to simultaneously estimate a model consisting of a set of 3 D lines while satisfying object-level constraints such as angular, coplanar, and other geometric 3 D constraints. ^ Finally, to make the proposed approach widely applicable, an integrated approach to matching and triangulation from noisy 2 D image points across two images is first presented by introducing an affinity measure between image point features, based on their distance from a hypothetical projected 3 D pseudo-intersection point. A similar approach to matching and triangulation from noisy 2 D <b>image</b> <b>line</b> segments across three images is proposed by introducing an affinity measure among 2 D <b>image</b> <b>line</b> segments via a 3 D pseudo-intersection line. ...|$|E
