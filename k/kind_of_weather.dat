5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term for the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved {{in the opposite direction}} of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven's meditations on illness, {{conscience}} and mortality in the Late String Quartets {{led to his}} dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see String Quartet No. 15) as a [...] "Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent". John Lennon's work [...] "Imagine" [...] owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track [...] "The Inner Light" [...] sets to Indian raga music a verse from the Tao Te Ching that [...] "without going out of your door you can know the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie The Mission the guilty {{conscience and}} penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone ("On Earth {{as it is in}} Heaven") The song Sweet Lullaby by Deep Forest is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called [...] "Rorogwela" [...] in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother. The Dream Academy song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather...</b> letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{informed}} the fans waiting outside the venue {{that the show}} would be general admission, and told everyone to get {{as close to the}} stage as possible, regardless of the seating assignment on their tickets. Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the worst <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather,</b> rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come." [...] Two hours before the concert, the downpour subsided and settled into a misty drizzle. The 9,000-person venue had sold out, but because of the inclement weather, only about 4,400 fans attended.|$|E

[...] In this Jupiter and the gods assemble {{to listen to}} complaints about the weather and to reform abuses. Naturally everybody wants his own <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather.</b> The climax is reached by a boy who announces that a boy's pleasure consists in two things, catching birds and throwing snowballs, and begs for the weather to be such that he can always do both. Jupiter decides that he will do just as he pleases about the weather, and everybody goes home satisfied.|$|E
60|$|Off started Peter, lipperty-lipperty-lip.
