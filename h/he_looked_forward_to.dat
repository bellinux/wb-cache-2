5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E

It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called , it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by Eli Roth and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> seeing their names on the big screen.

25|$|With {{popularity}} came {{controversy over}} the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard to say that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington {{to dinner at}} the White House. To his dismay, this sparked a bitter, and at times vicious, {{reaction}} across the heavily segregated South. Roosevelt reacted with astonishment and protest, saying that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> many future dinners with Washington. Upon further reflection, Roosevelt wanted {{to ensure that this}} had no effect on political support in the South, and further dinner invitations to Washington were avoided; their next meeting was scheduled as typical business at 10:00am instead.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1967 English cricket season, it {{was agreed}} that each county club could {{immediately}} sign a non-English player for the 1968 season. Seven clubs approached Sobers and, on 14 December 1967, Nottinghamshire announced that he had signed for them and had been appointed club captain. Sobers stated that, although he had enjoyed his time in league cricket, he had a definite preference for the first-class game and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> restoring Nottinghamshire's fortunes.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Star-Ledger, said the episode was satisfying, although {{he felt it}} was short on laughs, except for Jim's antics with the tuxedo and the episode's documentary-style interviews. Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> seeing where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said [...] "watching Jim flail for approval [...] one of the episode's most awkward delights", but he said the episode was really about [...] "the type of man Michael Scott really is". Labrecque also said <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> seeing how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, [...] "For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' was a pretty good episode." [...] He particularly liked the ending, which {{he said he did not}} see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles. Several reviewers particularly praised the line about the [...] "two-way petting zoo", a zoo in which people pet the animals and the animals pet back.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} The Five {{as a unit}} was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove {{themselves}} from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply [...] "with complete frankness", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was [...] "a fully fledged artist" [...] and that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.|$|E

500|$|Prefix writer Craig Hubert {{rated the}} album 5 out of 10, {{and said it}} had more [...] "definable hooks" [...] than most other metal albums, but that still made the record no better or more accessible. He did note that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> when the band reached their full potential, which he felt the new record's music {{indicated}} would be soon. Speaking from his perspective as an aged listener and {{someone who is not}} a fan of modern rock music, Jay Bennett of the Phoenix New Times gave the album a grade of B. He described the album as “a pleasant surprise”, saying that he was not a fan of metal from recent years but that the album has “a lot more in common with the late-‘70s and early-‘80s-era Judas Priest and Iron Maiden”, which he liked.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{maintained}} {{they had}} achieved what {{the car was}} capable of with fourth and fifth-place finishes for Schumacher and Rosberg respectively.

Alonso was disappointed with the team's performance in what Ferrari identified as their 800th start, yet <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> upgrades in the following races. James Key, the technical director of BMW Sauber, was happy with the double finish and the one point the team picked up, courtesy of Kobayashi. Despite setting the race's fastest lap, Petrov was disappointed to not finish in a points-scoring position. He said it was bad luck but stated there were many positives he could take from the event and hoped that he could achieve a stronger result in Canada.|$|E

500|$|One of Hitler's {{sub-goals}} for {{the invasion}} of Russia was to win over Britain to the German side. He believed that after the military collapse of the USSR, [...] "within a few weeks" [...] Britain would be forced either into a surrender or else come to join Germany as a [...] "junior partner" [...] in the Axis. Britain's role in this alliance was reserved to support German naval and aerial military actions against the USA in a fight for world supremacy conducted from the Axis power bases of Europe, Africa and the Atlantic. On August 8, 1941, Hitler stated that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> the eventual day when [...] "England and Germany [...] together against America" [...] and on January 7, 1942, he daydreamed that it was [...] "not impossible" [...] for Britain to quit the war and join the Axis side, leading to a situation where [...] "it will be a German-British army that will chase the Americans from Iceland".

500|$|Steinbeck enjoyed {{writing the}} book; {{it was a}} {{challenge}} to apply his novel-writing skills to a scientific subject. However, he doubted from an early stage that the book would sell well. He considered {{it would be a good}} read, but not for the [...] "take-a-book-to-bed public". As he progressed further, he began to see that the book would have very limited appeal, but equally he was convinced that it was a good book and the best work he had done. He was happy that it took his writing in a new direction and would confound the attempts of the critics to pigeonhole him, and, with a slightly masochistic joy <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> their [...] "rage and contempt". In that, he was proved incorrect; the reviews were mixed, but largely favorable, focusing on his affirmation of humankind's place in the wider environment, and picking up on the excitement Steinbeck and Ricketts felt for their subject.John Steinbeck: The Contemporary Reviews pp.201–13 Most felt that even though there were moments when Steinbeck was at his best, the blending of philosophy, travelogue and biological recording made for an uneven read: ...|$|E
