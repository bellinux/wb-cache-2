50|$|Social status {{hierarchies}} {{have been}} documented {{in a wide range}} of animals: apes, baboons, wolves, cows/bulls, <b>hens,</b> even <b>fish,</b> and ants. Natural selection produces status-seeking behavior because animals tend to have more surviving offspring when they raise their status in their social group. Such behaviors vary widely because they are adaptations to a wide range of environmental niches. Some social dominance behaviors tend to increase reproductive opportunity, while others tend to raise the survival rates of an individual’s offspring. Neurochemicals, particularly serotonin, prompt social dominance behaviors without need for an organism to have abstract conceptualizations of status as a means to an end. Social dominance hierarchy emerges from individual survival-seeking behaviors.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{synthesise}} sufficient vitamin D through sunlight in human subjects can be limited. Thus, diet {{has become an}} important contributor to vitamin D intake and status; however, {{there are only a}} few foods (e. g. egg yolk, oily fish) naturally rich in vitamin D. Therefore, vitamin D-enriched foods via supplementing the animals’ diet with vitamin D or vitamin D fortification of foods have been proposed as strategies to increase vitamin D intake. Evidence that cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) and calcifediol (25 (OH) D 3) content of eggs, fish and milk increased in response to vitamin D 3 supplementation of <b>hens,</b> <b>fish</b> or cows’ diets was identified when vitamin D-enrichment studies were reviewed. However, evidence from supplementation studies with hens showed only dietary 25 (OH) D 3, not vitamin D 3 supplementation, resulted in a pronounced increase of 25 (OH) D 3 in the eggs. Furthermore, evidence from randomised controlled trials indicated that a 25 (OH) D 3 oral supplement could be absorbed faster and more efficiently raise serum 25 (OH) D concentration compared with vitamin D 3 supplementation. Moreover, evidence showed the relative effectiveness of increasing vitamin D status using 25 (OH) D 3 varied between 3 · 13 and 7 · 14 times that of vitamin D 3, probably due to the different characteristics of the investigated subjects or study design. Therefore, vitamin D-enrichment or fortified foods using 25 (OH) D 3 would appear to have advantages over vitamin D 3. Further wellcontrolled studies are needed to assess the effects of 25 (OH) D 3 enriched or fortified foods in the general population and clinical patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} approach in accounting for hierarchical differentiation in biology {{and the social}} sciences considers a hierarchy as a static distribution of individuals possessing differing amounts of some valued commodity, assumes that the hierarchy is generated by micro-level processes involving individuals, and attempts to reverse engineer the processes that produced the hierarchy. However, sufficient experimental and analytical results are available to evaluate this {{standard approach}} in the case of animal dominance hierarchies (pecking orders). Our evaluation using evidence from hierarchy formation in small groups of both <b>hens</b> and cichlid <b>fish</b> reveals significant deficiencies in the three tenets of the standard approach in accounting for the organization of dominance hierarchies. In consequence, we suggest that a new approach is needed to explain the organization of pecking orders and, very possibly, by implication, for other kinds of social hierarchies. We develop an example of such an approach that considers dominance hierarchies to be dynamic networks, uses dynamic sequences of interaction (dynamic network motifs) to explain the organization of dominance hierarchies, and derives these dynamic sequences directly from observation of hierarchy formation. We test this dynamical explanation using computer simulation and find a good fit with actual dynamics of hierarchy formation in small groups of hens. We hypothesize that the same dynamic sequences are used in small groups of many other animal species forming pecking orders, and we discuss the data required to evaluate our hypothesis. Finally, we briefly consider how our dynamic approach may be generalized to other kinds of social hierarchies using the example of the distribution of empty gastropod (snail) shells occupied in populations of hermit crabs...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} {{has been}} linked to cancer. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is the most pro-inflammatory lipid and one of the downstream products of 2 isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes: COX- 1 and COX- 2. Although both COX isoforms have similar structure and function, they are encoded by different genes and show distinct expression patterns. COX- 1 is expressed in most cells and tissues and remains constant under most physiologic conditions to play a housekeeping role whereas the COX- 2 form is inducible and usually only expressed in response to various inflammatory stimuli. COX enzymes may be involved in both tumor establishment and maintenance of existing tumors. PGE 2 exerts its effects on target cells by coupling to four subtypes of receptors which have been classified as EP 1 - 4. Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy and mainly occurs in older women. Prevention may be the best approach to reduce ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women and the most lethal gynecological malignancy. There are at least 3 well established risk factors for ovarian cancer: age, family history and environmental factors. Ovarian cancer is mainly seen in older women when their ovaries are not reproductively functional. Close to half of the women with ovarian cancer (48 %) are in the age group of 65 or older. Epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate that increased dietary intake of omega- 3 fatty acids (OM- 3 FAs) reduces the incidence and growth of various cancers. Thus, increasing the consumption of OM- 3 FAs may be a nontoxic way to prevent or suppress ovarian cancer. Flaxseed is the richest vegetable source of omega- 3 fatty acids which may be effective in the prevention of ovarian cancer. Fish oil is a source of OM- 3 FAs which may be effective in prevention of ovarian cancer. The main OM- 6 FA, Linoleic Acid (LA), is a direct precursor of the Arachidonic Acid (AA). Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the main OM- 3 FA found in flax oil, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the OM- 3 FAs in fish oil. ALA is elongated to form EPA and DHA in the intestine. Celecoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug that selectively inhibits COX- 2. There are evidences showing that Celecoxib has some anti-cancer properties. Progress in the treatment and prevention of ovarian cancer has been hampered {{due to the lack of}} an appropriate animal model and absence of effective chemo-prevention strategies. The domestic hens spontaneously develop ovarian adenocarcinomas that share similar histological appearance and symptoms such as ascites and metastasis with humans. Our first objective was to investigate the effect of flaxseed supplementation for one year on ovarian cancer and correlate its effects to expression of COX enzymes and concentrations of prostaglandins. White Leghorn hens were fed 10 % flaxseed-enriched or standard diet for one year. The severity of ovarian cancer was determined by gross pathology and histology. COX- 1 and COX- 2 localization and protein and mRNA expression and PGE 2 and PGE 3 concentrations in ovaries were measured by Immunohistochemistry, western blot, quantitative real-time PCR and LC-MS-MS, respectively. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in late stage ovarian tumors in the flaxseed-fed hens compared with the control diet-fed hens. In correlation with decreased ovarian cancer severity, concentrations of PGE 2 and expression of COX- 2 were diminished in ovaries of flaxseed-fed hens. PGE 3 concentrations were below the level of detection. The results demonstrated that in normal ovaries, COX- 1 was localized to the granulosa cell layer surrounding the follicles and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) whereas COX- 2 protein was localized to the granulosa cell layer in the follicle. Extensive COX- 1 and COX- 2 protein expression was found throughout the ovarian carcinoma. Our findings suggest that the flaxseed-mediated reduction in the severity of ovarian cancer in hens is correlated to the reduction in PGE 2 in the ovaries of flaxseed-fed hens. Since no effect on ovarian cancer incidence was detected after feeding the 2. 5 year old hens with 10 % flaxseed for 1 year, we designed a long-term study using 6 month old hens. Our objectives were: 1) to examine the expression of COX enzymes and PGE 2 levels in ovaries and correlate them to ovarian cancer and aging 2) to determine if long-term consumption of a flaxseed enriched diet decreases ovarian cancer severity and incidence in the laying hen and to investigate its potential correlation with the expression of COX enzymes and PGE 2 concentration. White Leghorn hens were fed 10 % flaxseed-enriched or standard diet for 4 years. The severity and incidence of ovarian cancer were determined by gross pathology and histology. COX- 1 and COX- 2 protein and mRNA expression and PGE 2 concentrations in ovaries were measured by western blot, quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Our results indicated an increase in ovarian cancer incidence and expression of both COX enzymes in ovaries of older hens. In correlation with ovarian cancer incidence and COX enzymes expression, PGE 2 concentrations were elevated with age. Ovaries with tumor had elevated COX- 1 expression and PGE 2 concentration compared to normal ovaries. Our findings suggest that the up-regulation of COX enzymes with age is the main contributing factor in the age associated increase in PGE 2. Furthermore, elevated PGE 2 in ovaries of hens concomitant with age suggests its important role in early stages of ovarian carcinogenesis. The results demonstrated that there was a reduction in ovarian cancer severity and incidence in hens fed flaxseed diet. In correlation with decreased ovarian cancer severity and incidence, concentration of PGE 2 and expression of COX- 2 were diminished in ovaries of hens fed flaxseed. Our findings suggest that the lower levels of COX- 2 and PGE 2 are the main contributing factors in the chemo-suppressive role of long-term flaxseed consumption in ovarian cancer in laying hens. These findings may provide the basis for clinical trials of dietary intervention targeting prostaglandin biosynthesis for the prevention and treatment of ovarian cancer. Based on our previous findings, targeting COX expression and prostaglandin biosynthesis by dietary intervention using OM- 3 FAs and selective COX inhibitor can be an effective approach to prevent or suppress ovarian cancer. Thus, we conducted a series of studies to assess effect of fish oil, flax oil, Celecoxib, fish oil and Celecoxib combined or flax oil and Celecoxib combined on COX- 1 and COX- 2 expression, PGE 2 concentrations, proliferation and apoptosis in normal and cancerous ovaries of laying hens. This study had not been performed in hens before, thus the first step was to find the optimum doses. In order to do so, we utilized one year old hens, divided them to groups of 6 hens, and fed them different doses of fish oil (50, 100, 175, 375 and 700 mg/kg), flax oil (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg) or Celecoxib (35, 65 and 100 mg/kg) for three weeks. The OM 3 -FAs andomega- 6 fatty acids contents of egg yolks were determined by gas chromatography. Proliferation, apoptosis,COX- 1, COX- 2 and prostaglandin receptor subtype 4 (EP 4) protein and mRNA expression and PGE 2 concentration in ovaries were measured by PCNA, TUNEL, western blot, quantitative real-time qPCR and ELISA, respectively. The results indicated that 100 mg/kg fish oil was the most effective dose in reducing COX enzymes and PGE 2, and increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in ovaries. The lower doses of fish oil incorporated more OM- 3 FAs into yolks, reduced OM- 6 FAs and increased the egg laying frequency but did not affect EP 4 expression. Unlike fish oil, the highest dose of flax oil (1500 mg/kg) caused the most significant reduction in COX expression and PGE 2 concentration. Celecoxib was not perfectly selective in targeting COX- 2, however, treating the hens with 65 mg/kg Celecoxib resulted in the most significant amelioration of PGE 2 levels in ovaries. Using the optimum doses of fish oil, flax oil and Celecoxib, we aimed to investigate if these components can alter ovarian cancer end-points in normal and cancerous hen ovaries. There is an adverse relation between ovulation and health of ovaries. Thus, 3 - 4 year old hens were monitored for egg laying frequency and the hens with the least ovulation rate were selected for health assessment. The hens presenting poor health were scanned using ultrasound and if tumor mass and/or ascites were detected, they were chosen for this study. The hens with normal and cancerous ovaries were divided to groups and were fed fish oil, flax oil, Celecoxib, fish oil and Celecoxib combined, or flax oil and Celecoxib combined for 42 days. The results showed that fish oil and flax oil increased the incorporation of OM- 3 FAs into egg yolks in both normal and cancerous ovaries of <b>hens.</b> <b>Fish</b> oil reduced COX- 1 and COX- 2 in normal and cancerous ovaries. Fish oil, flax oil and Celecoxib reduced the COX- 2 expression in ovaries. Combination of fish oil and Celecoxib and flax oil and Celecoxib decreased COX and PGE 2 more than each of these treatments alone. The cancerous ovaries of <b>hens</b> treated with <b>fish</b> oil, flax oil, Celecoxib, and flax oil and Celecoxib combined increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to cancerous ovaries of control hens. The cancerous ovaries of <b>hens</b> treated with <b>fish</b> oil and Celecoxib had the highest number of apoptotic cells indicating that the combination of fish oil and Celecoxib is more effective than fish oil or Celecoxib alone. To our knowledge the present study provides the first insight into the efficacy of fish oil, flax oil, Celecoxib, alone or combined on the reduction of COX enzyme expression, PGE 2 concentration and apoptosis in the normal and cancerous ovaries and further demonstrates the utility of the hen model for ovarian cancer. Our studies provided new insight into the potential mechanism of action of flaxseed, fish oil, flax oil and Celecoxib in the reduction of ovarian cancer and will establish the foundation for clinical trials to test the efficacy of dietary intervention for the prevention and suppression of ovarian cancer in women...|$|R
40|$|The health {{benefits}} related to omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFA), {{and more specifically}} the long chain (LC) n- 3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are generally recognized. Since {{the conversion of the}} shorter chain n- 3 PUFA α-linolenic acid (ALA) to the n- 3 LC-PUFA EPA and DHA is rather limited, the direct intake of EPA and DHA is of great importance. However, the daily intake of these n- 3 LC-PUFA is below the daily recommended intake of 250 mg EPA+DHA, due to the inadequate consumption of food products naturally rich in n- 3 LC-PUFA, such as fatty fish. In this context, enrichment of commonly consumed foods with n- 3 LC-PUFA can raise the intake of these fatty acids to the recommended level. Eggs, for example, are generally consumed and form {{an integral part of the}} diet, all over the world. Furthermore, the n- 3 PUFA profile can easily be modified by supplementation of different n- 3 PUFA sources to the diet of the laying <b>hens.</b> <b>Fish</b> oil, as n- 3 LC-PUFA source, can, for example, be supplemented to the diet of the laying hens to enrich eggs with n- 3 LC-PUFA. However, because of the declining fish stocks and the off-flavours present in the eggs, alternative n- 3 LC-PUFA sources must be found. Microalgae can be very promising since the n- 3 LC-PUFA present in fish originate from microalgae. Research has already been performed on the supplementation of heterotrophic microalgae (i. e. they obtain their nutrients and energy from organic compounds which are produced by other organisms, via fermentation processes). However, from a sustainability viewpoint, it would be more interesting to use autotrophic microalgae (i. e. they use light and CO 2 to form their biomass) as alternative n- 3 LC-PUFA source to enrich eggs with n- 3 LC-PUFA. The global aim of this doctoral work was therefore to study the supplementation of autotrophic microalgae to the diet of laying hens to enrich eggs with n- 3 LC-PUFA. First of all, it was shown that the supplementation of different microalgal species (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Nannochloropsis oculata, Isochrysis galbana and Chlorella fusca), leads to different n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiencies in the egg yolk, due to the different n- 3 PUFA profiles and the different bioaccessibility of the n- 3 PUFA. ALA rich sources, such as Chlorella, lead to the lowest n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency since the conversion of ALA to n- 3 LC-PUFA is rather limited. n- 3 LC-PUFA rich sources such as Phaeodactylum, Isochrysis and Nannochloropsis lead to significantly higher n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiencies. However, the enrichment efficiency when using Nannochloropsis is drastically lower in comparison with Phaeodactylum and Isochrysis. Nannochloropsis contains a cell wall, which is very hard to digest and thus may lead to a lower bioaccessibility of the n- 3 PUFA compared to the other autotrophic microalgal species Isochrysis and Phaeodactylum, which do not contain a (rigid) cell wall. This was confirmed by comparing the n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency obtained by supplementation of Nannochloropsis to the diet of the laying hens in either intact or disrupted form. The disrupted form, with a higher bioaccessibility of the n- 3 PUFA, lead to significant higher n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiencies compared to the intact form. The n- 3 LC-PUFA profile, on the other hand, has less influence on the n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency since no difference was observed between the disrupted form of Nannochloropsis (EPA sources) and Isochrysis (DHA source). Not only different microalgal species lead to different n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiencies, but also the supplementation dose has a significant impact. An increase in enrichment efficiency, obtained by supplementation of Isochrysis to the diet of the laying hens, was observed until a supplementation dose of 120 mg n- 3 PUFA per 100 g feed but at higher n- 3 PUFA doses, a decrease in enrichment efficiency was observed. Thus, 120 mg n- 3 PUFA per 100 g feed is the most appropriate supplementation dose. Furthermore, it was observed that the enrichment of n- 3 LC-PUFA in the egg yolk is a gradual process, with the maximal enrichment after 14 days of supplementation. In addition to the enrichment of n- 3 LC-PUFA in the egg yolk by supplementation of autotrophic microalgal species to the diet of the laying hens, changes in the egg yolk color were also observed, due to carotenoid enrichment in the egg yolk. This could lead to additional benefits such as a higher protection of the n- 3 LC-PUFA against oxidation due to the antioxidative nature of several carotenoids. However, since the yolk color is an important quality parameter, it should remain within the range of consumer acceptability. To evaluate the n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency obtained by the supplementation of commercial n- 3 PUFA sources (flaxseed, fish oil and a commercially available heterotrophic microalgal species, i. e. Schizochytrium) compared to autotrophic microalgae, a comparative study was conducted. Isochrysis was selected as the most optimal microalgal species to use since it leads to the highest n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency while still retaining an acceptable yolk color. The four n- 3 PUFA sources were supplemented in the same n- 3 PUFA supplementation dose: 120 mg n- 3 PUFA per 100 g feed. This study showed that next to the n- 3 PUFA profile also the bioaccessibility of the n- 3 PUFA plays an important role. Fish oil (as EPA and DHA source) leads to the highest n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiency compared to the other n- 3 PUFA sources. This suggested a higher bioaccessibility of the n- 3 PUFA supplemented as oil compared to n- 3 PUFA supplemented as biomass. The difference in enrichment efficiency between the other three n- 3 PUFA sources, supplemented as biomass, can be explained by the difference in n- 3 PUFA profile. Higher ratios of ALA+SDA (with a rather inefficient conversion to DHA) to n- 3 LC-PUFA lead to lower n- 3 LC-PUFA enrichment efficiencies. Taken all results together, autotrophic microalgae could serve as n- 3 LC-PUFA source to enrich eggs with these fatty acids. However, the n- 3 PUFA profile and n- 3 PUFA bioaccessibilitiy of the microalgal species should be taken into account. Evaluating the economical aspect of the n- 3 PUFA enriched eggs obtained by supplementation of autotrophic microalgae, it was concluded that the cost is too high due to the high cost price of the autotrophic microalgal biomass compared to the already available n- 3 PUFA sources such as flaxseed, fish oil or heterotrophic microalgal species. Several organizations, microalgal producers and researchers however predict a decrease of the production cost in the near future, which will make it possible to compete with the currently commercially available n- 3 PUFA sources. Next to this, additional benefits could be related to the supplementation of autotrophic microalgae to the diet of the laying hens such as for example the additional {{health benefits}} and higher oxidative stability of the n- 3 LC-PUFA related to the enrichment of carotenoids. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|I. Chemical Changes of Muscle Proteins in Canning (1) The muscle {{proteins}} of some <b>hens,</b> various <b>fishes</b> {{and certain}} animals were prepared as samples {{for the purpose}} of studying what changes take place in the muscle proteins at the time of canning meats under pressure and heating. The materials were sealed in glass-tubes and heated at 130 - 140 ℃ for one hour, and changes of materials were studied. (2) The hydrogen ion concentration of all of the proteins showed a tendency to approach toward the neutral point. (3) About 20 per cent of the protein nitrogen was transformed by heating to peptone, peptide, and amino acid nitrogens. The formation of soluble nitrogen compounds, such as these, is considered to cause a speedy putrefaction of contents of an opened can. (4) As the results of ciementary analyses of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus, {{it was found that the}} quantities of nitrogen and sulphur contained in the proteins generally decreased by heating, and the changes were more marked the higher the values of pH. There was no appreciable change in phosphorus when the solution was neutral, but its amount decreased when solution was acidic or alkaline, and hence the percentage of carbon increased. (5) The quantities of NH_ 3 and H_ 2 S generated by heating were greater in proportion to the values of pH of the solutions. This results explains the fact that, when the tin of cans are bad and the pH of the contents is high, the contents of the can deteriorate more readily and the colour changes to black. (6) As the results of the analyses of the proteins by the Van SYLKE method, the decrease of the total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and cystine nitrogen and the increase of melanine nitrogen were detected especially when the pH value increased. The quantitities of cystine, arginine, histidine and lysine contained in the materials showed a tendency of decrease in all three cases and the same tendencies were very remarkable on cystine at the higher value of pH and on lysine at the lower. (7) Tryptophane by the May-Rose method and the tyrosine by the Falin-Denies method were quantitatively analyzed, and the decrease of these substances by heating were very insignificant. (8) The test for proline was made by the Fisher-Bechner method, but no decomposition by heating was observed. (9) Cysteine and cystine were analyzed quantitatively by the OKUDA-KATAI method, and it was found that a part of any one of these acids aiways changed to the other acid by heating. But the sum of the two always decreased, and the decomposition of both of these acids was remarkable at the higher value of pH, and the decomposition of cysteine was greater than that of cystine. (10) A part of the protein-sulphur changed by heating to hydrogen sulphide, other sulphides, sulphuric acid and soluble organic sulphur, and the quantities of these substances generated were greater at the higher pH of the solutions, as in the case of the decompositions of cysteine and cystine. II. On the Contents of Gases and Metals in Storaged Cans The experiments were chiefly carried out with canned beef of different ages of storage, from 1 to 15 years, were as follows: 1) Among gases contained in cans examined, the quantity of nitrogen was the largest in the majority of the cans, but in some old cans the amount of hydrogen was frequently more than that of nitrogen. 2) The proportion of oxygen as compared to that of nitrogen was much smaller than it is in the air. 3) The content of carbon dioxide in cans was larger than that in the air, but it did not increase appreciably during the storage of the cans. 4) Free ammonia and hydrogen sulphide showed only traces. 5) The concentration of hydrogen ion of the canned meats showed almost no change in storage. 6) The contents of iron and tin in both canned beef and fish were nearly proportional to that of hydrogen in the cans which was produced by corrosion of -can-materials. But in the case of crab meat packed in the cans which are covered inside with lacquer, almost no increase of the contents of iron, tin and hydrogen was observed. 7) Unusual increase of hydrogen gas in some very longstored beef-cans sometimes gave rise to the so called 2 ̆ 2 blown 2 ̆ 2 cans, in which the ends become convex, and arc apparently analogous to the spoiled cans dilated by the pressure at carbon dioxide produced by the action of bacteria upon the contents. III. Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen Gasses Produced at Canning and in Storage In the present case, instead of commercial cans, sealed glass tubes containing a certain meat, tin and iron powders, and solutions of different hydrogen ion concentration were used. 1) The production of carbon dioxide during canning increased a little more, as a rule, in the presence of iron than in the presence of tin alone. And also the longer the time of heating the more was the increase. 2) The production of carbon dioxide during storage, gradually increased in the presence of tin alone, but decreased in the presence of iron. The decrease seems to be due to the fact that carbon dioxide produced by gradual oxidation acts on iron to make iron carbonate and hydrogen. 3) The production of carbon dioxide seems to have some relation with the hydrogen ion concentration of meat-juice and the kind of meats, but the relation with the freshness of the meat is not definite. 4) The production of hydrogen is chiefly due to the presence of iron but only slightly to that of tin. In the presence of iron, the production had an intimate relation with the hydrogen ion concentration of meat-juice, the stronger being the concentration the more the production. The production increased proportionally to the length of time of heating in canning, and to the period of storage of cans. 5) The kind and freshness of meats have more or less influence upon the production of hydrogen from can-material. 6) The quantity of carbon dioxide produced was generally very small as compared to that of hydrogen. IV. Protein, Fat and Nutritive Value of Storaged Canned Meats. The present investigation deals with the chemical changes of the proteins and fats, and also the nutritive value of meats in cans which have endured long storage. The results of the experiments carried out with canned meats of different ages of storage were as follows :- 1) The proteins obtained from fresh and canned beef aged from 2 to 15 years contained nearly equal amounts of nitrogen but differed greatly in amounts of ashes. The ash-content was the more the older the cans. 2) The results of analyses of the proteins by the Van SLYKE method showed no remarkable difference each other. The analogy of the chemical composition of those proteins indicates the similarity of the nutritive value of them. This result agrees with that of feeding experiments performed by us long years ago. 3) Acid value, saponification value, ester value, iodine value, acetyl value, Hehner value, and Reichert-Meissl value were examined in the fats obtained from fresh and canned beef of different ages of storage, but no definite conclusions were obtained, except that the longer the time of storage the higher was the acid value. 4) Carr-Price test for vitamin A was negative in all of the fats exmnined. 5) The nutritive value of the meat powders obtained from canned beef from 2 to 15 years old, and from canned crab from 1 to 5 years old showed only slight differences, when feeding experiments were performed with albino rats. 6) When the great excess of iron and tin in the form of their chlorides was administrated to the rats, the injurious action of iron was greater than that of tin...|$|R

Flaxseed has two major biologically active components; oil in the germ, and phytoestrogen lignans in the hull. Flaxseed oil is very high in omega- 3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid) and these are known to act as inhibitors of prostaglandin pathways and as potent anti-inflammatories. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SGD) in the hull is converted to the anti-estrogenic compounds, enterolactone and enterodiol. Our lab has previously shown that dietary intervention with flaxseed reduces incidence and severity of ovarian cancer. Similarly, flaxseed has also been shown to reduce the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the ovary. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze oviductal polyps from flax-fed and control-fed hens, to investigate the potential for flax-based dietary intervention for the treatment of uterine fibroids, as well as further characterize hen oviductal polyps. Three studies were conducted to assess this objective. First, 1200 6 -month-old White leghorn hens were fed a diet supplemented with 10 % whole flaxseed over a period of 5 years. Every 6 months, 20 hens were sacrificed and oviductal polyps were collected to determine if the flax diet had any effect on polyp size, number, and location. Normal oviductal, muscularis tissue and polyps were collected for histological analysis and for RNA. The second study consisted of six treatment groups 15 % whole flax seed, 10 % defatted flax meal (DFM), 5 % flax oil (FXO), 5 % corn oil, 5 % Stearidonic Acid (SDA) oil, and 5 % soy oil with 30 1. 5 year old hens in each group, fed for 4 months. Hens were then sacrificed, and polyps were collected and fixed for histological analysis. A long-term component study where 3 year old hen were fed diets supplemented with 15 % whole flaxseed, 10 % defatted flax meal, 5 % flax oil, 5 % fish oil, and 5 % corn oil for a one year period. Power analysis was conducted regarding ovarian cancer to determine the number of hens per group. It was determined 161 hens in control, 161 hens in DFM, 161 hens in flax oil, 161 hens in whole flax, 175 <b>hens</b> in <b>fish</b> oil, and 175 hens in the corn oil group. After one year, polyps were counted and collected for various tissue analyses. In the 5 year study, overall polyp incidence increased between the 3 and 3. 5 year time points, with no difference between groups. Average polyp area per bird and largest polyp per bird significantly increased from 2. 5 year old birds versus to 3. 5 and 4 year old birds with no difference in diet groups. Average polyp number per bird had no significant difference between the time points. Incidence, average polyp number per bird, largest polyp per bird, and average polyp volume per bird in the one-year long-term component study showed no difference between diets. Uterine fibroid estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL- 2), transforming growth factor β 3 (TGF-β 3), collagen type 1 (COL 1 A 1) and collagen type 3 (COL 3 A 1) were then analyzed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in both oviductal polyps and muscularis oviduct. In the 5 year long-term study, ERα mRNA expression decreased, while PR, BCL- 2, COL 1 A 1, and COL 3 A 1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in hen oviductal polyps. In the one year long-term study ERα mRNA in oviductal polyps was decreased in all groups (DFM, FXO, fish oil, corn oil) except whole flax fed hens. Progesterone receptor mRNA expression was increased in the muscularis oviduct of only corn fed hens, while no change was seen in oviductal polyp. BCL- 2 mRNA expression was decreased in all treatment groups in muscularis oviduct and increased in oviductal polyps from DFM supplemented birds. TGF-β 3 mRNA expression was significantly increased in whole flax fed and fish oil birds in muscularis oviduct. In oviductal polyps, TGF-β 3 was increased in whole flax, flax oil, fish oil, and corn oil but none were significant. COL 1 A 1 and COL 3 A 1 demonstrated a similar pattern and showed minimal change between diet groups as well as muscularis oviduct and oviductal polyps. Inflammatory pathway enzymes COX- 1 and COX- 2 were then analyzed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. In the 5 year long-term study, no change was seen in COX- 1, but COX- 2 mRNA increased in whole flax fed oviductal polyps. Immunohistochemical sections of COX- 1 had singular punctate staining in DFM and flax oil compared to other diets. COX- 2 expression showed decreased immunohistochemical staining intensity in the flax oil fed hens, but not in any other group. In the one year long-term component study, COX- 1 mRNA expression had no change in muscularis oviduct and oviductal polyps. COX- 2 mRNA decreased in muscularis muscle tissue of flax oil and <b>fish</b> oil treated <b>hens,</b> but not in oviductal polyps. The steroidogenic capability of oviductal polyps was then analyzed by examining mRNA and protein expression. In the 5 year study steroidogenic pathway components (StAR, 3 βHSD, CYP 17, and CYP 19 showed no mRNA expression in smooth muscle oviduct. In oviductal polyps StAR and CYP 17 mRNA expression increased, but 3 βHSD and CYP 19 expression decreased with the flaxseed diet. 3 βHSD protein expression was then shown immunohistochemically to shift its expression to a more punctate, cytoplasmic form in defatted flax meal fed hens. In the one year long-term component study, steroidogenic pathway components were found in the muscularis oviduct. mRNA expression of StAR decreased in flax oil and fish oil of muscularis oviduct, but increased in oviductal polyps from flax oil hens. 3 βHSD mRNA expression increased in muscularis oviduct of corn oil fed hens, however expression was decreased in flax oil and fish oil groups. In oviductal polyps 3 βHSD mRNA was decreased in all groups. CYP 17 mRNA was decreased in muscularis oviduct of flax oil and fish oil fed birds, but increased in DFM hens. Oviductal polyp CYP 17 mRNA expression increased in flax oil, flax oil and corn oil diets but expression was ameliorated in whole flax hens. CYP 19 mRNA expression in muscularis oviduct significantly decreased in flax oil and <b>fish</b> oil fed <b>hens.</b> In oviductal polyps CYP 19 mRNA expression was decreased in DFM, whole flax, and <b>fish</b> oil <b>hens.</b> CYP 19 expression was increased in corn fed birds in muscularis oviduct and oviductal polyps. Immunohistochemical protein expression of 3 βHSD and aromatase (CYP 19) did not change between diet groups. This is the first demonstration of the steroidogenic capability of oviductal polyps. This study proposes supplementation of whole flaxseed as a mechanism of dietary intervention for uterine fibroids. As stated above, flaxseed may be working through the estrogen or inflammatory pathways to reduce overall incidence of oviductal polyps. The data suggests that flaxseed may not act on the growth of leiomyomas, but perhaps their initiation. Progesterone has been shown to upregulate important leiomyoma factors, such as BCL- 2 and TGF-β 3, while COX- 2 upregulation has been previously shown to increase collagen deposition and TGF-β 3 expression. The increases in the proinflammatory environment of the oviduct could initiate the upregulation of downstream targets of progesterone and COX- 2. Similarly, an increase in PGE 2 synthesis has been shown to induce transcription of steroidogenic pathways and could explain expression in oviductal polyps. Further studies need to be conducted to elucidate the role of PGE 2 in oviductal polyps. The mechanisms of flaxseed and its components must also be further teased apart to elucidate their true impact and determine the exact action in oviductal polyps...|$|R
