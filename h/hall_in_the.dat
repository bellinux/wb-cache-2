5|$|The south, {{east and}} west ranges of third {{quadrangle}} contain elements of St Mary Hall, which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; {{less than a decade}} later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building.

5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E

5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States to earn that distinction. Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, and solar panels to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|Following an {{application}} by the British colony of Southern Rhodesia to the International Olympic Committee, {{the country was}} allowed to compete as an independent nation for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This {{was one of two}} British Crown colonies that were permitted to participate independently that year, the other being Malta. Southern Rhodesia, as it was known at the time, competed under the name of Rhodesia. Two athletes from Southern Rhodesia were selected to compete in the 1928 games, both in boxing; Cecil Bissett in the lightweight and Leonard <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> welterweight weight division. This was the least number of athletes sent to a Summer Olympics by Rhodesia, and from the 1980 Summer Olympics as Zimbabwe.|$|E

5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 {{an ornate}} range was erected by St Mary <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
