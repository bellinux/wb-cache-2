5|$|The <b>giraffe</b> genome {{is around}} 2.9 billion base pairs in length {{compared}} to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in <b>giraffe</b> and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The divergence of <b>giraffe</b> and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the <b>giraffe</b> appear {{to be responsible for}} the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{survey is}} the most common method of {{monitoring}} <b>giraffe</b> population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and should be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. In 2010, giraffes were assessed as Least Concern from a conservation perspective by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the 2016 assessment categorized giraffes as Vulnerable. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Swaziland. Two subspecies, the West African <b>giraffe</b> and the Rothschild <b>giraffe,</b> have been classified as Endangered, as wild populations of each of them number in the hundreds. In 1997, Jonathan Kingdon suggested that the Nubian <b>giraffe</b> was the most threatened of all giraffes; , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of <b>giraffe</b> populations in southern Africa. <b>Giraffe</b> Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The <b>giraffe</b> is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the <b>giraffe</b> first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a <b>giraffe</b> to salivate while feeding. The <b>giraffe</b> requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a <b>giraffe</b> drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous <b>Giraffe</b> on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The <b>Giraffe</b> was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the <b>Giraffe</b> has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of <b>giraffe</b> with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African <b>giraffe.</b> The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai <b>giraffe</b> was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between <b>giraffes</b> (Giraffa camelopardalis) and Acacia nigrescens in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to determine whether these tall ungulates may be providing a pollination service for the trees, or are simply flower predators. We quantified florivory and subsequent fruit set in the presence and absence of <b>giraffes.</b> Acacia nigrescens flowers are clearly a substantial dietary component for <b>giraffes.</b> Although A. nigrescens flowers contain almost three times as much condensed tannin as leaves, <b>giraffes</b> consume large quantities of flowers ([similar] 85 % of flowers within reach), resulting in distinct browse lines on the trees. This substantial florivory is detrimental to the overall fecundity of A. nigrescens, with significantly reduced fruit set at heights on trees that are accessible to <b>giraffes.</b> Fruit set increased above the reach of <b>giraffes,</b> suggesting successful pollination by insects. <b>Giraffes</b> were effectively flower predators of A. nigrescens in the season we examined...|$|R
50|$|Kouré is {{best known}} for West African <b>giraffes</b> (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), an endemic {{subspecies}} of West Africa.The population of <b>giraffes</b> in Niger reached a low of 50 animals 1984, but according to the Association to Safeguard <b>Giraffes</b> in Niger (ASGN) there are now 170 of them. ASGN and its partners have assisted the local community with bore holes, cereal banks, grain mills, seeds and fertilizer to encourage them to protect the <b>giraffes,</b> which can be destructive to crops.However, the population of <b>giraffes</b> is threatened by loss of the tiger bush habitat, which is gradually being cleared for agriculture.|$|R
5|$|The <b>giraffe</b> {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans, who {{believed}} that it was an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard and called it camelopardalis. The <b>giraffe</b> was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the <b>giraffe</b> for its peculiar appearance.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the <b>giraffe.</b> It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the <b>giraffe.</b> While both sexes possess horns in the <b>giraffe,</b> only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the <b>giraffe</b> and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in 2016 found that the common ancestor of <b>giraffe</b> and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{believed}} the <b>giraffe's</b> long neck was an [...] "acquired characteristic", developed as generations of ancestral <b>giraffes</b> strove {{to reach the}} leaves of tall trees. This theory was eventually rejected, and scientists now believe the <b>giraffe's</b> neck arose through Darwinian natural selection—that ancestral <b>giraffes</b> with long necks thereby had a competitive feeding advantage (competing browsers hypothesis) that better enabled them to survive and reproduce to pass on their genes.|$|R
50|$|The South African <b>giraffes</b> are {{not very}} common in captivity. As of 2010, there are around 45 <b>giraffes</b> {{breeding}} in zoos.|$|R
5|$|Some parasites feed on <b>giraffes.</b> They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on <b>giraffes</b> are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. <b>Giraffes</b> may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. <b>Giraffes</b> host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. <b>Giraffes</b> can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of <b>giraffes</b> show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|R
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a <b>giraffe,</b> in the left panel. The <b>giraffe</b> has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E

5|$|Dio and Martial record some of {{the animals}} that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt {{involving}} cranes and another involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals {{may have been used}} but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games. Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar had brought a single <b>giraffe</b> to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici <b>giraffe</b> in 1486, although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, {{there is no mention of}} hippopotami at Titus' games.|$|E
5|$|<b>Giraffe</b> groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable <b>giraffe</b> groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of <b>giraffe</b> calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on <b>giraffe</b> calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E

5|$|The {{elongation}} of {{the neck}} appears to have started early in the <b>giraffe</b> lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15mya or 18–14.3mya and whose deposits {{have been found in}} Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small <b>giraffe,</b> and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.|$|E
