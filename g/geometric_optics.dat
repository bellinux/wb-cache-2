25|$|Most optical {{phenomena}} can {{be accounted}} for using the classical electromagnetic description of light. Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, <b>geometric</b> <b>optics,</b> treats light {{as a collection of}} rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot {{be accounted for}} in <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{mechanics}} is {{the same}} extreme high frequency approximation as <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> It is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with rest mass. These have more momentum and therefore shorter De Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same kinetic energies.|$|E
50|$|The eikonal {{equation}} (from German Eikonal, which is from Greek εἰκών, image) is a non-linear partial differential equation encountered in problems of wave propagation, when the wave equation is approximated using the WKB theory. It is derivable from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics, {{and provides a}} link between physical (wave) <b>optics</b> and <b>geometric</b> (ray) <b>optics.</b>|$|R

40|$|Restricted Access. A general {{framework}} for analysing {{the evolution of}} the state of a light beam travelling along an arbitrary space curve and undergoing arbitrary polarization changes is described. It uses a new way of treating reflections and provides a unified description of several experiments on <b>geometric</b> phases in <b>optics</b> reported recently...|$|R
25|$|If {{wavelength}} {{is smaller}} than the textured size, the reflection reduction can be explained {{with the help of}} the <b>geometric</b> <b>optics</b> approximation: rays should be reflected many times before they are sent back toward the source. In this case the reflection can be calculated using ray tracing.|$|E
25|$|Newton, {{and most}} of his contemporaries, with the notable {{exception}} of Huygens, worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena, including light, in the form of <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> Even when discovering the so-called Newton's rings (a wave interference phenomenon) he maintained his own corpuscular theory of light.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of <b>geometric</b> <b>optics,</b> if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian beam {{propagation}} is {{a simple}} paraxial physical optics model for the propagation of coherent radiation such as laser beams. This technique partially accounts for diffraction, allowing accurate calculations of {{the rate at which}} a laser beam expands with distance, and the minimum size to which the beam can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between <b>geometric</b> and physical <b>optics.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years several manifestations of <b>geometric</b> phase in <b>optics</b> have been discovered. The most studied manifestations are spin {{redirection}} phase and Pancharatnam phase. A new phase on the transformations of optical beam modes has begun to be studied. This article reviews the principles of these phases and discusses the applications that have been proposed and reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Polynomial {{functions}} of the classical phase variables p 2, p×q, and q 2, are used in higher-order perturbation expansions in various fields of physics, including <b>geometric</b> aberration <b>optics</b> of axially-symmetric lens and mirror systems. These polynomials participate in operations such as linear combination, multiplication, Poisson brackets, and a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff compounding that corresponds to concatenation of optical elements. We are interested in handling the polynomials through structures and in bases where the above operations are as short as possible. The monomial basis is one obvious choice that performs efficiently under multiplication. For Poisson brackets and aberration-group products however, the symplectic basis that uses solid spherical, harmonics in three variables is {{shown to be a}} better choice. In the last operation, for seventh aberration order, we halve the computation complexity in the symplectic basis...|$|R
25|$|Scattering and {{absorption}} {{are major}} {{causes of the}} attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies {{as a function of}} the ratio of the particle diameter of the wavelength of the radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, Rayleigh scattering occurs. In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios, scattering varies in a complex fashion, described for spherical particles by the Mie theory; the laws of <b>geometric</b> <b>optics</b> begin to apply at a ratio of the order of 10.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{principle}} of Huygens {{is that the}} speed of light is finite, a point which had been the subject of an experimental demonstration by Olaus Roemer (1679 at the Paris Observatory), but which Huygens is presumed to have believed already. The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> It covers little of what would now be termed physical optics. It deals with wave fronts and their normal rays, with propagation conceived by means of spherical waves emitted along the wave front (see also Huygens–Fresnel principle). It was justified as an ether theory, involving transmission via perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century Johannes Kepler {{expanded}} on <b>geometric</b> <b>optics</b> in his writings, covering lenses, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, {{the principles of}} pinhole cameras, inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, and the optical explanations of astronomical phenomena such as lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax. He was also able to correctly deduce {{the role of the}} retina as the actual organ that recorded images, finally being able to scientifically quantify the effects of different types of lenses that spectacle makers had been observing over the previous 300 years. After the invention of the telescope Kepler set out the theoretical basis on how they worked and described an improved version, known as the Keplerian telescope, using two convex lenses to produce higher magnification.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports on}} the {{intriguing}} features of vector vortex bearing beams are analyzed using <b>geometric</b> phases in <b>optics.</b> It is argued that the spin redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition. Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent with our conjecture. Comment: No figure...|$|R
40|$|Conventional optics (e. g. lenses or mirrors) manipulates {{the phase}} via optical path {{difference}} by controlling thickness or refractive index of material. Recently, a promising type of optics emerged which exploits geometric phase shift, when a lightwave is transformed by parameter other than optical path difference, e. g. polarization. Here, wavefront is modified by introducing spatially varying anisotropy {{and is a}} result of Panchatraman-Berry phase [1]. Theoretically any phase pattern can be achieved solely by means of geometric phase with efficiencies reaching 100 % [2]. This allows continuous optical phase shifts and without phase resets, in stark contrast to conventional elements, wherein phase profiles are encoded as discrete optical path variations in refractive index or thickness, limiting performance. The <b>geometric</b> phase <b>optics</b> is a promising alternative for controlling and manipulating light, but it stumbles on the lack of adequate fabrication technology...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{branches}} of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms; {{two of the}} most accurate being general relativity and relativistic statistical mechanics. <b>Geometric</b> <b>optics</b> is an approximation to the quantum theory of light, and does not have a superior [...] "classical" [...] form.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Geometric</b> <b>optics</b> {{is often}} {{simplified}} {{by making the}} paraxial approximation, or [...] "small angle approximation". The mathematical behaviour then becomes linear, allowing optical components and systems to be described by simple matrices. This leads to the techniques of Gaussian optics and paraxial ray tracing, which are used to find basic properties of optical systems, such as approximate image and object positions and magnifications.|$|E
2500|$|In {{physical}} optics, {{light is}} considered to propagate as a wave. This model predicts phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which are not explained by <b>geometric</b> <b>optics.</b> The speed of light waves in air is approximately 3.0×108m/s (exactly 299,792,458m/s in vacuum). The wavelength of visible light waves varies between 400 and 700nm, but the term [...] "light" [...] is also often applied to infrared (0.7–300μm) and ultraviolet radiation (10–400nm).|$|E
50|$|<b>Geometric</b> distortions by <b>optics</b> and {{perspective}} must be compensated by a calibration of the measuring equipment, using special calibration patterns and surfaces. A mathematical model {{is used for}} describing the imaging properties of projector and cameras. Essentially based on the simple geometric properties of a pinhole camera, the model also has {{to take into account}} the geometric distortions and optical aberration of projector and camera lenses. The parameters of the camera as well as its orientation in space can be determined by a series of calibration measurements, using photogrammetric bundle adjustment.|$|R
40|$|Geometric phase may enable {{inherently}} fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, due {{to potential}} decoherence effects, {{it is important}} to understand how such phases arise for mixed input states. We report the first experiment to measure mixed-state <b>geometric</b> phases in <b>optics,</b> using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and polarization mixed states that are produced in two different ways: decohering pure states with birefringent elements; and producing a nonmaximally entangled state of two photons and tracing over one of them, a form of remote state preparation.

[...] Hence, the electromagnetic [...] "ray" [...] is bent away from the normal rather than toward the normal as would be indicated when the refractive index is greater than unity.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a refractive radiative transfer equation to the graphics com-munity for the physically based rendering of participating media {{that have a}} spatially varying index of refraction. We review principles of <b>geometric</b> nonlinear <b>optics</b> that are crucial to discuss a more generic light transport equation. In particular, we present an optical model that has an integral form suitable for rendering. We show rigorously that the continuous bending of light rays leads to a nonlinear scaling of radiance. To obtain physically correct results, we build {{on the concept of}} basic radiance—known from discontinuous refraction—to conserve energy in such complex media. Fur-thermore, the generic model accounts for the reduction in the speed of light due to the index of refraction to render transient effects like the propa-gation of light echoes. We solve the refractive volume rendering equation by extending photon mapping with transient light transport in a refractive, participating medium. We demonstrate the impact of our approach on the correctness of rendered images of media that are dominated by spatiall...|$|R
40|$|The {{tools of}} presymplectic {{geometry}} {{are used to}} study light rays trajectories in anisotropic media. The usefulness of the Lie [...] Hamilton optics in many different problems as ray tracing for ray design and computation of aberrations suggests the study of what happens for anisotropic media, because of the recent interest {{in the use of}} anisotropic optical material. This motivated a very recent paper [1] where the Hamiltonian formulation of <b>geometric</b> anisotropic <b>optics</b> was studied. The theory was reexamined in [2]. The basic principle of the theory is the celebrated Fermat's principle of least time (or extremal time if reflection is also allowed). In other words, light rays connecting points A and B are lines in the space {{in such a way that}} they satisfy the following variational condition: ffi Z B A n ds = 0 : (1) The refractive index of the medium is given by the quotient n = c v, and then physics tell us that n ? 1.

40|$|Recently the {{physical}} mechanism for <b>geometric</b> phase in <b>optics</b> has been elucidated {{in terms of}} the angular momentum holonomy proposed in 1992. Aharonov and Kaufherr (PRL, 92, 070404, 2004) revisit the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and propose non-local exchange of a conserved, gauge invariant quantity that changes the modular momentum of the particle that is responsible for the AB phase shift. We suggest that the net angular momentum shifts proposed for GP may be analogous to the shift in the modulus momentum for the AB effect. At a single photon or electron level such non-trivial, geometric effects seem to hint at a new physics. Comment: Short note prior to work on frequency shift...|$|R

40|$|In situ {{observations}} of the sizes, shapes, and phases of Arctic clouds were obtained during the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment (FIRE) Arctic Clouds Experiment (ACE). These particle distributions were then combined with a library of single-scattering properties, calculated using Mie theory and improved <b>geometric</b> ray <b>optics,</b> to determine the corresponding single-scattering properties (single-scattering albedo v 0, phase function, and asymmetry parameter g) at solar wavelengths. During FIRE-ACE, mixed-phase clouds, where both water and ice were detected in 30 s of flight track, corresponding to 3. 0 -km horizontal extent, were observed in 33 % of clouds. Because supercooled water drops generally dominate mass contents of these mixed-phase clouds, there is {{no statistically significant difference}} in the distributions of single-scattering prop-erties of mixed-phase clouds compared to liquid-phase clouds, whereas those of ice crystals differ significantly.
