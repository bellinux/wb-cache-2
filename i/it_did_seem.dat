500|$|Peter Thompson, {{the head}} of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, {{described}} the situation {{on the night of the}} coup as [...] "a very large presence of the military in the streets. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> quite coordinated last night in terms of how the roads were shut off...Today the streets are very calm, the city is much quieter than it normally would be. People are staying home. I do know that the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official." [...] There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ialá Embaló.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most EU states, {{which usually}} operate {{parliamentary}} systems, {{there is a}} separation of powers between the executive and legislative which makes the European Parliament more akin to the United States Congress than an EU state legislature. The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council {{on the basis of}} the European elections to Parliament. That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority) who [...] "elect" [...] the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament. In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament. That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public—who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.|$|E

"The Government Attorney ... {{yesterday}} afternoon placed {{in my hands}} the printed evidence [...]. and to my mind <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> as though that grant, upon which Reavis reliesit seems to me, from a cursory examination ... {{that it is a}} fabrication, and as such, if such {{it turns out to be}} ... I want it distinctly understood by the Court and by the Government Attorney, that we have had nothing to do with it. [...] We wash our hands from all of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Swervedriver {{would spend}} the rest of the year touring {{extensively}} for the album. The band performed a promo gig opening for Hum on 26 February 1998 at Irving Plaza in New York and kicked off a North American stint in late May with acts such as Sianspheric, The Dandy Warhols, and Beck. The tour swung to the UK at the end of July, and discussions started within the band about a break: [...] "it cropped up – 'Is this fun? Are we having fun doing this?' I guess we kind of weren’t," [...] spoke Franklin in a 2011 interview. They ultimately decided to keep going until the end of the year, honoring their touring commitments, and then according to Franklin, [...] "take a bit of a time out... although <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> like the end, to me." [...] The group returned to the US to headline a nine-show club tour in the Northeast; they immediately followed with a wide-ranging Australian tour opening for Powderfinger, with their last show taking place at Bootleg Brewery in Margaret River near Perth on 13 December 1998.|$|E
