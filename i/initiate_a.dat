5|$|In {{order to}} <b>initiate</b> <b>a</b> turn and the {{necessary}} lean {{in the direction}} of that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary to <b>initiate</b> <b>a</b> rapid turn.|$|E
