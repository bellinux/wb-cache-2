Anna Karoline was chosen because she was in a relatively original condition and she is the only Nordlandsjekt in such condition that has been preserved. As of 2014 <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> other jekts in Norway. It is the newly built copy of the jekt Brødrene and the jekt Pauline of Steinkjer, the latter is so much repaired and rebuilt that she is far from her original condition. Both are carvel built and sailing, contrary to Anna Karoline which is on land. The Holvikejekta located at Sandane in Western Norway is also ashore and as Anna Karoline she is also clinker built.|$|E
