40|$|Abstract. <b>Glass</b> dust <b>waste</b> creates chronic {{environmental}} problems, mainly {{due to the}} inconsistency of <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> streams. Glass {{is widely}} used in our lives through manufactured products such as sheet glass, bottles, glassware, and vacuum tubing. Glass is an ideal material for recycling. The use of recycled glass helps in energy saving. The increasing awareness of glass recycling speeds up inspections {{on the use of}} <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> with different forms in various fields. One of its significant contributions is to the construction field where the <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> was reused for concrete production. The properties of concretes containing <b>glass</b> dust <b>waste</b> as fine aggregate were investigated in this study. <b>Glass</b> dust <b>waste</b> was used as a partial replacement for sand at 10 %, 20 % and 50 % of concrete mixes.

The compressive strength of specimens with 10 % <b>glass</b> dust <b>waste</b> content were 32. 9373 MPa, higher than the concrete control specimen at 28 days.

Special concrete made with waste material is becoming popular in a construction site. This is because the special concrete is selected due to quality, integrity, economic factor and environmental factor. The <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> is selected as an additional material to provide a good in compressive strength value. The compressive strength is the importance of mechanical properties of concrete and typically the concrete is sustained and stiffed in compression load. The significant issue to utilize the <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> from the automotive windscreen is to improve the strength of concrete. The <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> is crushed to become 5 mm size and recognised as crushed <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> that be used in concrete as additional material.

There are four mixes of concrete that contained of crushed <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> with percentage of 2 %, 4 %, 6 % and 8 % and one control mix with 0 % of crushed <b>waste</b> <b>glass.</b> As the result, crushed <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> with an additional 4 % in concrete is reported having a higher value of compressive strength in early and mature stage.

40|$|Fast {{increasing}} {{of generation}} and release of undesirable pollutants by the industrialization raise {{concerns about the}} environmental consequences of waste disposal. Among these waste materials, non-recycled <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> constitutes one of the majority wastes produced in many European countries and sets a major environmental issue. Although glass could be recycled into the packaging stream without significantly changing its chemical and physical properties, {{there is still a}} significant proportion, which does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass, to be sent to landfill. <b>Waste</b> <b>glass</b> is not a biodegradable material, which made landfilling <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> become a highly unsustainable option. To find a better solution to reduce the environmental issues caused by disposal of <b>waste</b> <b>glass,</b> alkaline activation technology is introduced to use <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> into alkali activated materials (AAMs) to produce construction materials. <b>Waste</b> <b>glass</b> is believed to have the potential to serve as precursor material in geopolymer production because of abundant amount of amorphous silica in a structure that does not reflect long range order. However, limited research has been conducted on <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> as precursor material in AAMs, neither is the utilization of <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> as replacement for binder precursor like fly ash. Currently, the feasibility of using <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> in geopolymer systems is still largely unknown.

The main focus of this research is on the reactivity of <b>waste</b> <b>glass</b> powder and its influence on the microstructure development and gel formation, with correlation with mechanical strength. It has been found that: <b>Waste</b> <b>glass</b> powder, which is dominantly in irregular polygonal shape, has much finer particles size distribution and larger specific surface area compared with fly ash and slag.
