25|$|Despite <b>flucloxacillin</b> being {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance {{to it and}} other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin.

25|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems.

25|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> (INN) or floxacillin (USAN) is a narrow-spectrum {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is used {{to treat}} infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria. Unlike other penicillins, <b>flucloxacillin</b> has activity against beta-lactamase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus as it is beta-lactamase stable. However, it is ineffective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It {{is very similar to}} dicloxacillin; they are considered interchangeable. While no longer used in the United States, <b>Flucloxacillin</b> is supplied under a variety of trade names in other countries, including Floxapen (Beecham, now GSK), Flopen (CSL), Staphylex (Alphapharm), Softapen (Rephco Pharmaceuticals Limited), Flubex (Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Bangladesh), and Flupen (for state use only in South Africa).|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> {{can also}} be used to prevent infections during major {{surgical}} procedures, particularly in heart or orthopedic surgery.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of <b>flucloxacillin</b> include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with <b>flucloxacillin</b> therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> is more acid-stable {{than many}} other {{penicillins}} and can be given orally, in addition to parenteral routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than benzylpenicillin against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> {{has similar}} pharmacokinetics, {{antibacterial}} activity, and indications to dicloxacillin, {{and the two}} agents are considered interchangeable. It {{is reported to have}} higher, though rare, incidence of severe hepatic adverse effects than dicloxacillin, but a lower incidence of renal adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, <b>Flucloxacillin</b> has good {{activity}} against non-β-lactamase-producing bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes. Due to this widespread belief, empirical therapy for significant cellulitis often involves dual-therapy to cover both staphylococci and streptococci, however {{this has not}} shown to be of clinical benefit.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of β-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam {{ring of the}} penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and <b>flucloxacillin,</b> are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.|$|E
25|$|More {{severe cases}} require oral antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin, <b>flucloxacillin,</b> or erythromycin. Alternatively, {{amoxicillin}} combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) {{and many others}} may {{also be used as}} an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with MRSA include doxycycline, clindamycin, and SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.|$|E
25|$|In {{those cases}} of abscess which do require {{antibiotic}} treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria {{is a common}} cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as <b>flucloxacillin</b> or dicloxacillin is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess {{is not enough to}} address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Specific approved indications include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Like other β-lactam antibiotics, <b>flucloxacillin</b> [...] acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the synthesis}} of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains {{that make up a}} major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flucloxacillin</b> is {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamase (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The {{presence of the}} isoxazolyl group on the side chain of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase [...] resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side chain steric hindrance. Thus, {{it is able to}} bind to penicillin-binding proteins and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamases.|$|E
2500|$|Today, S. aureus {{has become}} {{resistant}} to many commonly used antibiotics. [...] In the UK, only 2% of all S. aureus isolates {{are sensitive to}} penicillin, with a similar picture {{in the rest of}} the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and <b>flucloxacillin)</b> were developed to treat penicillin-resistant S. aureus, and are still used as first-line treatment. [...] Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of MRSA was reported in England.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} level of {{resistance}} to penicillins and because of the potential for MRSA to develop resistance to vancomycin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published [...] for the appropriate use of vancomycin. In situations where the incidence of MRSA infections is known to be high, the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide antibiotic until the identity of the infecting organism is known. [...] After the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillin-susceptible strain of S. aureus, treatment can be changed to <b>flucloxacillin</b> or even penicillin], as appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for S. aureus infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some Penicillium fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of β-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme’s functionality and {{it can no longer}} catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or <b>flucloxacillin,</b> both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin). [...] Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys. [...] The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity.|$|E
