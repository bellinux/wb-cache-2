40|$|Aiming at the {{performance}} defect of tubular pump with fixed <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> a design scheme of tubular pump with adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> is proposed, {{so that the}} inlet setting angle of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> can be flexibly adjusted to coordinate with the operation conditions of pump, to ensure the inlet setting angle of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> changing with the outlet flow angle of the impeller. The three-dimensional time-averaged incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are adopted to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a tubular pump with fixed and adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively. Computed results indicate that with the design of adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and at off-design flow rates the flow conditions inside the diffuser of tubular pump can be improved effectively, and its hydraulic losses can be reduced.

At this location a saw, which had its own source of electricity supply, operated {{in the first half of}} previous century. Since then there are two Francis turbines still built in the complex, which have been reconstructed for the needs of the small hydropower plants.

40|$|Variable inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (VIGV) is used {{to control}} the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. Due to the tip clearance of the guide vanes and the defect of the traditional <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas. Two kinds of inlet flow channels were proposed to eliminate the influence of tip clearance. These structures were numerically investigated at different setting angles.

40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the guide vanes. The guide vanes are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes. It is assumed that it is the sharp trailing edge of the guide vanes that causes turbulence over the vanes in pump mode, thus making the guide vanes move about within the play of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system. It is suggested that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system is replaced with an RPT <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system for further testing in pump mode.
