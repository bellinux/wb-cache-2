Waveguide magic tee is {{an important element in}} microwave and millimeter wave applications. HFSS is a high-performance full-wave electromagnetic (EM) field simulator for arbitrary 3 D volumetric passive device modeling. In this paper HFSS simulation software has been used to design X band Magic Tee which shows the isolation between port 1 and port 4 below- 60 dB and phase of transmission coefficient between collinear arms is 180 deg. Simulation results also show the field analysis in collinear arm, Harm and E arm...|$|E
40|$|Transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) {{under general}} anesthesia {{has become a}} routine procedure as guidance in implanting Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) for closing secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) together with fluoroscopy in cardiac catheterization laboratory. To simplify the procedure and reduce the cost, recently we used transthoracal echocardiography (TTE) in guiding the ASO implantation. Aim {{of this study is}} to evaluate accuracy and performance of ASO procedure guided by TTE compared to ASO procedure <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE.</b> This is a comparative study. Ninety-one patients with ASDs referred for transcatheter closure with ASO in National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita Hospital Jakarta were reviewed. In the 22 patients, TTE were used as guidance instead of TEE. Patients selection were performed in the outpatient clinic by TEE. The stretched diameter was measured by TEE or TTE and fluoroscopy. Patients were divided into two groups, TEE group consisted of procedures <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE,</b> and TTE group guided by TTE. From 91 patients, 83 can be evaluated. It consisted of 61 patients in TEE group and 22 in TTE group. Measurement of defects sizes with TTE and TEE have a high correlation with fluoroscopic measurements (r= 0. 837 and r= 0. 853, respectively). There were no significant differences between the accuracy of TTE and TEE sizes measurement (p= 0. 085) compared to fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy time in ASO procedures <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE</b> was significantly longer than those guided by TTE (33. 2 ± 21. 3 min vs. 22. 8 ± 19. 3 min, P= 0. 014). There was also no significant differences in the failure of devices implantation between TEE and TTE guidance. All patients were in good condition at follow-up. ASO procedures guided by TTE have similar accuracy to those <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE,</b> with shorter fluoroscopy time. TTE guidance also has no difference in failure rate compared to TEE guidance.

40|$|Abstract- Rheumatic {{mitral valve}} {{stenosis}} {{is the most}} common form of organic heart disease encountered during pregnancy and continues to cause maternal and fetal mortality. Medically refractory congestive heart failure due to mitral stenosis is a clinical challenge and its optimal management remains controversial. On the other hand due to hazard of x-ray to mother and fetus, there are some limitations for perceutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy (PBMV) with fluoroscopy. Therefore, we performed PBMV with the guide of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Inoue method in 18 pregnant women with NYHA class 3 or 4 due to mitral stenosis during pregnancy. The average procedure time was 29. 9 (20 - 40) min and the average fluoroscopy time was 51. 7 (28 - 101) seconds. The average NYHA class decreased from 3. 11 to 1. 33. There was no maternal or fetal complication or mortality and no premature delivery occurred. Overall risk to fetus was lower than previous reports of surgical commisurotomy performed during pregnancy. PBMV can be performed safely during pregnancy with the <b>guide</b> of <b>TEE</b> and is effective in reliving symptoms of severe congestive heart failure. It offers an effective alternative for the pregnant patients with severe mitral stenosis when congestive heart failure is not controlled by conventional medical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Left atrial {{catheterization}} through transseptal puncture {{is frequently}} performed in cardiac catheterization procedures. Appropriate transseptal puncture {{is critical to}} achieve procedural success. Aims: The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the feasibility of selective transseptal punctures, using a modified radiofrequency (RF) transseptal needle and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), in different types of procedures that require specific sites of left atrial catheterization. Setting and Design: This was an observational trial in a cardiac catheterization laboratory of a teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing different percutaneous procedures requiring atrial transseptal puncture such as atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, and mitral valve repair were included in the study. All procedures were <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE</b> and an RF transseptal needle targeting a specific region of the septum to perform the puncture. Statistical Analysis: The statistical analysis was descriptive only. Results: RF-assisted transseptal punctures were performed in six consecutive patients who underwent AF ablation (two patients), LAA closure (two patients), and mitral valve repair (two patients). In all patients, transseptal punctures were performed successfully at the desired site. No adverse events or complications were observed. Conclusions: Selective transseptal puncture, using TEE and an RF needle, is a feasible technique {{that can be used in}} multiple approaches requiring a precise site of access for left atrial catheterization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe primary {{objective}} was to evaluate the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) -guided cardioversion to prevent thromboembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and effective anticoagulation (International Normalized Ratio of 2 or 3) at least three weeks before cardioversion. BackgroundTransesophageal echocardiography has been proposed {{as a method of}} screening patients for left atrial thrombi before direct-current cardioversion of AF. The usefulness of TEE as a screening tool has always been evaluated in patients without long-term anticoagulation before cardioversion. MethodsThis prospective, single-center, observational study, performed on an intention-to-cardiovert basis, comprised 1, 076 consecutive, unselected patients with AF. The initial two years were designed to be the control phase, during which the conventional approach was used. After that, cardioversion <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE</b> was performed in consecutive patients. ResultsThe prevalence of left atrial thrombi was 7. 7 % in patients with persistent AF and effective anticoagulation. During the first four weeks after electrical cardioversion, six thromboembolic complications were observed in patients in whom the TEE-guided approach was employed (6 [0. 8 %] of 719 patients), compared with three thromboembolic complications in patients in whom the conventional approach was used (3 [0. 8 %] of 357 patients). None of the patients in whom electrical cardioversion was not performed experienced an embolic event. ConclusionsThere were no differences in the rate of embolic events between the two treatment groups. In patients with AF and effective anticoagulation, TEE-guided electrical cardioversion does not reduce the embolic risk. However, TEE revealed left atrial thrombi in 7. 7 % of patients with AF and effective anticoagulation, before direct-current cardioversion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFunctional tricuspid regurge (FTR) is an {{important}} dilemma in cardiac surgery, and tricuspid annular dilation is a reliable indicator {{of the degree of}} FTR. Many methods are available for repair: Ring repair is believed to be more durable than suture annuloplasty, however the suture repair still holds a place. This work was conducted over 60 patients with history of rheumatic heart disease with predominance mitral valve diseases, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and FTR. Group I : 30 patients had ADVTA using intraoperative TEE. Group II: 30 patients had conventional De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty(CDVTA). The two groups were assessed immediately and six months later by TTE. There was a significant relation between PH and tricuspid valve annulus diameter (TVAD) in Group I (mean TVAD in PH grade 2 is 38. 0 + 6. 5 mm, while in PH grade 3 mean TVAD is 41. 1 + 4. 6). Also PH correlates significantly with TVAD in Group II. Results showed advantage of ADVTA in avoiding postoperative residual TR due to accurate application of tension(Preoperative FTR grade 2 in 12 patients and FTR grade 3 in 18 patients, immediate postoperative TR grade 2 in 4 patients and no patient in TRgrade 3,late postoperative TR grade 2 in 6 patients and TR grade 3 in one patient). Results demonstrated superiority of ADVTA in decreasing postoperative diastolic gradient(PODG) on tricuspid valve and in avoiding tricuspid stenosis (immediate PODG in Group I is 5. 4 + 3. 2 mmHg and 9. 1 + 3. 3 mmHg in Group II, late PODG in Group I is 5. 9 + 3. 3 mmHg and 9. 9 + 3. 5 mmHg in Group II). ADVTA <b>guided</b> by <b>TEE</b> still holds a place as it is quick, inexpensive, devoid of use of foreign body especially in the presence of infection, and showed durability...|$|R
40|$|Radiofrequency {{catheter}} ablation (RFCA) is a safe, effective {{therapy for}} accessory AV mediated tachycardia requiring precise {{positioning of the}} ablation catheter. Palliation of single ventricle with the Glenn or Fontan procedure creates obstacles for correct catheter placement. Transesophageal echocardiography(TEE) {{has been used to}} monitor RFCA in children without structural congenital heart disease (CHD) and during interventional catheterization procedures. This report describes our experience with TEE guidance of RFCA in children with palliated single ventricle. Biplane TEE imaging was used to guide mapping and RFCA in 4 children aged 1. 5 – 13 yr. with wt 11 – 43 kg. Three patients had membranous tricuspid atresia (TA) with WPW and 1 patient had double inlet left ventricle (DILV) with a left atrial ectopic focus. All patients had previously undergone palliation for single ventricle: Glenn shunt (1) or modification of the Fontan procedure (3). On line <b>TEE</b> images <b>guided</b> 1 -location of the tricuspid annulus in TA, 2 - crossing of a surgically created ASD, 3 -retrograde entry of the RV via a Glenn shunt, and 4 - retrograde entry of the LV via a Stansel anastomosis. All 4 <b>TEE</b> <b>guided</b> ablations were successful with no early or late complications. ConclusionsReal time TEE images can successfully guide catheter placement in children with palliated single ventricle undergoing RFCA and is superior to fluoroscopy in identifying specific anatomic landmarks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVEWe {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} intravenous thrombolytic treatment under transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance in prosthetic valve thrombosis. BACKGROUNDThrombotic occlusion of prosthetic valves {{continues to be an}} uncommon but serious complication. Intravenous thrombolytic treatment has been proposed as an alternative to surgical intervention. METHODSIn a four-year period, 32 symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve related thrombosis underwent 54 thrombolytic treatment sessions for the treatment of 36 distinct episodes. All patients had low international normalized ratio values at the presentation. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at baseline and repeated after each thrombolytic treatment session (total 98 TEE examinations). Streptokinase was used as the initial agent with a repeat dose given within 24 h when necessary. Recurrent thrombosis was treated either with tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. RESULTSThe initial success after first dose was only 53 % (17 / 32) but increased up to 88 % (28 / 32) after repeated thrombolytic sessions upon documentation of suboptimal results on TEE examination (p < 0. 01). In addition, four asymptomatic patients with large thrombi were also successfully treated with single infusion. The TEE characteristics of thrombus correlated with clinical presentation and response to lytics. Success was achieved with single lytic infusion in 40 % of the obstructive thrombi as compared with 75 % of the nonobstructive ones (p < 0. 05). The success rates of lytic treatment were similar for mitral versus aortic valves, and for tilting disk versus bileaflet valves. Rapid (3 h) and slow (15 to 24 h) infusion of streptokinase resulted in similar success rates. However, major complications (three patients) occurred only in the rapid infusion group. CONCLUSIONIn patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis, intravenous slow infusion thrombolysis given in discrete, successive sessions <b>guided</b> by serial <b>TEE</b> and transthoracic echocardiography can be achieved with a low risk of complications and a high rate of success...|$|R
