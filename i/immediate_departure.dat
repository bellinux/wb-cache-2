(In the view of Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan, who had been privy to Nixon's thinking, the president had known this would be the likely outcome of dismissing Cox.) On October 23, 1973, a landslide of resolutions calling for impeachment, impeachment investigations, and appointment of a special prosecutor were introduced against Nixon. The introduction of these resolutions continued for several days, but the Judiciary Committee was reluctant to start a formal investigation, especially with the Vice Presidency vacant after the resignation amid scandal of Spiro Agnew on October 10, 1973.|$|R

On the island, Faraday starts conducting an experiment regarding the island's unique passage of time. After reuniting with Charlotte, Faraday sneaks off with her to the Tempest Dharma Initiative station, where they neutralize a potential source of poison gas. Later, the corpse of the freighter's doctor washes ashore. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) confronts Faraday and he is forced to confess that the freighter upon which they arrived was not sent to the island to rescue the survivors. Around this time, Daniel realizes the Secondary Protocol, detailing the whereabouts of Ben Linus, has been activated by Widmore, necessitating their <b>immediate</b> <b>departure</b> from the island.

Daniel and five survivors are caught midway, between the Kahana and the island, when the Kahana blows up and the island is [...] "moved" [...] by Ben Linus.|$|E
500|$|Another {{departure}} from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Contrary {{to what is}} shown in the film, Albert was not present at the ceremony; the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic. Furthermore, according to Fellowes, [...] "The scene where [...] is trying to make her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it's completely true", and [...] "The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two-thirds of his speech is what he actually said!" [...] However, the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech; and, undepicted in the film, the princess burst into tears, [...] "and the two parties, soon realising that they had gone too far, patched up an uneasy truce". According to Charles Greville's memoirs: [...] "The Queen [...] looked in deep distress, the Princess [...] burst into tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of Kent said not a word. Immediately after they rose and retired, and a terrible scene ensued; the Duchess announced her <b>immediate</b> <b>departure</b> and ordered her carriage, but a sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day." ...|$|E

40|$|Giant {{honey bees}} (Apis dorsata) of {{southern}} Asia are vital honey producers and pollinators of cultivated crops and wild plants. They {{are known to}} migrate seasonally up to 200 km. It has been assumed their migrations occur stepwise, with stops for rest and foraging, but bivouacking bees have rarely been seen by scientists. Here I report discovery of a site in northern Thailand where bivouacs appeared in large congregations during the wet seasons of 2009 and 2010. The bivouac congregation stopover site is a small mango orchard along the Pai River. Bivouacs rested in branches of mango and other tree species in the <b>immediate</b> vicinity. <b>Departures</b> were preceded by dances indicating approximate direction and apparently, distance of flights. Such consistent stopover sites likely occur throughout southern Asia and may support critical, vulnerable stages in the life history of giant honey bees that must be conserved for populations of the species to survive...|$|R
