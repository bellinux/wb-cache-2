The most common pharmaceuticals detected were [...] nonprescription drugs; detergents, fire retardants, pesticides, natural and synthetic hormones, and an assortment of antibiotics and prescription medications were also found. A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, beta-blockers, anti-convulsant, and steroid hormones. Although most chemical concentrations were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of bioaccumulation of these pharmaceutical compounds.

40|$|Diffuse {{nutrient}} and pesticide {{pollution is}} a major global and growing pressure on water quality and poses risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health and water resources. Due to threats to water quality, the costs of water treatment and the recalcitrance of some pollutants to traditional water treatment techniques, there is increased focus on the potential to mitigate agricultural <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> through catchment management. Water quality models {{have the potential to}} be applied as decision support tools to identify mitigation measures that can reduce agricultural <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution</b> but, to date, insufficient consideration has been given to the uncertainties of water quality model predictions and the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on multiple pollutants and at a daily temporal resolution. To address these shortcomings, and the need to identify mitigation measures that can reduce agricultural <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution,</b> the soil and water assessment tool model was applied to identify the impacts of farm-based mitigation measures on diffuse nitrate, total phosphorus and metaldehyde pollution at a daily time-step within the River Wensum catchment in the East of England. Prohibiting metaldehyde application in areas where the slope exceeded 2 % was the most effective option to mitigate <b>diffuse</b> metaldehyde <b>pollution,</b> whilst introducing a red clover cover crop reduced nitrate losses by 19. 6 % and implementing buffer strips of 6 m width reduced total phosphorus losses by 16. 9 %. Results also highlighted the need to consider the impacts on multiple pollutants and the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures. According to model predictions, a catchment management based approach does have the potential to reduce agricultural <b>diffuse</b> water <b>pollution,</b> the risk of water quality non compliance and the subsequent need for raw water treatment.

40|$|The use of {{riparian}} {{buffer strips}} {{is a possible}} strategy for controlling <b>diffuse</b> nitrate <b>pollution</b> of surface water in agricultural catchments.

Median nitrate–nitrogen levels observed in buffered catchments ranged from 7. 6 to 18. 8 mgN l− 1, but peaked at up to 46. 1 mgN l− 1. The existence of preferential bypass flow paths during the winter flow events limited the effectiveness of nitrate removing processes within the strips. The findings suggest that grassed riparian buffer strips may not be effective in controlling <b>diffuse</b> nitrate <b>pollution</b> unless the hydrology of the strip allows a suitable environment for denitrification and/or plant uptake.

40|$|An area heavily {{impacted}} by open-pit coal mining {{was used to}} demonstrate risks associated {{with the presence of}} toxic metals. The area is located in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic, and is currently categorized as among the most deteriorated landscapes on earth. Open-pit mining and the subsequent landscape restoration may present certain risks of contamination with metals, both in the short and long term. A rather uncertain parameter in this is the behaviour of metals deposited in the mining spoil over the long term. A second important factor is that of reduction in the intensity of agricultural production in the region, which leads to remobilization of metals from the soils. The role of wetlands and their management in the landscape is indispensable in controlling metal mobility and distribution. In setting up priorities for remediation, pollution from point sources should be sharply distinguished from the diffused sources.

40|$|In {{the past}} the quality of {{receiving}} waters has been continuously improved by upgrading measures on both industrial and urban waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and sewer systems. However, latest inventories of sources and pathways of pollutants originating from industrial and domestic use and activities, for example carried out for the river Rhine catchment, {{emphasize the importance of}} <b>diffuse</b> nonpoint <b>pollution</b> on water quality in urbanized river catchments in comparison to the loads of point sources form industrial or urban WWTPs, for which a reduction on about 70 % of the status of 1985 was considered in 1995. In order to obtain detailed information on the fate of heavy metals in river catchments, this study was carried out mainly to collect representative literature about possible <b>diffuse</b> nonpoint <b>pollution</b> sources, to monitor concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn) in stormwater overflows and to assess these loads discharged into receiving waters. An extensive literature survey was carried out resulting in a database containing 121 references with more than 2100 values especially about the pollution sources FARMING and URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE. The database was adapted to the register on <b>diffuse</b> nonpoint <b>pollution</b> of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR). While only a few references on <b>diffuse</b> nonpoint <b>pollution</b> sources were evaluated for Hg, Cr and Ni and the pathways within the urban drainage systems (e. g. effluents of stormwater retention basins, combined sewer overflows) a remarkable number of references could be collected for the other heavy metals and diffuse sources and pathways respectively. Due to the lack of precise data on {{the current state of the}} art of stormwater treatment in Germany a field study was carried out in Herrenberg. Objects of the investigation were two different stormwater retention basins (SRB) at two well defined catchments. In the field study about nine events of stormwater overflows at SRB 1 and eleven events at SRB 2 were sampled. The results (event mean concentration) indicate a high level but match the values of the evaluated references. However, specific heavy metal pollution loads referring to the impervious catchment area show high values in particular SRB 1 with its urbanized hinterland. Based on the evaluated literature database and observed EMCs in stormwater overflows a semi-empirical model has been developed to assess heavy metal loads in receiving waters from considered pollution sources.
