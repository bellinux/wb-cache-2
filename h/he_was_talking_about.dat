5|$|When Raghavan {{is about}} to leave his house for a {{marriage}} proposal, Sundaram comes there and describes the girl <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> to Raghavan. Raghavan realises that Radha, whom he intends to marry, is the same girl Sundaram is in love with. Raghavan, believing that Radha loves Sundaram, decides to help Sundaram attain his love and {{get a chance to}} act in films, which he does successfully. Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan why he did not show up for the marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E

Matthews' fining was criticised by several anti smoking activists.|$|E

Even if Smith meant that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, Gray further points out that no one (outside of the conspirators) knew of Mitchell's {{involvement}} until the following April, when John Dean admitted as much to special prosecutors.|$|E

The Prepper, a Raven of Dee, left the organization due to a difference in interpreting Dee's prophecy. According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world; the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> something worse.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} night, {{the band}} opened for Willie Nelson at Toronto's prestigious Massey Hall. A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, {{with people in}} the audience yelling [...] "here comes the gravy!" [...] when Thornton tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host. Before the show, when asked about his [...] "gravy" [...] comment, Thornton claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the radio host. Local reviews of Thornton's Toronto performance were not positive. Toronto Star called Thornton's voice a [...] "high, tinny whine" [...] and The Globe and Mail commented that [...] "Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things". On April 10, The Boxmasters dropped out of the tour early, announcing {{that they would not be}} playing with Nelson during subsequent concerts scheduled in London, Ontario and Montreal. Thornton said that band members had come down with the flu. Willie Nelson's publicist had no comment.|$|E
500|$|Developed {{over the}} years 1926–1929 at Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Langley Field in Virginia, a forward-looking {{doctrine}} of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by four instructors who argued that an enemy's army and navy could be defeated intact due {{to the destruction of}} industrial and military targets deep within enemy-held territory. This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet, though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed. In contrast, American theorists devised a strategy of pin-point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons. Though unproven, the major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly, with minimal casualties, and that grinding, static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided. In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said [...] "the bomber will always get through", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the terror bombing of cities. The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission. They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets, not populations.|$|E

Later in the year, Timbaland produced songs for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's LP, Strength & Loyalty and the song [...] "Ayo Technology" [...] on 50 Cent’s album Curtis. Timbaland also produced most of the tracks on Ashlee Simpson's third CD, Bittersweet World, including the song [...] "Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)". On April 3, 2007, Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists including 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Fall Out Boy, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott, and others called Timbaland Presents Shock Value. A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The tension initially started on the single [...] "Give It to Me", when Timbaland anonymously backlashed Storch: [...] "I'm a real producer and you just the piano man". In an interview, Timbaland confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Storch. The dispute partly stemmed from controversy regarding writing credits for Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River".|$|E

[...] Bach also said that Chinese Democracys delay might be because of business problems: [...] "I think there's a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy.

2500|$|Bevin was a {{physically}} large man, strong {{and by the}} time of his political prominence very heavy. He spoke with a strong West Country accent, so much so that on one occasion listeners at Cabinet had difficulty in deciding whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Hugh and Nye (Gaitskell and Bevan)" [...] or [...] "you and I".

People {{from all parts of the}} world would come to Imperial College and seek Dr. Salam's help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense.

2500|$|Wirnt von Gravenberg, writing {{early in}} the thirteenth century, {{mentioned}} the Courier Game in his poem Wigalois, and expected his readers to know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> [...] Heinrich von Beringen, about a hundred years later, mentioned {{the introduction of the}} couriers as an improvement in chess.

50|$|Touching a person's {{genitals}} without consent (also {{known as}} groping) is considered sexual assault in most jurisdictions in the United States. Many attorneys and media commentators characterized Trump's statements as describing acts of sexual assault. Lisa Bloom, {{a sexual harassment}} expert and civil rights lawyer, stated: “Let’s <b>be</b> very clear, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> sexual assault. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> grabbing a woman’s genitals without her consent.” Trump {{and some of his}} supporters claimed that Trump <b>was</b> not saying <b>he</b> committed a sexual assault, or denied that groping is sexual assault.

Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean was familiar with the location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary.

2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ...

And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda knew who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef.
