500|$|In the song's opening verse, Harrison {{admits that}} he [...] "Can't say what I'm doing here" [...] in the {{material}} world, a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers [...] "eschatological hope" [...] with the subsequent line, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much clearer". Harrison then states that he uses his body [...] "like a car / Taking me both near and far". Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since our bodies [...] "are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Total Film named Nolan the 32nd {{greatest}} {{director of}} all time, and in 2012, The Guardian ranked him # 14 {{on their list}} of [...] "The 23 Best Film Directors in the World" [...] In 2013, a survey of 17 film academics showed that Nolan {{was among the most}} studied directors in Britain.

Renowned video game designer Hideo Kojima compared Dunkirk to his own work: [...] "Its approach to technology in movie making and refusal to rely on defeating one's enemies as a portrayal of war, reminds me in many ways of my work on Metal Gear and where <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> my next game go". In 2015, Time featured Nolan as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{exception}} {{was by the}} Dominican Republic, which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms.

60|$|When I {{go about}} {{here in a}} gondola, I {{surprise}} myself looking into other gondolas as if <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. It would overcome me with joy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them, but I don't think it would surprise me much, at first. In my fanciful times, I fancy {{that they might be}} anywhere; and I almost expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their dear faces on the bridges or the quays.|$|R
2500|$|... 24 March 2011, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman said: [...] "The same principles, {{activities}} the Western world [...] in Libya ... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those {{regarding the}} Iranian {{regime and the}} Syrian regime."

[...] After the conference Meir told the press: [...] "There is only one thing <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> before I die {{and that is that}} my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore."

6000|$|... "Not he, poor fellow! He {{will be here}} to-morrow or next day. When I last wrote," [...] Miss Jillgall continued, [...] "I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you again soon. If you can't help us (I mean with Eunice) that unlucky young man will do some desperate thing.

6000|$|... "It {{was not my}} {{intention}} to take leave of you when I said good-by to the rest, but <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you in classe. I was disappointed.
