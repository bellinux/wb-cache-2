25|$|The {{building}} was {{designed in the}} Italianate architectural style. It features a veranda, though not original, which winds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> around the building, to the secondary entrance on the home's south side. The door has the name G.P. Wild etched into its glass.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} comprises six {{rooms with}} the former lounge and dining room to the east separated from four former bedrooms to the west by a central hall and lobby running <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> to the kitchen at the rear. The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in wardrobes, drawers and shelving. The walls throughout the house and onto the verandahs have a single lining of vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards with ceilings lined in asbestos cement sheeting and finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
500|$|The {{police were}} to {{transport}} the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required {{to wait in line}} for about 15minutes. Those who were not arrested were released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: [...] "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic." ...|$|E
50|$|Partway {{through the}} 2010 model year, the GM badges were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SS {{model was}} removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> market after the 2010 model year due to GM {{shuttering}} its HPVO Group. [...] In addition, GM phased out all GM badges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> for <b>the</b> 2010.5 model year, including the Chevrolet HHR.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{than the}} isolation, {{they found the}} most {{difficult}} aspect {{of living in the}} lighthouse to be making [...] furniture fit against the curved walls. For fun, they primarily watched television, or fished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Richard Moreland would occasionally swim in the river, with a rope tied around his waist so the currents would not carry him away. He said it was the best job in the Coast Guard since {{he did not have to}} pay for housing, and no traveling salesman came to call.|$|E
2500|$|... and {{it still}} has the {{original}} big, old, pannelled front door. It is of the traditional rural, symmetrical, [...] four-up, four-down domestic design which was common in the Georgian era and continued throughout the 19th century. [...] This type of house has two rooms {{each side of the}} front door, stairs in the middle leading back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and two upstairs bedrooms each side of the stairwell, with a 19th-century dressing room above the front hall. The walls between front and back rooms are load-bearing, and supported by the two chimneys, which allow fireplaces in all eight main rooms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{estate was}} known as Lakeland Farm. Mr. Dole lived there with his wife Julia, his mother-in-law, Mrs. Harriet Coffin, his two daughters, Mary Florence, Harriet (Hattie), and son, Sydney. Dole {{maintained}} the estate for over 30 years, entertaining lavishly. As an example, for his daughter's wedding in 1883 he built a spur line from the Chicago and Northwestern railway tracks almost to his doorstep. A canopied and carpeted walkway extended [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> to the train enabling the guests {{to walk to the}} mansion for the ceremony and return to the train without concern for the weather. Notable wedding guests included Julian Rumsey (mayor of Chicago and Dole's first cousin) and Levi Leiter (first partner with Marshall Field).|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} {{are short}} (16 m) and can barely accommodate a British Rail Class 153 train. Passengers can only alight <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of any train calling here, so the conductor on longer trains must give passengers advance notice {{so that they}} have time to move towards <b>the</b> <b>front</b> set of <b>doors.</b>|$|R
60|$|With a {{flourish}} Washington Bones drew up the panting horses in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> Basswood place. Just as Ben leaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sleigh <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> house opened and Mrs. Basswood appeared.|$|R
50|$|The final {{model year}} of the RELAY. The Saturn logos had been dropped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> and <b>the</b> all-wheel drive option was no longer available. The Relay was {{discontinued}} after the 2007 model year. The Doraville, Georgia assembly plant closed in September 2008. The last 2007 RELAY rolled off the line on November 17, 2006. The Relay {{was replaced by the}} 8-passenger, Lambda-based Outlook crossover SUV.|$|R
2500|$|Faith Cole MacLean and her husband, actor Douglas MacLean, were Taylor's neighbors, and Faith {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have seen Taylor's killer. The couple was startled by a loud noise at 8pm. MacLean went to her front door and saw someone emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of Taylorâ€™s home who she said was dressed, [...] "like my idea of a motion picture burglar". She recalled this person {{paused for a moment}} before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and flashed a smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E
2500|$|The fare for SBS is {{the same}} as on all New York City Transit local and limited-stop buses, $2.75, payable with a MetroCard or coins. Boarding {{procedures}} for the S79 SBS are the same as those on regular local and limited-stop buses. On all other SBS services, unlike other bus lines in New York City, fare collection for SBS uses a proof-of-payment system. Passengers are required to pay their fare before boarding the bus at pay stations located in bus shelters at the designated stops (for customers using UniTicket, which is valid for boarding). Once fare payment is made, one must board the bus at that stop within one hour. Boarding can be done via any of the two or three doors (depending on the bus fleet), except on S79 buses, where all passengers board <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> since fares are paid on board. New York City Transit fare inspectors (organized in [...] "EAGLE" [...] teams), NYPD officers, or MTA police officers check for proof of payment receipts; those unable to produce one are subject to a fine of up to $100. These inspections are conducted randomly, or through the entire bus at specific stations.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{main entrance}} from Herbert Street is raised several steps above <b>the</b> footpath. Recessed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> alignment <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> are {{a pair of}} half-glazed French doors. A series of French doors provide access <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper level to the verandah.|$|R

25|$|In February 1960 the ALSI-2-1 {{series was}} released. The Deluxe, {{along with the}} {{commercial}} variants, were updated with quad headlights (the standard model retained the twin headlights). The side strip design was changed on standard models; the V-shape in the side strip was moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> to <b>the</b> rear doors. On Deluxe models the side strip design remained the same. The standard model gained quad headlights in September 1960 {{with the release of}} the ALSI-2-2 series.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear old fellow!' said Lady Merrifield, as {{she turned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> while he drove off. 'He is like a gust of old Beechcroft air! But I should think Victoria had a handful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gladly," [...] said Julius. [...] "I {{ought to}} have gone last night; but what with Rose, and the baby, and Terry, I am afraid I forgot everything."

50|$|The attack {{targeted}} {{a traffic}} police post {{at a major}} intersection, not far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of a Starbucks coffee shop and a Burger King franchise. The post was heavily damaged by explosions. Although three explosions in Cikini, Slipi, and Kuningan neighbourhoods, near Turkish and Pakistan embassies were reported, the Jakarta police later denied these explosions, as well as attacks in Simatupang and Palmerah, as a hoax. One explosion went {{off in front of}} a shopping centre called the Sarinah mall, near the UN office.|$|R
50|$|Welsh chapels {{up until}} that point had the facing wall with the pulpit located between two <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> Peniel Chapel changed this {{interior}} design concept to one resembling the auditorium of a theatre. The chapel interior, with a ramped gallery floor, has the pulpit on <b>the</b> opposite side <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> This was <b>the</b> first {{example of such a}} layout in a Welsh chapel and was highly influential for later chapel architecture in Wales. Notable later examples of this style were in the settlements of Seion, Cwmaman, Bethesda, Gwynedd, and Llanrwst, Conwy County Borough.|$|R

He is buried there in St. Michael's Churchyard, Mickleham. The tomb, and Government of Canada marker outside, are steps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> church. He is the only deceased former Canadian Prime Minister not buried in Canada. Unmarried, Bennett was survived by nephews William Herridge, Jr., and Robert Coats, and by brother Ronald V. Bennett. The viscountcy became extinct on his death.|$|R
60|$|The instant {{resistance}} was over, Captain Davenant ran {{out with his}} men to secure the horses. A few of the Hessians, who had escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> had jumped {{on the backs of}} the nearest animals and ridden off. The rest had fled on foot, and the exulting troopers counted seventy-two horses remaining in their hands. Captain Davenant at once returned to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma'--" [...] cried Orlando Furioso, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> Mrs. Abbott {{being very}} rigid in {{requiring}} that all her children should call her 'ma',' being so much behind the age as actually {{not to know}} that 'mother' had got to be much the genteeler term of the two; [...] "Ma'," [...] roared Orlando Furioso, [...] "suppose there is no news at Mr. Jones's store?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{coming to}} the back door," [...] said Felicity, with an {{agitated}} glance around the kitchen. [...] "I told you, Dan, {{that you should have}} shovelled the snow away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> this morning. Cecily, set those pots in the pantry quick--hide those boots, Felix--shut the cupboard door, Peter--Sara, straighten up the lounge.

50|$|The C151A {{trains are}} similar to the C751B trains in terms of {{exterior}} looks, and have an identical propulsion motor sound. The only obvious difference comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> C151A trains.|$|R
50|$|The three-door Isuzu MU {{made its}} debut in Japan during 1989, with the five-door MU Wizard {{introduced}} the following year. Based on the Isuzu Faster (TF) pickup truck of 1988, both the three- and five-door models shared bodywork and most internal components <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> forward. Like <b>the</b> Faster pickup, the MU and MU Wizard featured rear- and four-wheel drive layout configurations. Japanese sales were limited {{by the fact that}} the exterior width dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the engine displacement obligated Japanese drivers for higher levels of annual road tax.|$|R
60|$|And {{now these}} young people had to resume life in London in earnest. The orchestral accompaniment of {{the world at large}} began to mingle with their {{hitherto}} unsustained duet. It had been inaudible in Italy. In Chelsea it had sounded, faintly perhaps but distinctly, from their very first inspection of the little house. A drawing-room speaks of callers, a dining-room of lunch-parties and dinners. It had swayed Marjorie <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> inward.|$|E
60|$|The two {{men stood}} looking at one another across the table. Strange {{thoughts}} were framing themselves in the brains of both of them. Then there came a startling and in its way a dramatic interlude. Through the empty house came the ringing of the electric bell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> shrill and insistent. Without a moment's hesitation, Quest hurried out, and French followed him. On the door-step was another surprise. Lenora and Laura were there, the former carrying a small, black-bound volume.|$|E
6000|$|I have, as it were, the two {{extremities}} of {{the moral}} world at my threshold. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> a few minutes' walk brings me {{into the heart of}} a wealthy and populous city; as many paces from my opposite entrance place me in a solitude as complete as Zimmerman could have desired. Surely, with such aids to my imagination, I may write better than if I were in a lodging in the New Town or a garret in the old. As the Spaniard says, [...] "VIAMOS--CARACCO!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{donated to the}} Shire in 1974 and ex {{industrial}} factory engineer Graham Jones helped move the engine to its present location. Due to the engine's size, bricks <b>from</b> around <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> had to be removed.|$|R
40|$|Georg-Schmidt-Schule in Korsten P. E. " ("Georg-Schmidt-School in Korsten P. E. ").

60|$|Little by little, however, we had won {{through the}} day, {{and the boys}} had {{subsided}} into comparative quiet over their evening preparation, when <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> there sounded <b>the</b> purring of the engine of a large automobile.
