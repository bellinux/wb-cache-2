5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> devoted to females as female wasps are 1.16 {{times larger than}} male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

Typically {{there are multiple}} buyers, multiple sellers and heterogeneous gains from trade. In some markets a buyer and seller must make different and separate investments to trade, in others <b>investments</b> <b>are</b> jointly made and negotiated. These <b>investments</b> <b>are</b> subject to inefficiencies: under-investment, due to potential hold-up, and over-investment to generate “outside options”. When <b>investments</b> <b>are</b> separate over-investment is limited. In contrast, inefficiency from under-investment cannot be bounded.

5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E
