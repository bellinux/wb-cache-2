50|$|G3's long {{distance}} retail offerings cover access dial, direct <b>dial,</b> calling <b>cards,</b> and 1010 <b>dial</b> around service under the brand 10-10-ALO (ALO Telecom). Alternatively, they provide origination, termination and re-billing services to their wholesale clients.|$|R
5000|$|On November 15, 1958, 105.1 FM {{signed on}} as WVCG-FM. [...] It {{simulcast}} its AM sister station, 1070 WVCG (now 1080 WHIM), the [...] "Voice of Coral Gables." [...] WVCG was the first classical music station in Florida and WVCG-FM was the first FM station in Florida to broadcast in stereo. In 1968, the station became WYOR, [...] "YOuR beautiful music station," [...] airing mostly instrumental versions of popular songs and music from Broadway and Hollywood. WYOR promoted itself using an FM radio <b>dial</b> <b>card,</b> listing WYOR at 105.1 along with the dial positions of other FM stations in the Miami radio market. The card was updated each year.|$|R
5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and <b>dial</b> <b>card),</b> altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|R
50|$|A 24-hour {{watch with}} a compass <b>card</b> <b>dial</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} direction when set to local noon and used in conjunction with the sun.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 October 2014 an {{explosion}} {{occurred in a}} house in the Khagragarh locality of Burdwan. Two suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorists were killed and a third injured. The police seized 55 improvised explosive devices, RDX, wrist watch <b>dials</b> and SIM <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{police arrested}} the two women. More than 50 improvised {{explosive}} devices were recovered. The police also seized large numbers of wrist watch <b>dials,</b> SIM <b>cards</b> and tools used to prepare {{improvised explosive devices}}. Micro SD cards containing propaganda songs, Taliban training videos were recovered. Fake Indian documents like elector's card and passport were found. Maps and half burnt books in Arabic too were recovered. The CID detonated the improvised explosive devices {{on the banks of}} Damodar.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Card</b> <b>dials</b> {{are another}} form of {{altitude}} <b>dial.</b> [...] A <b>card</b> is aligned edge-on with the sun and tilted so that a ray of light passes through an aperture onto a specified spot, thus determining the sun's altitude. A weighted string hangs vertically downwards from {{a hole in the}} card, and carries a bead or knot. The position of the bead on the hour-lines of the card gives the time. In more sophisticated versions such as the Capuchin dial, there is only one set of hour-lines, i.e., the hour lines do not vary with the seasons. Instead, the position of the hole from which the weighted string hangs is varied according to the season.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} forces {{of a few}} nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass <b>dials</b> or <b>cards</b> instead of needles. A magnetic card compass is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the compass card while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo). Magnetic card compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool {{in order to take}} bearings directly from a map.|$|R
50|$|The Horizon {{was then}} updated in 1985, with {{different}} interior trim again slight changes to instrument <b>dials</b> and door <b>cards</b> {{were to make}} the car look more modern, but along with the Fiat Ritmo/Strada, it was now the oldest mainstream family hatchback on sale in Europe, and was now faced with competition from even more new competitors.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} types of knitting machines, ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce {{various types of}} knitted fabrics, usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity. Pattern stitches can be selected by hand manipulation of the needles, or with push-buttons and <b>dials,</b> mechanical punch <b>cards,</b> or electronic pattern reading devices and computers.|$|R
