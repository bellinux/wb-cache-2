25|$|How {{by means}} of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not {{describe}} my method of remaining under water, or how long <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction {{at the bottom of the}} sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E
500|$|Tin Toy gained Disney's attention, and the {{new team}} at The Walt Disney Company—CEO Michael Eisner and {{chairman}} Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division —began a quest to get Lasseter to come back. Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, [...] "I can go to Disney and be a director, or <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> here and make history." [...] Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, {{who used to work}} at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't go too far into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E

In an interview with MMA Junkie the day prior to his GWC fight, Lashley indicated that he had two potential fights lined up for August 2013, saying [...] "If I'm going to fight, I need to fight. I need to stay active. I {{need to do something}} big now. If not, I need to hang it up and just do stuff with my gym. I'm fighting this fight, and I think I have two in August that were offered to me. Hopefully if I don't get hurt, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> active and just keep going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vanessa {{was created}} in 2009 by Holby City {{executive}} producer Tony McHale, {{as a replacement for}} former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet), who departed from the show during its eleventh series. It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> on. Also, I know there are lots of women out there who love this show and I don’t want them to be disappointed. I want them to say, 'She looks great!'".|$|E
