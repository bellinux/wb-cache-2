5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|The banded sugar ant is {{considered}} a household pest and is occasionally seen in houses at night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; carbon disulphide is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray <b>formic</b> <b>acid,</b> however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> they spray is corrosive to human skin. The eggs of this species were consumed by the Australian Aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Using modern catalysts, this {{reaction}} {{can have an}} acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are ethyl acetate, <b>formic</b> <b>acid,</b> and formaldehyde, {{all of which have}} lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{electrophysiological}} and behavioural tests {{were performed on}} Siagona europaea Dejean 1826 adults to investigate the importance of chemical cues in ant location. Olfactory responses of labial palp to terpenoids (citral, limonene and geraniol), carboxylic <b>acids</b> (acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids),</b> aliphatic ketones (heptanone) and aldehydes (hexanal) were tested {{by means of an}} electropalpogram (EPG) bioassay. Our electrophysiological results showed that only acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> evoked EPG responses. Y-shape olfactometer bioassays showed that adults were attracted by acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> The role of these chemicals on prey detection is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Propionic acid has {{physical}} properties intermediate between {{those of the}} smaller carboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>formic</b> and acetic <b>acids,</b> and the larger fatty acids. [...] It is miscible with water, but can be removed from water by adding salt. [...] As with acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids,</b> {{it consists of hydrogen}} bonded pairs of molecules as both the liquid and the vapor.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Decontaminating meat {{surfaces}} {{has been}} the big concern of meat industry. Thus, various intervention strategies have been studied to reduce the level of bacteria on animals carcass surfaces. Approach: Mixture of different concentrations 1, 1. 5 and 2 % of acetic, lactic, propionic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> at 1 : 1 ratio were spray washed on inoculated meat to evaluate their efficacy in reducing numbers of Staphylococcus aureus on meat tissue at 4 ± 1 °C. The beef pieces were decontaminated with hot water and then inoculated with S. aureus which then were spray washed with treatments for 15 sec separately. Results: Spray wash combinations of acetic and formic, lactic and formic and propionic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> {{reduced the number of}} S. aureus at a range of 1. 18 - 1. 43 log cfu mL - 1 more than combinations of acetic and lactic, acetic and propionic and lactic and propionic acids on meat tissue. Increasing the concentration of used acids increased the lethality of treatments as lethal effect of 2 % concentration > 1. 5 % concentration > 1 %concentration. Conclusion: Lactic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> Combination showed the strongest lethal effect on S. aureus among other treatments. Moreover, this study showed that the combination of lactic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> treatment is a feasible, safe, and economical decontamination method which is highly recommended for use rather than other combinations or single organic acids...|$|R
5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, <b>formic</b> <b>acid,</b> gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can also}} carry mites, but {{a study of}} the feather mite Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> from the insects deters parasites).|$|E
5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} tetra-alkylthiuram disulphides has been developed, based on the quantitative oxidation of carbon disulphide produced by acidified chloramine-T to sulphuric and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> Twenty-eight equivalents of chloramine-T are required per mole of a thiuram disulphide...|$|R
30|$|For the {{measurement}} in the National military museum and the Tismana monastery, Memori-EWO (PPO) dosimeters {{were used to}} measure the photo-oxidizing effect and passive pollution badge samplers [35] for acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> were {{used to measure the}} acidic effect (Fig.  1).|$|R
50|$|In principle, {{allyl alcohol}} can be {{obtained}} by dehydrogenation of propanol. In the laboratory, it has been prepared by the reaction of glycerol with oxalic or <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> Allyl alcohols in general can be prepared by allylic oxidation of allyl compounds by selenium dioxide.|$|R
5|$|Feathers require {{maintenance}} and birds preen or groom them daily, spending {{an average of}} around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria. This may be supplemented with the secretions of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.|$|E
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create <b>formic</b> <b>acid,</b> which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
30|$|Cl. bifermentans is able {{to produce}} {{a wide range of}} {{metabolites}} such as acetic, butyric and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> (Wu & Yang 2003), ethanol, butanol, aceton (Khanal et al. 2004), carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen (Levin et al. 2006). However, the metabolic pathway of Cl. bifermentans has not been investigated in detail so far.|$|R
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} oxidn. of D-glucose and D-fructose with O in aq., alk. solns. is studied, and {{a reaction}} scheme proposed {{to account for}} the obsd. reaction products. Formation of enolate anions is followed by non-oxidative reactions (involving double-bond migration and cleavage) and by oxidative formation of peroxides, leading to the formation, of D-arabinonic, D-erythronic, D-glyceric, glycolic, and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
30|$|The acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> were {{measured}} with passive pollution badge samplers. The gases diffuse though the net into the badge sampler (Fig.  3) and are absorbed {{from the air}} on an alkaline filter located at its base. Subsequent laboratory analysis gave the values for the concentrations of the acids in air. The detection limit {{has been found to}} be 0.5  µg/m 3 [23].|$|R
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, <b>formic</b> <b>acid,</b> hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: <b>formic</b> <b>acid.</b> Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
50|$|Toilet bowl {{cleaning}} {{often is}} aimed at removal of calcium carbonate deposits, which are attacked by acids. Powdered cleaners contain acids that {{come in the form}} of solid salts, such as sodium hydrogen sulfate. Liquid toilet bowl cleaners contain other acids, typically dilute hydrochloric, phosphoric, or <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> These convert the calcium carbonate into salts that are soluble in water or are easily rinsed away.|$|R
40|$|A coiled or 'C-shaped', Gram-negative, non-motile {{bacterium}} {{was isolated}} from the anaerobic waters of Ace Lake, an Antarctic lake of salinity similar to seawater. The strain was obligately anaerobic and lacked oxidase, catalase and respiratory lipoquinones. It fermented glucose and peptones, and formed H 2, Cot, and butyric, acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> as major end-products. Pyruvate was metabolized to H 2, C 02, and acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> The organism had an optimum temperature for growth of 15 - 16 "C, and no growth occurred at 22 "C. In synthetic medium, the generation time at 1. 7 "C (in situ lake temperature) was 53 h. The optimum NaCl concentration for growth was 0. 3 M, with poor growth at 0. 1 M (5. 8 %, w/v). The mol % G + C of the DNA was 25. 9 & 0. 4 % (T,,,). The bacterium could not be accommodated within current bacterial species based on phenotypic criteria. Although coiled bacteria have been previously observed in Antarctic anaerobic environments, {{they had not been}} cultivated, and their metabolic capability and possible ecological role were unknown...|$|R
30|$|For the {{preparation}} of any scaffold materials, the solution form of the parent compound/polymer is required to proceed further. However, {{in the case of}} chitosan and collagen, acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> were generally used for dissolution Ohkawa et al. (2004; El-Tahlawy et al. 2006). The ‘proton exchange’ between the -COOH groups of acid molecule and free -NH 2 groups of chitosan and collagen could be the reason for the dissolution in the said acids.|$|R
25|$|<b>Formic</b> <b>acid</b> in 85% {{concentration}} is flammable, and diluted <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is on the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration list of food additives. The principal danger from <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> is from skin or eye contact with the concentrated liquid or vapors. The U.S. OSHA Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> vapor in the work environment is 5 parts per million parts of air (ppm).|$|E
25|$|<b>Formic</b> <b>acid</b> is a colorless liquid {{having a}} pungent, {{penetrating}} odor at room temperature. It is miscible {{with water and}} most polar organic solvents, and is somewhat soluble in hydrocarbons. In hydrocarbons and in the vapor phase, it consists of hydrogen-bonded dimers rather than individual molecules. Owing to its tendency to hydrogen-bond, gaseous <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> does not obey the ideal gas law. Solid <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> (two polymorphs) consists of an effectively endless network of hydrogen-bonded <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> molecules. This relatively complicated compound also forms a low-boiling azeotrope with water (22.4%) and liquid <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> also tends to supercool.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{researchers}} of EPFL, Switzerland, {{reported the}} use of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> as a hydrogen storage material. Carbon monoxide free hydrogen has been generated in a very wide pressure range (1–600 bar). A homogeneous catalytic system based on water-soluble ruthenium catalysts selectively decompose HCOOH into H2 and CO2 in aqueous solution. This catalytic system overcomes the limitations of other catalysts (e.g. poor stability, limited catalytic lifetimes, formation of CO) for the decomposition of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> making it a viable hydrogen storage material. And the co-product of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, {{can be used as}} hydrogen vector by hydrogenating it back to <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> in a second step. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 has long been studied and efficient procedures have been developed. <b>Formic</b> <b>acid</b> contains 53 g L−1 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. By weight, pure <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> stores 4.3 wt% hydrogen. Pure <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> is a liquid with a flash point 69°C (cf. gasoline −40°C, ethanol 13°C). 85% <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> is not flammable.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the total}} lipid and {{phospholipid}} content, the degree of unsatn. of lipids, the lipase activity, the levels of oxaloacetic, acetic, and <b>formic</b> <b>acids,</b> the ketone bodies, and cholesterol content, on thermal acclimation of the tropical earthworm, L. mauritii, were studied. The total fat content, the <b>formic</b> and oxaloacetic <b>acid</b> levels decreased significantly on acclimation to a decreasing temp. The unsatn. of lipids, the lipase activity, the levels of acetic, β-​hydroxybutyric, and acetoacetic acids and cholesterol showed a significant increase on cold temp. adaptation.

5000|$|The MR test, the [...] "M" [...] {{portion of}} the four IMViC tests, is used to {{identify}} enteric bacteria based on their pattern of glucose metabolism. All enterics initially produce pyruvic acid from glucose metabolism. Some enterics subsequently use the mixed acid pathway to metabolize pyruvic acid to other acids, such as lactic, acetic, and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> These bacteria are called methyl-red positive and include Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Other enterics subsequently use the butylene glycol pathway to metabolize pyruvic acid to neutral end products. These bacteria are called methyl-red-negative and include Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes.|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} organic and {{inorganic}} acids present in soft drinks were evaluated {{with the aid}} of a PbO 2 – based sensor. The samples presented a total titratable acidity between 130 - 200 mg H+ L– 1, of which only 6 - 8 % was related to phosphoric acid. Considering the total acidity and phosphate content a trial to identify the main organic acidic components in the soft drinks was performed using liquid chromatography. Malic acid was found to be present in the highest concentration, but citric, tartaric, glycolic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> were also identified. However the pKa values suggested that these acids were mainly in their non-dissociated forms...|$|R
25|$|<b>Formic</b> <b>acid</b> {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by aqueous catalytic partial oxidation of wet biomass (OxFA process). A Keggin-type polyoxometalate (H5PV2Mo10O40) is used as the homogeneous catalyst to convert sugars, wood, waste paper or cyanobacteria to <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> and CO2 as the sole byproduct. Yields of up to 53% <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> is produced as a byproduct {{in the manufacture of}} other chemicals. At one time, acetic acid was produced on a large scale by oxidation of alkanes, by a process that cogenerates significant <b>formic</b> <b>acid.</b> This oxidative route to acetic acid is declining in importance, so that the aforementioned dedicated routes to <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> have become more important.|$|E
25|$|Heat and {{especially}} acids cause <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> to decompose to carbon monoxide (CO) and water (dehydration). Treatment of <b>formic</b> <b>acid</b> with sulfuric acid is a convenient laboratory source of CO.|$|E
40|$|Bio-oil {{produced}} from fast pyrolysis of biomass contains {{various levels of}} acetic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> derived from breakdown of cellulose and hemi-cellulose components. Removal of these organic acids from bio-oil was investigated for use as industrial chemicals {{as well as to}} improve the quality of recovered bio-oil as fuel in various applications. Calcium oxide and a quaternary ammonium anion-exchange resin were used to form acid salts of the organic acids, which were then separated, and the organic acids were generated by reacting with sulfuric acid. Both methods were found to be effective in limited ways and various difficulties encountered in this approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of {{fatty alcohol}} polyglycol ethers was studied {{by analyzing the}} 14 C-labeled intermediates isolated from the effluent of a model continuous-flow sewage treatment plant after dosage of either alkyl- or heptaglycol-labeled stearyl alcohol ethoxylate (SA- 7 EO). In each case, uncharged and carboxylated (mainly dicarboxylated) polyethylene glycols constituted the most prominent metabolites. The results indicate {{that there is a}} faster degradation of the alkyl than the polyethylene glycol moiety and that there are two distinct primary degradation mechanisms acting simultaneously in microbial biocenoses: intramolecular scission of the surfactant as well as omega- and beta-oxidation of the alkyl chain. Characterization of the bulk of 14 C-labeled metabolites as a homologous series of neutral and acidic polyglycol units and identification of several C 2 -fragments accounted for the depolymerization of the hydrophilic part of the surfactant by stepwise cleavage of ether-bound EO units; from additional degradation studies employing either neutral or carboxylated 14 C-labeled polyethylene glycols as model metabolites, it was concluded that hydrolytic as well as oxidative cleavage of C 2 -units is involved. Most of the identified low-molecular-weight 14 C-labeled acids suggest an ultimate degradation of EO monomers by the oxidative dicarbonic acid cycle or the glycerate pathway or both. In addition, the finding of considerable amounts of oxalic and <b>formic</b> <b>acids</b> allow consideration of an additional mineralization route via glyoxylic, oxalic, and <b>formic</b> <b>acids.</b> The simultaneous action of different degradation mechanisms indicates the involvement of several distinct bacterial groups in the biodegradation of fatty alcohol ethoxylates under environmental conditions...|$|R
