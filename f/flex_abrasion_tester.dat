40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of certain {{abrasion}} procedures upon specific physical properties of a high wet modulus rayon. The type of abrasion applied included surface abrasion in dry and wet condition, edge abrasion in dry condition, and <b>flexing</b> <b>abrasion</b> in dry condition. Dry <b>flexing</b> <b>abrasion</b> was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other abrasion procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, weight of fabric and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate abrasion damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the percentage losses in physical properties or (2) between period of abrasion and the percentage losses in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the percentage losses in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage of the fabric, yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of abrasion. The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the percentage losses in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of abrasion. Some abrasion procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater percentage losses in breaking load and weight of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion than to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in elongation.
