5|$|Growing up in Pittsburgh, creator Ben Jones had an {{appreciation}} for comics and animation. His father's Macintosh computer served {{as a vehicle for}} Jones to create art and influenced his later visual style. Jones attended the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in the mid-1990s, where he became motivated to launch a project he could adapt to different media. This impetus manifested itself in the characters Alfe, Horace, and Roba. Tux Dog, another principal character, was designed while Jones was in primary school. After his graduation, Jones formed the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci in 2000. The collective moved that year to Providence, Rhode Island, to participate in the Fort Thunder music venue. After the venue's closure in 2001, Jones released animations on the Web using Adobe <b>Flash,</b> <b>with</b> some featuring Alfe.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|The Problem Solverz is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} that aired on Cartoon Network. Created by Ben Jones, it follows Alfe, Horace, and Roba, {{a group of}} detectives in their troubled town, Farboro. The aforementioned characters were designed while Jones attended college in the 1990s; he later founded the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci. The characters were featured in Jones' and the collective's animations and comics before the creator pitched a pilot to Adult Swim featuring the trio. The network's executives referred Jones to Cartoon Network, who commissioned a series featuring the same characters. The series was produced in Adobe <b>Flash,</b> <b>with</b> around fifteen animators employed at Cartoon Network Studios and the co-production of Mirari Films.|$|E

25|$|The {{dangers of}} viewing explosions behind window glass were known of before the Atomic Age began, being a common source of injury and death from large {{chemical}} explosions. The Halifax Explosion of 1917, an ammunition ship exploding {{with the energy}} of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT, injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who stayed behind and looked out of their windows after seeing a bright <b>flash,</b> <b>with</b> 200 blinded by broken glass when the slower moving blast arrived. Every window {{in the city of}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shattered in this catastrophe of human error.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the front amber side marker lights may be wired to <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|E
25|$|As thermal {{radiation}} travels, more or less, {{in a straight}} line from the fireball (unless scattered) any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the exposed area outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a weather phenomenon as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the <b>flash,</b> <b>with</b> radiant energy then reaching burn sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of perfect visibility and therefore zero scattering. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few, if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun's infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open {{is just a matter of}} being protected from the explosion's flash energy.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the year}} ended June 1908 the wick burners were {{replaced}} by a Chance incandescent petroleum vapour burner and the light output was increased from 45,000 to 200,000 candle power. [...] This was increased to 327,000 candles in February 1927 and the current mercury float pedestal and clockwork (now electrified) mechanism was installed in March 1929. [...] At the same time, the light characteristic was changed to a 0.4 second <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> a 4.6 second eclipse. [...] The revolution time was thus 40 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|Fox is {{credited}} with writing the first three of six stories in the inaugural issue of Flash Comics (Jan. 1940), including the debut of the titular character, The <b>Flash.</b> <b>With</b> a hero described as a [...] "modern-day Mercury", the title feature saw college student Jay Garrick imbued with superhuman speed after inhaling hard water vapors. The character went on to appear {{in a host of}} forties comics, including All Star, Comic Cavalcade, The Big All-American Comic Book, and his own titles, Flash Comics and All-Flash.|$|E
2500|$|The group's {{personnel}} in Vietnam adopted a variant <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> an added diagonal yellow stripe with three narrow red over-stripes (inspired by {{the flag of}} South Vietnam) from 1964 to 1970. The reason was that the group had a black flash bordered in white, like a funerary armband – making it look like the US {{had given up on}} their allies. From 1970 to 1985 it was adopted by the entire Group; the yellow and red stripes were officially supposed to indicate the 5th Group's creation from personnel drawn from the 1st and 3rd Groups. It reverted to the plain black flash on 16 January 1985. On 23 March 2016, the 5th Special Forces Group changed over to the Vietnam-era flash to pay respect to the unit's history ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 the Roadmaster {{could only}} be ordered as the well {{equipped}} Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling.

On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright <b>flash</b> <b>with</b> ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.|$|E
