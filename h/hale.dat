5|$|The {{settlements}} of <b>Hale</b> and <b>Hale</b> Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} <b>Hale</b> Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant <b>Hale.</b> During this era the land around <b>Hale</b> and <b>Hale</b> Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century <b>Hale</b> Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring <b>Hale</b> as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of <b>Hale</b> Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E
