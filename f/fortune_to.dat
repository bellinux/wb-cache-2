5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Born {{to a rich}} {{industrial}} family, Beecham {{began his}} career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at Covent Garden, Drury Lane and His Majesty's Theatre with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were Richard Strauss's Elektra, Salome and Der Rosenkavalier and three operas by Frederick Delius.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when he ran}} for {{governor}} in 1826, Edwards had the good <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} pregnant once, Catherine had {{no trouble}} doing so again. She may have owed her change of <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> the physician Jean Fernel, who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, Elisabeth. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future Charles IX (born 27 June 1550); the future Henry III (born 19 September 1551); and Francis, Duke of Anjou (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the Valois dynasty, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|Anthony {{passed on}} both the castle and a {{considerable}} <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> his son, yet another Sir Edward Hungerford, in 1657. After his marriage, Edward enjoyed an income of around £8,000 (£1,110,000) a year, making him a very wealthy man. Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed to the throne on Charles's death, and after {{the discovery of the}} Rye House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might be used in a possible revolt.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> promote opera.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E

To achieve this, he becomes {{the leader of the}} Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller, the Jackal and Gaunt (Mendel Stromm, returned from the dead as a cyborg), all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Peter Parker. It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that he is actually a clone of himself created by the Jackal, while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – is actually the original.|$|E

50|$|The Great American Fortune Cookie Novel is {{a romance}} made by collaging {{together}} more than 2,000 different <b>fortune</b> cookie <b>fortunes</b> <b>to</b> tell the story.

The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, but in practice it would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E
5|$|A Thanksgiving Surprise is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Jack Clyde, {{a young man who}} lives a vain and idle life in the city with his rich friends.

5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> prepare for a rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live {{out the rest of}} his life under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E

5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
5|$|The game's prologue sees Garrett, the protagonist, {{describing}} his youth as a homeless orphan on the City's streets. He is caught {{while attempting to}} pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals {{himself to be a}} Keeper. Impressed by Garrett's ability to see him, he offers him the chance to join his order. Garrett accepts, but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery. Years later, Garrett works as a thief, and is under pressure to join a crime ring. As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee, he is targeted for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez. Garrett evades the assassins, and robs Ramirez's mansion in retaliation. Following this, he is approached by a woman named Viktoria—the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett's theft from Ramirez. He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine, an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City. After Garrett completes the mission, Viktoria takes him to Constantine, who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test. Constantine offers him a <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> steal The Eye—a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral.|$|E
