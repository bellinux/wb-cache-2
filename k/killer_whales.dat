5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in summer. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E

5000|$|Six species, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "blackfish", are dolphins commonly called whales: the <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the melon-headed <b>whale,</b> the pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and the two species of pilot whales, but they are classified under the family Delphinidae.|$|R
5|$|The <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> {{is one of}} 35 {{species in}} the oceanic dolphin family, which first {{appeared}} about 11 million years ago. The <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.|$|R

5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> none have been fatal. In one instance, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> captive <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest Coast feature <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{as the most powerful}} animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.|$|E
5000|$|Stimulus {{enhancement}} - Individuals {{become interested}} in an object from watching others interact with it. Increased interest in an object may result in object manipulation, which facilitates new object-related behaviors by trial-and-error learning. For example, a young <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> might {{become interested in}} playing with a sea lion pup after watching other whales toss the sea lion pup around. After playing with the pup, the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> may develop foraging behaviors appropriate to such prey. In this case, the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> did not learn to prey on sea lions by observing other whales do so, but rather the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> became intrigued after observing other whales play with the pup. After the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> became interested, then its interactions with the sea lion resulted in behaviors that provoked future foraging efforts.|$|R
50|$|The large toothed whales of Maine {{include the}} beluga, beaked <b>whale,</b> false <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> grampus, <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> {{northern}} bottlenose whale, pygmy sperm whale, short-finned pilot whale, sperm whale, and the long-finned pilot whale.|$|R
500|$|The term [...] "whale" [...] is {{sometimes}} used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises, {{acting as a}} synonym for Cetacea. Six species of dolphins have the word [...] "whale" [...] in their name, collectively known as blackfish: the <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the melon-headed <b>whale,</b> the pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the false <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and the two species of pilot whales, {{all of which are}} classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins). Each species has a different reason for it, for example, the <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> was named [...] "Ballena asesina" [...] by Spanish sailors, which translates directly to [...] "whale assassin" [...] or [...] "whale killer", but is more often translated to [...] "killer whale".|$|R
5|$|Dialects of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{not only}} {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting <b>Killer</b> <b>Whales</b> in Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of <b>Killer</b> <b>Whales</b> in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two <b>Killer</b> <b>Whales</b> captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
5|$|<b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} example was the <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Bowhead whales of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock {{harvested}} by Alaskan Eskimos {{were examined}} for scars from <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and ship-collision injuries. We {{estimated that the}} frequency of scars from <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> attacks ranged from 4. 1 % to 7. 9 % (depending on our confidence that the whale was properly examined) while about 1 % exhibited scars from ship collisions. The frequency of <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> scars was considerably lower than for bowhead whales of the Davis Strait stock and for other baleen whales where data are available, and was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) for whales < 13 m. Patterns for both types of scars were quite similar to those reported for other cetacean species. Spaces between rake marks were {{within the range of}} interdental measurements from four <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> skulls.

5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for <b>killer</b> <b>whales,</b> and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{of known}} records of {{commercial}} hunting of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{date to the}} 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, {{and the difficulty of}} taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are apex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.|$|E
50|$|They are {{extremely}} intermediate between both parents. Since a bottlenose may have about 88 teeth and a false <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> has about 44, a wholphin will have 66. They {{are smaller than}} a false <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> but are larger than a normal bottlenose.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{retrospective}} data on naval sonar activity and prey abundance {{were correlated with}} <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> sightings within a fjord basin in northern Norway. In addition, passive acoustic and visual marine mammal surveys were conducted before, during, and after a specific navy exercise in 2006. Herring abundance was the main factor affecting <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> presence. Naval sonar, either operational navy sonar exercises (Flotex) or experimental sonar activity (CEE) alone, did not explain <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> occurrence. However, naval sonar activity {{during a period of}} low prey availability seemed to have had a negative effect on <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> presence. We conclude that the level of reaction to sonar can be influenced by multiple factors, including availability of prey. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea...|$|R
50|$|The now-extinct {{species is}} related to the modern <b>killer</b> <b>whale.</b> It was {{described}} based on an incomplete skull found in Italy, which lacks the rear and left side, but had the back side. It had 28 teeth in each jaw, unlike the current orca which has on average 24 teeth in each jaw. This specimen could be 4 metres long and had the appearance of a small <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> so it could be a transitional species between early dolphins and the modern <b>killer</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|R
5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> along with other marine mammals. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
5|$|Wild <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are not {{considered}} a threat to humans, {{but there have been}} cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> are apex predators, {{meaning that}} they {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. <b>Killer</b> <b>whales</b> hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E

5|$|The {{only known}} {{predator}} of the fin whale is the killer whale, {{with at least}} 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale {{for over an hour}} before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw. In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.|$|E
