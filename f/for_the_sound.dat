5|$|Leslie never advertised his speakers. After {{demonstrating a}} {{prototype}} with Bob Mitchell, an organist with radio station KFI in Los Angeles, a contract {{was made to}} install another prototype in the station's studios, where Mitchell {{would be the only}} organist authorized to use it. Mitchell was so impressed that he tried to patent the speaker, but discovered that he could not. Soon afterwards, Mitchell became an organist with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and played a Hammond with the Leslie on its shows, ensuring national exposure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b> The Leslie was subsequently a standard component of several notable jazz organists, including Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott. Graham Bond was the first notable British organist to play a Hammond through a Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b> It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Digital Devil Saga was principally {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, {{who had worked}} on multiple previous Megami Tensei titles. Some tracks from the first game were composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited storage space of the CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> compression, Meguro used ATRAC3 compression software. Using the software, Meguro was able to fit in high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he needed to make some compromises on tracks.|$|E
5|$|Two English-language dubs of Danger: Diabolik were produced, both {{featuring}} {{the voices of}} Law, Mell and Terry-Thomas. The original English version, used for the film's theatrical and DVD release, presented the remaining cast dubbed with predominantly British accents. The second version, used for the film's VHS and LaserDisc release (as well as its showing on Mystery Science Theater 3000), was created when the original sound elements for the dubbed version (aside {{from those of the}} three aforementioned performers) were believed to be lost; the non-English-speaking actors were dubbed with American accents. This version also greatly remixed the audio levels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> effects and music, and dropped the Danger: from the original English version's title due to using an Italian print. The audio masters for the original English version were eventually recovered by Kim Aubry of American Zoetrope, who produced Paramount's DVD release.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b> Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E

5|$|Pilotwings was {{developed}} by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD), a team consisting {{of members of the}} company's Research & Development divisions, under the leadership of producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo EAD completed Pilotwings and two other games (Super Mario World and F-Zero) within 15 months of the debut of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Pilotwings was released in Japan on December 21, 1990, one month after the system's launch, and was later released in North America in August 1991 as a launch title. The game's musical score was composed by Soyo Oka, while her superior Koji Kondo was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> programming and the helicopter theme. Six tracks from the game, including a rearranged version of the skydiving theme, appeared on the Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music album, released in Japan on March 4, 1992. Six piano-arranged versions of songs from the game were included on the Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music: Fun Together with Beyer CD, which was released in Japan on November 30, 1993.|$|E
5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E

5|$|Three former Sounds {{players have}} also managed <b>the</b> <b>Sounds.</b> Seven games into the 1985 season, Leon Roberts, {{who started the}} season as a Nashville outfielder, became <b>the</b> acting manager <b>for</b> seven games due to manager Lee Walls coming down with an illness. Roberts was {{replaced}} by Gordon Mackenzie and returned to playing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sounds.</b> After later retiring from playing, Roberts was hired to manage the 1986 team. Wayne Garland, who pitched <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> in 1982, managed the team briefly during the 1988 managerial shuffle. Marty Brown managed <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> from 2001 to 2002 after having played for Nashville in 1988 and 1989.|$|R
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

25|$|She {{took a job}} as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> of Music, {{early in}} 1960. During the run of the play, she heard that the casting {{director}} was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job. Although the director felt she was not right for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her résumé when looking for other work.|$|E
25|$|The letter Digamma (Ϝ) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> /w/ was {{generally}} used only in those local scripts where {{the sound was}} still in use in the spoken dialect. During the archaic period, this includes most of mainland Greece (except Attica), as well as Euboea and Crete. In Athens and in Naxos it was apparently used only in the register of poetry. Elsewhere, i.e. {{in most of the}} Aegean islands and the East, the sound /w/ was already absent from the language.|$|E
25|$|Cary Grant said of Stewart's acting technique:He had {{the ability}} to talk naturally.
