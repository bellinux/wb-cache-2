The word yayin was used both as a <b>generic</b> <b>word</b> for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh.

25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock {{at a meeting}} of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the <b>generic</b> <b>word</b> had become so widely associated with being sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate person or a boring platitude uttered by such a person.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of [...] "foreign equivalents," [...] a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark.

No merchant may obtain the exclusive right over a trademark registration if that exclusivity would prevent competitors from designating a product as what it is in the language their customers know best." [...] Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc.The second rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of international comity":"Because United States companies would be hamstrung in international trade if foreign countries granted trademark protection to generic English words, the United States reciprocates and refuses trademark protection to generic foreign words." [...] Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc.However, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure ("TMEP") states that the test for applying {{the doctrine of}} foreign equivalents is [...] "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an [...] "ordinary American purchaser" [...] refers to the [...] "significant portion of consumers" [...] who speak both English and the relevant foreign language. In the case In re Joint Stock Co. [...] "Baik ," [...] 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310, 0.22% was accepted as a significant portion of consumers in the United States.

60|$|York {{is another}} town {{which had a}} narrow escape of {{becoming}} Yorchester. Its Roman name was Eburacum, which the English queerly rendered as Eoforwic, by a very interesting piece of folks-etymology. Eofor is old English for a boar, and wic for a town; so our rude ancestors metamorphosed the Latinised Celtic name into this familiar and significant form, much as our own sailors turn the Bellerophon into the Billy Ruffun, and the Anse des Cousins into the Nancy Cozens. In the same way, I have known an illiterate Englishman speak of Aix-la-Chapelle as Hexley Chapel. To the name, thus distorted, our forefathers of course added the <b>generic</b> <b>word</b> for a Roman town, and so made the cumbrous title of Eoforwic-ceaster, which is the almost universal form in the earlier parts of the English Chronicle. This {{was too much of}} a mouthful even for the hardy Anglo-Saxon, so we soon find a disposition to shorten it into Ceaster on the one hand, or Eoforwic on the other. Should the final name be Chester or York?--that was the question. Usage declared in favour of the more distinctive title. The town became Eoforwic alone, and thence gradually declined through Evorwic, Euorwic, Eurewic, and Yorick into the modern York. It is curious to note that some of these intermediate forms very closely approach the original Eburac, which must have been the root of the Roman name. Was the change partly due to the preservation of the older sound on the lips of Celtic serfs? It is not impossible, for marks of British blood are strong in Yorkshire; and Nennius confirms the idea by calling the town Kair Ebrauc.|$|E

But Lucy Robarts has to play a forward part in this little drama, and those who care for such matters must be made to understand something of her form and likeness. When last we mentioned her as appearing, though not in any prominent position, at her brother's wedding, she was only sixteen; but now, {{at the time of her}} father's death, somewhat over two years having since elapsed, she was nearly nineteen. Laying aside for the sake of clearness that indefinite term of girl--for girls are girls from the age of three up to forty-three, if not previously married--dropping that <b>generic</b> <b>word,</b> we may say that then, at that wedding of her brother, she was a child; and now, at the death of her father, she was a woman. Nothing, perhaps, adds so much to womanhood, turns the child so quickly into a woman, as such death-bed scenes as these. Hitherto but little had fallen to Lucy to do in the way of woman's duties. Of money transactions she had known nothing, beyond a jocose attempt to make her annual allowance of twenty-five pounds cover all her personal wants--an attempt which was made jocose by the loving bounty of her father. Her sister, who was three years her elder--for John came in between them--had managed the house; that is, she had made the tea and talked to the house-keeper about the dinners. But Lucy had sat at her father's elbow, had read to him of evenings when he went to sleep, had brought him his slippers and looked after the comforts of his easy chair. All this she had done as a child; but when she stood at the coffin head, and knelt at the coffin side, then she was a woman.|$|E
