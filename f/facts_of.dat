5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|For the post-Fleming {{continuation}} Bond authors, Leiter {{has also}} {{appeared on a}} periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, {{who is also a}} CIA officer (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of his novels, including The <b>Facts</b> <b>of</b> Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver—both contained the character.|$|E
50|$|Answers to {{questions}} <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{are determined by}} a trier <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> such as a jury, or a judge. In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, appellate courts generally do not consider appeals based on errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> (errors in answering a question <b>of</b> <b>fact).</b> Rather, the findings <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the first venue are usually given great deference by appellate courts.|$|R

This annotation, like other annotations in the baptismal register, such as those of marriage or ordination, was unrelated to the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the baptism: it was not a [...] "debaptism" [...] (a term sometimes used journalistically): the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> having been baptized remained a fact, and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a seal or character that [...] "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> defection".|$|R

5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E
5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> the case.|$|E

5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting conversion narrative; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition. In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E
