5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity profile is linear because the <b>fluid</b> <b>temperature</b> is constant. When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity profile is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the <b>fluid</b> <b>temperature</b> be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
25|$|The {{indicator}} {{method was}} further developed by replacing the indicator dye with heated or cooled <b>fluid.</b> <b>Temperature</b> changes rather than dye concentration are measured at {{sites in the}} circulation; this method is known as thermodilution. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) introduced to clinical practice in 1970, {{also known as the}} Swan-Ganz catheter, provides direct access to the right heart for thermodilution measurements. Continuous, invasive, cardiac monitoring in intensive care units has been mostly phased out. The PAC remains useful in right-heart study done in cardiac catheterisation laboratories.|$|E

25|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working <b>fluid.</b> <b>Temperature</b> increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer.|$|E

2500|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{susceptible}} to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk <b>fluid</b> <b>temperature.</b> Low fluid velocities (less than 3ft/s) allow suspended solids to settle on the heat exchange surface. Cooling water is typically on the tube side of a shell and tube exchanger because it's easy to clean.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that temperature, pressure, sulfur {{fugacity}} (fS 2), and oxygen fugacity (fO 2) influence the Fe content of sphalerite. We present compositional in situ data on sphalerite from submarine volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) ores of hydrothermal vents from different plate tectonic settings and with variable host-rock compositions. Sphalerite from sediment-hosted vents has systematically higher S contents and Fe/Zn ratios than those of the sediment-starved vents, reflecting an influence of fS 2 and fO 2 on Fe partitioning between fluid and sphalerite. The Fe/Zn ratios of sphalerite from sediment-starved vent systems apparently increase systematically with the <b>fluid</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the corresponding vents. We conclude that the composition of sphalerite can be used to (1) distinguish between sediment-hosted and sediment-starved hydrothermal processes, and (2) estimate minimum <b>fluid</b> <b>temperatures</b> of sphalerite precipitation from inactive sediment-starved hydrothermal vent sites and fossil VHMS deposits...|$|R

Avoiding the CHF is an engineering problem in heat transfer applications, such as nuclear reactors, where fuel plates must not be allowed to overheat.
