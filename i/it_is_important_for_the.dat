5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In order to avoid additional types of singularity, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manifold to be convex at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull, as defined using geodesic convexity. The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the {{development}} of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (NO). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|E

PKU-affected women themselves are not at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.|$|E

Consumption of 1,500–1,800 calories per day could coincide with a weight loss of 450grams (one pound) per week. While mothers in famine conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.|$|E
25|$|A fast bowler {{needs to}} take a longer run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, due {{to the need to}} {{generate}} the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery. Fast bowlers will measure their preferred run up in strides and mark the distance from the wicket. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bowler to know exactly how long his or her run-up is because it must terminate behind the popping crease. If the bowler steps on or beyond this, he or she will have bowled a no ball, which affords the batsman immunity from dismissal, adds one run to the batting team's score and forces the bowler to add another ball to the over.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> right components—proteins and other molecules— {{to be in the}} right place at the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, making sense of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E

25|$|The Indian violin, while {{essentially}} the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa–pa (do–sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as C–G–C–G or A–E–A–E. The tonic sa (do) is not fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right foot {{out in front of}} them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well {{due to the nature of}} Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left hand, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> violin to be in a steady, unmoving position.|$|E
