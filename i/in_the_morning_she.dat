5|$|Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on February 27, 1897, and officially {{abolished}} the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen {{to leave her}} palace at 1:30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily, swigging rum directly from the bottle in an uncustomarily coarse fashion. At Toamasina on March 6, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen's fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the illegitimate child of a French soldier.|$|E
25|$|Departing for Leyte on 11 October 1944, Remey {{passed the}} {{northern}} tip of Dinagat Island {{on the night}} of 19/20 October. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> screened her charges, landing craft, to the assault area, then took up station in lower Surigao Strait. Through the 24th, she continued her anti-small boat and antiaircraft patrols, then prepared to meet an enemy surface force reported standing toward the southern entrance to Surigao Strait.|$|E
25|$|Deux Amis left Jersey on 23 May and at 3:30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>she</b> hit a rock. Despite {{efforts to}} save her, water entered the ship {{faster than the}} pumps could remove it. After the {{passengers}} left in a boat, Willson decided to run her ashore, which he did. As a result, there were no casualties. While Deux Amis was in distress at sea, local fishing boats came to help; once she ran ashore, the local populace gave priority to plundering rather than rescue. When Captain Green of the North Hants militia heard what was happening, he and his officers sent a strong detachment to enforce order.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} was built during 1735—1740 C.E., {{and was used}} by Sharf-un-Nisa Begam as a meditation chamber during her lifetime. Sharf-un-Nisa Begam had the structure constructed as a place for her to read <b>the</b> Quran <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings.</b> <b>She</b> climbed up and descended from the structure {{by means of a}} wooden ladder. After the death, the meditation chamber was converted into her tomb, so that even in death, she could remain in purdah and out of view of unrelated men.|$|R
25|$|Her {{first period}} of {{education}} was at Liqing primary school. This school {{was one of}} several schools which accepted female students in Putian. Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

She is sometimes called [...] by her younger brother and Chizuru. She makes her first appearance in chapter two of the manga, but is not named until volume two. She is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone's friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. Sasa acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and tries not to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with Yoshino since pre-school, and later becomes close with Chizuru. Sasa is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Tilson was the rector of Ditton from 1679–1702 {{and was in}} {{correspondence}} with the Protestant cleric Richard Baxter. In one letter Tilson described how a woman from Rochester had gone to her father's house in West Malling where she died on 4 June 1691. While on her death bed, at two o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> appeared as an apparition to a nurse in Rochester, some nine miles away, where her children were being looked after. It had been the dying woman's wish to see her children before she died {{but she had been}} persuaded not to travel because of her ill health. Baxter included this account in his subsequent book The Certainty of the Worlds of the Spirits published in the same year. Tilson died in 1750 and his memorial in St. Peter's AD Vincula Church records a bequest he made to the poor of [...] "£100 in money, the yearly produce to be distributed annually on the feasts of All Saints and the Purification, in wood and wheat" [...] (see inscription in photograph).|$|E

2500|$|On 22 December Bunker Hill sailed into Grand Cul De Sac Bay, Saint Lucia at night.

2500|$|Liz has {{a rather}} satirical sense of humor. She has {{frequently}} {{been shown to}} be a stress eater, a trait she shares with Jack. Despite the fact that she often ingests high-amounts of junk food on a daily basis, she seems to keep her weight under control, perhaps because she {{does not seem to have}} proper meals. According to Fey, the character is not bulimic; [...] "she just likes to eat". Liz does have some knowledge of cooking, though she admits to only using her oven to warm her jeans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> is allergic to both dogs and cats, as well as [...] "anything warm and adorable". However, she does believe her allergy to dogs is psychosomatic, as she mentions that a dog bit her during the time of her first period.|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Phillips holds {{a dinner}} for adults, {{inviting}} Cope to pair with {{the daughter of}} a banking family. Cope disappoints her, reacting to the presence of prominent elders with [...] "a caution that almost became expressiveness."(119) Cope takes ill, nearly faints, and fears he has appeared a weakling. At Mrs. Phillips' insistence he spends the night: [...] "he felt greatly subordinated; he wished that he might have capitulated to a man."(126) When Cope and Amy walk to campus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> thinks it [...] "a privilege...curtailed much too soon,"(129) while he would rather have walked alone. Foster's reaction to Cope's fainting is [...] "as if a shaping ideal had dissipated. Or as if a trace of weakness in one seemingly so young and strong was not altogether unacceptable as a source of consolation."(129) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> quickly steps out of her room into the outhouses and peers out to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her while gasping for air. [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|That weather {{turned into}} a violent nor'easter, a storm with gale force winds out of the east and northeast, which forced the vessel dangerously close to the {{breaking}} waves along the shoals of Cape Cod.

The 60+ cannon on board ripped through the overturned decks of the ship and quickly broke it apart, scattering parts of the ship, 102 human bodies, and thousands of objects over a [...] length of coast. One of the two surviving members of Bellamy's crew, Thomas Davis, testified in his subsequent trial that [...] "In {{a quarter of an hour}} after the ship struck, the Mainmast was carried by the board, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>she</b> was beat to pieces." ...|$|E
