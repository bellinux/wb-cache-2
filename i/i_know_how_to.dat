500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do. What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E

500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was {{assembled}} {{to carry out the}} sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infantería de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father {{was a member of the}} Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofresí refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. Richard Wheeler said that the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Cofresí's last words were reportedly, [...] "I have killed hundreds with my own hands, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> die. Fire!" ...|$|E
500|$|Before any {{director}} {{was attached to}} Hard Target, Universal Pictures saw the film as a potential vehicle for actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had already been {{a huge fan of}} Woo's films and arranged to meet with him in Hong Kong where the two got along despite both Woo and Van Damme's difficulty with their English. Woo originally wanted actor Kurt Russell for the lead role, but found Russell to be booked for two years with other film projects. On working with Van Damme, Woo stated that he was [...] "sure of [...] abilities and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make an actor look good on screen, make him look like a hero. I thought I could do the same for Van Damme". Despite early misgivings of working with Van Damme, Woo changed many action scenes in the film to make them more spectacular on finding that Van Damme was up for it. While working with Van Damme, Woo stated that Van Damme had [...] "a pretty big ego, but he's still professional and always tries to do a good job." [...] Woo had some control over the film's casting including casting minor characters and finding a cinematographer. Actress Yancy Butler was cast as Natasha Binder in her feature film debut. The role led Butler to other starring roles in action films such as Drop Zone [...] and Fast Money. Actor Lance Henriksen accepted the role of Emil Fouchon stating he was a great fan of Woo, noting that his earlier films [...] "were so creative, so balletic, and had this incredible philosophy in them. The violence was only a container for the philosophy".|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E

Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place where}} you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life.

He turned in his resignation in the following month after series of critical statements he made {{during the course of}} Sejm debate about the condition of the health service in Poland. The explanation for the sudden resignation was that because he is not politician, he did not see capability of reforming the Polish health care system. Czakański said that his resignation was for [...] "personal reasons", but he underscored that [...] "the situation in this area is such that it revolves mainly around politics, and not about issues that can be resolved. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make the reforms, but I can also see the directions these problems are going."
