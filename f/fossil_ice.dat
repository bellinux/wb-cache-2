Fine-grained sand and clay soils pose more of a heaving problem when the surface layer annually thaws and freezes. The route will include five multi-span bridges totalling 1400 m in length.

50|$|Paleontology in Kentucky {{refers to}} paleontological {{research}} occurring within or conducted by {{people from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. Kentucky's abundance of exposed sedimentary rock makes it an ideal source of fossils. The oldest exposed rocks in Kentucky are of Ordovician age. The geologic column of Kentucky also contains rocks deposited during the ensuing periods {{until the end of}} the Pennsylvanian. During this span of time the state was first home to a warm shallow sea home to an abundance and variety of brachiopods, cephalopods, crinoids, and trilobites. During the Devonian, a large reef system formed at what is now the Falls of the Ohio. Swamps covered Kentucky during the ensuing Carboniferous period. Then a gap spans from the start of the Permian to the Pleistocene, although the gap is interrupted by minor deposits of Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. These deposits mainly preserve plant <b>fossils.</b> <b>Ice</b> Age Kentucky was home to short-faced bear, bison, elk, lions, mammoths, mastodons, and giant ground sloths. Local Native Americans interpreted fossils of this age at Big Bone Lick as belonging to ancient monsters killed by benevolent mystical little people. This same fossil deposit would attract attention from major American figures like George Washington, Daniel Boone, and, especially, Thomas Jefferson. Amateur fossil collectors should be aware that they need permission from landowners to prospect legally on private property. Brachiopods are the Kentucky state fossil.|$|R

By the end of the 21st century, temperatures may increase to a level not experienced since the mid-Pliocene, around 3 million years ago.

A potential solution is to substitute the detrimental combustion engines with environmentally friendly proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Such fuel cells have many advantages, including high efficiency, high power density, light weight, low operating temperature and rapid startup. This review paper presents the scientific fundamentals of PEMFC and its development. The effects of important design and operating parameters on the fuel cell performance are discussed. Moreover, comparisons {{with other types of}} fuel cells and hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) are provided.

50|$|During {{the early}} Paleozoic, New Hampshire {{was covered by}} a warm, shallow sea that would come to be {{inhabited}} by creatures like brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, crinoids, and trilobites. Geologic forces raised the local elevation during the Devonian, and local sediments were eroded away from the state rather than deposited, leading to {{a gap in the}} local rock record.

50|$|<b>Fossils</b> of <b>Ice</b> Age leopards in Europe are {{sometimes}} found in caves, where they apparently sought shelter or hid their prey. They generally preferred smaller caves, most likely because larger caves were usually occupied by larger predators such as cave bears, cave lions, or humans. In European Ice Age caves, leopard bones are far rarer {{than those of}} lions, and all currently known fossils belong to adults, suggesting that they rarely, if ever, raised their cubs in caves. Where leopard remains are found in larger caves, they are often found in the cave's deeper recesses, as in Baumann's and Zoolithen Cave in Germany. It is not precisely known which prey species these leopards hunted, although {{they may have been}} similar to modern Persian or snow leopards, which prey on ibex, deer and wild boar. It is likely that leopards scavenged or occasionally killed cave bears during hibernation in their dens. During the cold phases, Late Pleistocene European leopards occurred mainly in mountain or alpine boreal forests or in mountains above the treeline, and were not usually found in the lowland mammoth steppes.|$|R

40|$|Lava-fed deltas are {{extraordinarily}} useful {{indicators of}} <b>fossil</b> water (and <b>ice)</b> levels in glacial, marine, and lacustrine environments. Deltas fed by ‘a‘ā lava {{should be at}} least as common as those sourced in pāhoehoe, yet they have been rarely described. Although facies models for pāhoehoe lava-fed deltas are well established, the architecture and lithofacies of ‘a‘ā-fed equivalents are substantially different and have thus far largely been unrecognized. This can have profound consequences for paleoenvironmental investigations, particularly those attempting to reconstruct past ice sheets. Essential features of ‘a‘ā lava-fed deltas include (1) a subaerial ‘a‘ā lava capping unit comprising massive internal sheet lava overlain by clinkers; (2) a crudely developed subaerial to subaqueous transition (passage zone); (3) a chaotic subaqueous association of abundant lava lobes and hyaloclastite with admixed vesicular, often reddened (oxidized) lava clinkers; and (4) rare subaqueous stratifi cation with predominantly lower dips (~ 10 °– 20 °) than in deltas fed by pāhoehoe lava (~ 25 °– 40 °). We develop a generic facies model and investigate the emplacement conditions of ‘a‘ā lava-fed deltas in order to facilitate the recognition and environmental interpretation of these important sequence types in ancient successions...|$|R
40|$|Previously it {{has been}} shown that diatom <b>fossils</b> {{embedded}} in <b>ice</b> could survive impacts at speeds of up to 5 km s- 1 and peak shock pressures up to 12 GPa. Here we confirm these results using a different technique, with diatoms carried in liquid water suspensions at impact speeds of 2 to 6 km s- 1. These correspond to peak shock pressures of 3. 8 to 19. 8 GPa. We also report on the results of similar experiments using forams, at impact speeds of 4. 67 km s- 1 (when carried in water) and 4. 73 km s- 1 (when carried in ice), corresponding to peak shock pressures of 11. 6 and 13. 1 GPa respectively. In all cases we again find survival of recognisable fragments, with mean fragment size of order 20 – 25 µm. We compare our results to the peak shock pressures that ejecta from giant impacts on the Earth would experience if it subsequently impacted the Moon. We find that 98 % of impacts of terrestrial ejecta on the Moon would have experienced peak pressures less than 20 GPa if the ejecta were a soft rock (sandstone). This falls to 82 % of meteorites if the ejecta were a hard rock (granite). This assumes impacts on a solid lunar surface. If we approximate the surface as a loose regolith, over 99 % of the impacts involve peak shock pressures below 20 GPa. Either way, the results show that a significant fraction of terrestrial meteorites impacting the Moon will do so with peak shock pressures which in our experiments permit the survival of recognisable fossil fragments...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The current {{transport}} sector faces two global problems. The first is climate change, {{due to the}} combustion of fossil fuels, {{and the second is}} resource depletion. From the entire transport sector (road, air and water), private passenger vehicles account for more than 50 % of the emitted greenhouse gasses. The main question is: will there be a sustainable solution for private passenger vehicles in 2050 ? The aim of this research is to find potential bottlenecks when the entire society switches to one singe alternative. For example when we will still be using the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) in 2050 or when we all switch to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV), Biofuel vehicle or perhaps a combination {{in the form of a}} Hybrid vehicle. The definition of a sustainable situation is not to rely on fossil fuels and the demand for resources (material, land, renewable energy) is not larger than the reserves or potential. Current CO 2 emissions (3500 Mton/yr) from the private passenger vehicle sector are expected to increase by a factor 2 according to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. In this scenario, the total amount of vehicles will increase to about 2 billion and the global travelled distances will increase with a factor of 2. 3 by the year 2050. A sustainable CO 2 situation is a reduction of 50 % compared to the 1990 levels, which means 1175 Mt/yr. With the use of fore- and backcasting scenarios, the most important bottlenecks of each alternative are examined. Improving ICE vehicles, for example with direct injection, mass reduction, engine downsizing, variable gearboxes, decreases resource use and total CO 2 emissions by more than 50 %. Unfortunately, these measures can only stabilize current CO 2 emissions in 2050, due to the increase in global travelled kilometers. Furthermore, these vehicles still use <b>fossil</b> fuels. Improved <b>ICE</b> vehicles cannot become a sustainable solution in 2050. When biofuels substitute <b>fossil</b> fuels, <b>ICE</b> vehicles are much cleaner. The potential of 1 st generation biofuels is technically large enough to cover the demand, but emissions of producing it vary enormously and therefore these vehicles cannot become sustainable in 2050. The potential of 2 nd generation biofuels is unfortunately smaller and is therefore not enough to cover the demand. Electric vehicles store their energy in NGA-G lithium batteries (BE vehicles) or in hydrogen (FCE vehicles). The main bottlenecks of BE vehicles are the relatively low energy density of batteries, the accumulated lithium demand and the CO 2 intensity of current electricity production. The lithium reserves are only large enough to produce BE vehicles with a battery that can cover a vehicle range of 400 - 500 km. Charging these batteries with the current electricity mix would only stabilize current CO 2 emissions in 2050. These vehicles can only become sustainable when at least 80 % of the electricity is generated by renewable electricity sources. FCE vehicles do not have a direct resource bottleneck but faces an overall low efficiency (hydrogen production, transport and fuel cell efficiency) of 30 %. For these vehicles, at least 90 % of the electricity has to be generated by renewable electricity sources. Both are within the potential of renewable electricity sources such as wind, water and solar power but large investments have to be made to supply this demand. A Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a combination of a BE vehicle and a combustion engine to extent the range (< 800 km). 82 % of all the annually travelled distances can be covered by the electric powertrain with a relatively small battery (3. 2 kWh = 48 km vehicle range). Therefore the accumulated demand for lithium would be only 2. 2 Mt and can easily be covered by the available reserves bases (32. 5 Mt). However, the CO 2 bottlenecks still remain. Emissions from the ICE powertrain are relatively high and the current electricity mix is not clean enough to charge these batteries in a sustainable way. A solution is that biofuels are used in the ICE powertrain and that the batteries are charged by renewable electricity sources. The advantage of PHE vehicles is the limited demand for lithium, biofuels and renewable electricity sources. Current implementation of the researched alternatives will not give a sustainable situation right now. Therefore something structural has to be changed, for example the CO 2 intensity of current electricity production. PHE vehicles are the best choice for a sustainable passenger transport sector by the year 2050 because of the limited demand of resources that can be covered by the potentials and reserves. A discussion point is that the estimation of lithium reserves has more than doubled in the last two years. Electric vehicles are more energy efficient than a PHE vehicle in combination with biofuels. The actual available lithium reserves are not well known and therefore maybe BE vehicles are the best choice for a sustainable passenger transport sector. Either way, renewable electricity sources are needed to achieve a sustainable private passenger vehicle sector in 2050. ...|$|R

The analysis quantifies use of human and animal muscle power, wind and water power, biomass, harvested <b>ice,</b> <b>fossil</b> fuels, and nuclear power. Historical prices are provided for many energy resources. The analysis reaffirms the importance of innovation in conversion technologies in energy transitions. An increase in energy {{intensity in}} the early 20 th century is explained by diminishing returns to pre-electric manufacturing systems, which produced a transformation in manufacturing. In comparison to similar studies for other countries, the U. S. has generally higher energy intensity. A population-weighted series of heating degree days and cooling degree days partially explains differences in energy intensity. Series are developed for 231 countries and territories with multiple reference temperatures, with a "wet-bulb" series accounting for the effects of humidity. Other variables considered include energy prices, income per capita, and governance indices. A panel regression of thirty-two countries from 1995 to 2010 establishes GDP per capita and share of primary energy as determinants of energy intensity, but fails to establish statistical significance of the climate variables. A group mean regression finds average heating and cooling degree days to be significant predictors of average energy intensity over the study period, increasing energy intensity by roughly 1. 5 kJ per 2005 international dollar for each annual degree day. Group mean regression results explain differences in countries' average energy intensity, but not changes within a country over time. Energy Return on Investment (EROI) influences the economic competitiveness and environmental impacts of an energy resource and is one driver of energy transitions. The EROI of U. S. petroleum production has declined since 1972, with a partial rebound in the 1980 s and 1990 s. External Energy Return (EER), which excludes the consumption of energy from within the resource, falls by two-thirds from 1972 to 2007. A literature review finds the projected EROI of oil shale to be much lower than the EROI of U. S. petroleum production...|$|R
