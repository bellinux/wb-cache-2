5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E

5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied from <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to a {{post in the}} ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started.

If it is a Counter, he MUST take it into <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> If {{it is not a}} Counter, he may choose whether to take it into <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> If the bid winner takes the tile into <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> he {{discards}} face-down some other non-counter tile to take <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> back down to 11 tiles. Thus all counters are always in play.|$|R

He was also awarded the Purple Heart for the burns to <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E

She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta (the five classical elements) in the icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow in one of <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan that had <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet removed surgically {{due to a}} bacterial infection.

5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
