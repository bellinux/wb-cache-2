5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with his teenage daughter.|$|E
5|$|Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all {{the arts}} of war, {{including}} the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E

25|$|Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Man Beren and Elf Lúthien, the {{daughter}} of Thingol, entered Angband and recovered a Silmaril from Morgoth’s crown after Luthien's singing sent <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> It was inherited by their granddaughter Elwing, who joined those dwelling at the Mouths of Sirion.

25|$|Fluffy {{is a giant}} three-headed dog {{provided}} by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone was hidden {{until the end of}} Philosopher's Stone. The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} ending, {{preferred by}} Raimi and Campbell themselves, {{is one in}} which Ash is shown being placed in a cave and given a potion which will put <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for centuries. Echoing his experience in botching the recovery of the Necronomicon, Ash mishandles the specific instructions for the potion, accidentally taking an extra dose after a momentary distraction makes him lose count. Ash awakes and arises from his cave to find himself in a post-apocalyptic future, in which the city of London is in ruins.|$|E
5000|$|All other {{doors are}} locked, however. The Count warns <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> outside the rooms he already knows, {{including}} {{the library and}} the dining room; {{it seems as if}} the Castle has a life of its own: ...|$|R
60|$|He lit {{his pipe}} {{and sat up}} in bed smoking until a knock at the front door at half-past eleven sent <b>him</b> off <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again. Mrs. Scutts, who was sitting downstairs, opened it and {{admitted}} her husband.|$|R

25|$|Halsey {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942 in poor health {{due to the}} extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent {{nearly all of the}} previous six months on the bridge of the carrier Enterprise, directing the Navy's counterstrikes. A debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Gaunt and having lost twenty pounds, he was medically ordered to the Hospital in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Rebus {{finds himself}} {{with a number of}} {{problems}} on his hands. His wayward brother, Michael, has returned to Edinburgh in need of accommodation - with only the box-room in Rebus's flat available. While out drinking, he meets an old army friend, Deek Torrance, who admits to being involved in shady activities, telling Rebus he can get his hands on 'anything from a shag to a shooter'. Rebus spends so long out with Deek that he misses dinner with his girlfriend, Doctor Patience Aitken. Furious, she locks him out of her flat, forcing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in his own flat, on the sofa.|$|E

Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but a JSDF ship stops them and orders them to return Kong to Faro Island. Meanwhile, Godzilla arrives in Japan and begins terrorizing the countryside. Kong wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Reaching the mainland, Kong confronts Godzilla and proceeds to throw giant rocks at Godzilla. Godzilla is not fazed by King Kong's rock attack and uses its atomic breath to burn him. Kong retreats after realizing {{that he is not}} yet ready to take on Godzilla and its atomic breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can {{do nothing}} for him," [...] said the Tin Woodman, sadly; [...] "for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave <b>him</b> here <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last." ...|$|R

25|$|The next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant {{room service}} bill, and {{no sign of}} Gonzo (who has {{returned}} to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears Baker, California, a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning {{that he has a}} suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could get them into, Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.|$|E
500|$|Delilah, however, {{persists}} and Samson finally wears {{down and}} tells Delilah that God supplies his power {{because of his}} consecration to God as a Nazirite, symbolized {{by the fact that}} a razor has never touched his head, and that if his hair is cut off he will lose his strength. [...] Delilah then woos <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> [...] "in her lap" [...] and calls for a servant to shave his hair. [...] Samson loses his strength and he is captured by the Philistines who blind him by gouging out his eyes. [...] They then take him to Gaza, imprison him, and put him to work turning a large millstone and grinding corn.|$|E

60|$|It {{was useless}} for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> <b>To</b> and fro he paced in the starlight. Alone now, with the urgent {{activities}} past for the time, he reverted to the grim and hateful introspection that had haunted his mind.|$|R
500|$|Thrud first {{encounters}} Lymara when he {{sees her}} chasing away a wasp by waving a small cloth from her tower bedroom.

Seeking revenge, Lymara attempts to poison Thrud with a bottle of Acme [...] "Mammoth Poison", but succeeds only in putting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> as part of The Three Tasks of Thrud series of strips.

500|$|Like many of Orbison's songs, [...] "In Dreams" [...] {{rejects the}} verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus {{structure}} {{of the majority of}} rock and roll fare. Instead it mirrors the procession of falling asleep and becoming immersed in an elusive fantasy. It begins like a lullaby with minimal acoustic guitar strums, with Orbison introducing the listener to [...] "A candy-colored clown they call the sandman" [...] half-spoken and half-sung in a Sprechgesang fashion common in operas and other musical theater performances. [...] The sandman puts <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> where he begins singing about dreams of his lover. Drums pick up the rhythm to follow Orbison's lyrics further into subconsciousness, and a piano joins as the lyrics recount how Orbison spends time with her, accompanied by breathy backup singers. Orchestra strings counter his melody that has the effect of representing a singing voice in themselves.|$|E
500|$|Another legend {{tells how}} Zowe Palep, the architect, {{had a vision}} in a dream after the Zhabdrung ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> under a small {{structure}} which contained a statue of the Buddha, known as Dzong Chug [...] "small dzong". In his dream, prompted by the psychic powers of the Zhabdrung, he had a clear vision of a palace for Guru Rinpoche. The vision was imprinted on the architect's mind, enabling him to conceive the plan for the dzong without putting the vision on paper and to build it. On {{the basis of the}} dream vision of the architect, the building of the dzong was started in 1637 and completed in 1638, at the place where the Dzong Chug had existed. During this period, Ngawang Namgyal became the first leader of a unified Bhutan, following his concerted efforts to unify the country into one unit.|$|E

500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.|$|E
500|$|Hollands pitched for the Lakewood Blue Claws of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2011, {{and then}} pitched for Lakewood, the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, the Reading Phillies of the Class AA Eastern League, and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League in 2012. Essentially, Hollands pitched for [...] "whatever minor-league team {{required}} pitching help", which {{in one case}} required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{on the living room}} floor of a shared apartment. Late in the season in Lehigh Valley, he compiled a 9.24 earned run average (ERA) in three starts, and possessed a fastball that reached only , prompting Rod Nichols, then Lehigh Valley's pitching coach, and subsequently the Phillies' bullpen coach, to praise Hollands' work ethic, but opine that his pitching repertoire was insufficiently effective. He had a solid 2013 season with Clearwater and Reading, recording a 1.56ERA in 14 games for Clearwater between May 3 and July 10, and then a 4.06ERA after being promoted to Reading. He then pitched for the Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League after the season, recording a 2.45 ERA. Phillies' officials credited that experience in Venezuelan winner ball as the impetus for his subsequent success. Hollands commented, [...] "I've just gotten better," [...] while Nichols commented, [...] "He found it." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1830, George's {{imminent}} end was apparent.

His weight was recorded to be [...] Attacks of breathlessness due to dropsy forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> upright in a chair, and doctors frequently tapped his abdomen to drain excess fluid. Despite his obvious decline, George was admired for clinging doggedly to life. His will to live and still-prodigious appetite astonished observers; in April 1830, the Duke of Wellington wrote the King had consumed for breakfast [...] "a Pidgeon and Beef Steak Pye...Three parts of a bottle of Mozelle, a Glass of Dry Champagne, two Glasses of Port [...] a Glass of Brandy", followed by a large dose of laudanum. Writing to Maria Fitzherbert in June, the King's doctor, Sir Henry Halford, noted [...] "His Majesty's constitution is a gigantic one, and his elasticity under the most severe pressure exceeds what I have ever witnessed in thirty-eight years' experience." [...] Though George had been under Halford's care since the time of the Regency, the doctor's social ambitions and perceived lack of competence were strongly criticised, with The Lancet labelling Halford's bulletins on the King's health as [...] "utterly and entirely destitute of information", subsequently characterising Halford's treatment of George, which involved administering both opium and laudanum as sedatives, as appearing to lack sense or direction.|$|E
