First, we study how the departure rate is determined by promotion opportunities in the organization. We ask: In structural positions where the promotion rates are low, are the departure rates high, and vice-versa? Second, we distinguish between different types of <b>departures</b> <b>hose</b> that occur or career reasons such as better job options and higher earnings outside the organization hose that occur for personal reasons, such as having to tend {{to the needs of}} one's family; and involuntary departures, that is, dismissals and abolished positions. We attempt to assess which type of departure is most influenced by the presence of promotion opportunities and particular organizational structures. The main findings are: (1) Departure rates are lower in company positions with high promotion rates than in positions with low promotion rates, keeping the level of current achievement constant. This finding suggests that the study of organizational careers and the study of organizational departures need to be integrated. (2) Promotion opportunities in the company have a stronger influence on departures for career-related reasons than on departures for personal reasons. This suggests that organizational opportunity’s structures re more effective in controlling career-related turnover than in influencing other types of terminations...|$|R

Taking {{advantage of the}} small and isolated island of Helgoland in the North Sea, we investigated the stopover and departure behaviour of a nocturnal migrant by using radio telemetry. Special attention was paid particularly to nocturnal behaviour, their departure times within the night, and departure directions. Here, we show that Northern Wheatears,, performed regularly nocturnal exploratory flights on nights before and on departure night, which might be a common behaviour of nocturnal migrants to evaluate meteorological conditions aloft prior to departure. We proposed that migrants being prepared for an endurance flight would depart early in the night {{within a short time}} window, whereas individuals departing with low fuel load would be less prone to take off early. Our data, however, could not support this hypothesis. In respect of the migratory direction, there was a significant correlation between departure direction and <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> load. Northern Wheatears with high <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads headed more towards the north than lean migrants, which departed mostly towards the nearest coastline, i. e. east to south.

40|$|Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992 Am. Nat. 140, 477 - 491) {{presented}} {{a model that}} predicts optimal <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads {{as a function of}} the rate of fuel deposition in time-minimizing migrants. The basis of the model is that the coverable distance per unit of fuel deposited, diminishes with increasing fuel load. This is an effect of the increasing flight costs associated with increasing body mass. Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) found that birds left at lower fuel loads than their model predicted for which they considered various ecological explanations. Alternatively, we hypothesize that the difference between prediction and empirical data might be a result of extra resting metabolic and transport costs associated with an increase in fuel load during stopover. We develop a new version of the Lindstrom & Alerstam (1992) model taking fuel load associated costs during stopover into account. We fit empirical data from rufous hummingbirds Selasphorus rufus (Carpenter el al., 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

40|$|Birds {{migrating}} between widely separated wintering {{and breeding}} grounds may choose {{among a number}} of potential stopover sites by using different itineraries. Our aim is to predict the optimal migration schedule in terms of (1) rates of <b>fuel</b> deposition(2) <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads and (3) stopover site use, when only a handful of such sites are available. We assume that reproductive success depends on the date and fuel load at arrival on the breeding grounds. On migration, the birds face a trade-off between gaining fuel and avoiding predation. To allow the optimal decision at any given moment to depend on the fuel load and the location of the bird, as well as on unpredictability in conditions, we employed stochastic dynamic programming. This technique assumes that the birds know the probability distribution of conditions in all sites, but not the particular realization they will encounter. We examined the consequences of varying aspects of the model, like (1) the shape of the relationship between arrival date and fitness, (2) the presence of stochasticity in fuel deposition rates and wind conditions, and (3) the nature of predation (i. e. whether predation risk depends on the fuel load of the birds or their feeding intensity). Optimal fuel deposition rates are predicted to be constant if there are either only predation risks of maintaining stores or only risks of acquiring fuel stores. If only fuel acquisition is risky, fuel deposition rates can be below maximum, especially if there also is an intermediate best arrival time at the breeding ground. The fuel deposition rate at a site then depends not just on the site's quality but on the qualities of all visited sites. In contrast, rates of fuel deposition are not constant if both the acquisition and the maintenance of fuel stores carry risk. Optimal <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads are just enough to reach the next site if the environment is deterministic and are simply set by the energetic cost of covering the distance. As with time-minimizing models, more fuel than necessary to reach a site is only deposited under very restricted circumstances. Such overloads {{are more likely to be}} deposited if either fuel gains or expenditure are stochastic. The size of overloads is then determined by the variance in fuel gainat the target site and the worst possible conditions during flight. Site use is modified by differences in predation risk between sites and differences in fuel deposition rates. An expression derived to predict site use under time minimization provides agood approximation in state-dependent models. In some cases, the possibility of starvation may influence optimal decisions, even when the probability of starvation under the optimal policy is low. This effect of starvation has also been found in other contexts. VA:IB...|$|R

Mars is often considered as a prominent site for human activity. Martian activities of serious magnitude would benefit from improved means of access for transport from the Martian surface to Earth, and to other destinations in the solar system. A technique being considered to assist launches from Earth’s surface may be applicable to departures from Mars: high speed launch sleds, carrying a winged, Mars departure vehicle to a take-off velocity. Magnetic levitation offers an attractive support system for such sleds. Several types of magnetic suspension are available. Each has differing characteristics that influence their respective applicability to this function. Of these, the passive magnetic system possesses characteristics that appear to make it especially desirable for application to a Martian launch sled. Propulsion could be via reaction devices, making use of Martian resources. The low atmospheric pressure on Mars allows for high sled speeds with only moderate aerodynamic interactions or resistance, compared to Earth. At the same time, the presence of the Martian atmosphere allows for a lifting body ascent, reducing the thrust needed from the departure vehicle’s propulsion system.

Directores de la Tesis: Alberto Olivares González y Ernesto Staffetti GiammariaThe {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to develop optimal control techniques for aircraft trajectory planning looking at reduction of fuel consumption, emissions and overfly charges in flight plans. The calculation of a flight plan involves the consideration of multiple factors. They can be classified as either continuous or discrete, and include nonlinear aircraft performance, atmospheric conditions, wind conditions, airspace structure, amount of <b>departure</b> <b>fuel,</b> and operational constraints. Moreover, multiple differently characterized flight phases {{must be considered in}} flight planning, which typically also involves decision-making processes. The flight planning problem can be regarded as a trajectory optimization problem. The most natural way to address a trajectory optimization problem is using optimal control techniques. One of the main advantages of using optimal control is that it allows the aircraft continuous non-linear dynamics to be considered. The solution to the problem provides the optimal amount of <b>departure</b> <b>fuel,</b> the optimal four dimensional trajectory (horizontal route and the vertical profile over time), speed, consumption and attitude profiles over time, and the corresponding optimal control inputs of the aircraft. The multiphase nature of the problem, the non-linear dynamics of the aircraft, and the introduction of integer variables to model decision-making processes lead to the formulation of a multiphase mixed-integer optimal control problem. The duration of the phases is optimized including the switching times as unknowns of the problem, which is modeled using a direct numerical approach. In particular, a collocation method is employed to transcribe the infinite dimensional optimal control problem into a finite dimensional optimization one, which is solved using a mixed integer nonlinear programming solver. It is shown that the flight planning problem can be effectively tackled using mixedinteger optimal control, considering multiple phases and including decision-making processes. Results show that the efficiency of current flight plans could be substantially improved and that the techniques studied in this thesis have a strong potentiality to be employed in the definition of more efficient flight plans under future operational concepts in air traffic management.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} some theoretical concepts {{based on}} optimality theory {{that may be}} applied to bat migration.

I also consider a criterion for fuel management when bats are migrating between summer and hibernation sites. The overall migration speed is predicted to be 46 km/day for a small (10 -g) bat, and banding recoveries in Nathusius's bat (Pipistrellus nathusii) showed a mean speed of 47 km/day. The timing of migration in bats that minimizes the time spent in migration is considered a result of the trade-off between seasonally increased length of the night (decreased in spring) and reduction of aerial insect abundance.

40|$|We used satellite-tracking {{data from}} {{repeated}} journeys between Europe and West Africa {{by the same}} osprey, Pandion haliaetus, individuals to test whether the timing of migration differs between spring and autumn and whether landmarks and stopover goal areas are important for navigation. The timing of migration varied more in autumn than in spring, owing to significant differences between individuals (related to sex) in autumn migration dates. Autumn journeys were significantly slower than spring journeys because they included more stopover days. The difference {{may be explained by}} environmental conditions restricting the timing of migration in spring, by differences in opportunities to deposit <b>fuel</b> prior to <b>departure,</b> and by differences in expected changes in foraging/fuelling conditions along the route. Flight paths from repeated journeys by the same individual were often 120 - 405 km apart (maximum east-west separation 1400 km). These distances exceed the expected normal range of vision, suggesting that the ospreys did not find their way by following familiar landmarks. Flight paths converged in some regions, indicating the existence of up to three intermediary goal areas along the route of individual birds. Between these goal regions route fidelity was low, and the ospreys could find the next goal region after extensive deviation, presumably by map-based navigation and possibly in combination with path integration.

40|$|Recent {{models have}} worked with the {{assumption}} that birds try to minimize either time, energy or predation risk during migration, or some combination of these. The few empirical studies available have suggested that time minimization may be the most common strategy. One way of distinguishing between strategies is to study the departure decisions of migrating birds. We supplied migrating European robins, Erithacus rubecula, with food ad libitum in the field and monitored their changes in body mass prior to departure. The overall mass gain rate (k(tot), the ratio of daily mass increase to lean mass) of 10 birds using the feeding station was on average 0. 05 (range 0. 03 - 0. 09). <b>Departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads (f(dep), the ratio of fuel mass to lean mass) were on average 0. 53 (range 0. 35 - 0. 66). There was no significant correlation between f(dep) and k(tot), which indicates a strategy of minimizing the energy cost of transport, rather than minimizing time but other aspects of the fuel deposition pattern suggest that time minimization may also be important. Whereas the behaviour of the robins was difficult to interpret in the light of optimal migration strategies, the importance of weather was striking. The robins selected the best weather conditions (tail wind, high air pressure and no precipitation) within the likely period of departure.

40|$|Birds usually migrate by {{alternating}} flight bouts and stopovers for refueling. The decision when {{to leave}} a stopover place {{is of paramount importance}} for the success of migration. Despite its importance, little is known about which factors influence the departure decision. Using capture [...] recapture data of passerines from 3 stopover sites, we investigate by capture [...] recapture models whether this decision is dependent on actual fuel stores and fuel deposition rates. Individuals that accumulated fuel stores at medium rates departed later than individuals that either lost fuel stores during their stopover or able to increase their fuel stores quickly. This pattern was consistent among all sites. The departure decision was not dependent on actual fuel stores at 2 stopover sites. At the site facing an ecological barrier, emigration probability increased with increasing fuel stores, indicating that birds wait until they reach a threshold of fuel stores before departing. There was a positive correlation between <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> load and fuel deposition rate at all sites, which is in accordance with the time-minimizing hypothesis. These results suggest that the decision to depart from a stopover site is based on rather simple behavioral rules: birds that lose fuel stores or that increase fuel stores at a high rate would leave a site quickly, whereas birds increasing fuel stores at intermediate rates would stay for a longer time. The departure decision is shaped also by the position of the stopover site in relation to the next one and may be affected further by environmental factors.

40|$|We use {{a dynamic}} {{optimization}} model {{to assess the}} consequences of habitat loss at migratory stopover sites. We emphasize costs birds face during stopover (e. g. costs of gaining energy), the timing of site use and the behavioural rules birds might use to implement migratory strategies. Behavioural rules may be flexible enough that birds can still produce optimal behaviour in the changed environment, or the rules may result in suboptimal behaviour. If birds behave optimally in the altered environment, habitat loss on the wintering ground has the highest impact, because this site, unlike the intermediate stopover sites, cannot be skipped if the quality drops below a threshold. If birds continue to use the old behavioural rules that now result in suboptimal behaviour, we can distinguish two cases. Birds can continue to use a constant foraging behaviour that was optimal in the unaltered environment under many circumstances. Then the effects of habitat loss are proportional {{to the length of}} stay before habitat loss and the <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> load from a site. However, the effects of habitat loss do not depend on the location of the site within the network. In some circumstances birds are expected to forage with intensities that are below maximum. If birds use the foraging behaviour that is appropriate for a given fuel load, time and site but inappropriate for the altered fuel gain, then changes at sites close to the breeding ground have a greater impact than more distant sites. Finally we discuss the importance of sites that are not used before habitat loss. If birds behave optimally these sites may be used in an altered environment and can buffer against habitat loss at other sites...|$|R
40|$|Many {{migrating}} birds divide their journeys into nocturnal flights interspersed by stopovers {{where they}} build up energy reserves (fuel) for subsequent flights. Given {{the difficulty in}} monitoring fuel loads of individual migrants over long distances, theoretical models are often used to interpret observed relations between <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads (DFLs) and fuel deposition rates (FDRs) {{in the context of}} time-minimised migration. Models applicable to nocturnal migration have hitherto considered only the departure decision, i. e. ignored interim stopover possibilities before fuel loads are depleted. This results in ‘risk-prone’ migratory schedules in terms of choice of stopover. In this study we assess ‘risk-averse’ behaviour, whereby nocturnal migrants minimise migration time by adjusting not only DFLs to experienced and expected FDRs, but also stopping fuel loads (SFLs), below which they stop to refuel at high-quality sites. We developed analytical formulae to solve for maximal risk-prone and risk-averse migration speeds in modelled environments comprised of two stopover qualities (high- and low-quality), and a constant probability of encountering a high-quality site (encounter probability). Risk-aversion was beneficial to migration speeds in over 99 % of the modelled environments, with median ratios of risk-averse to risk-prone migration speeds ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 8. Among modelled environments, this benefit increased with increasing FDRs at high-quality sites, and was highest with low probabilities of encountering high-quality sites. Time-minimising risk-averse DFLs at low-quality sites were minimal in nearly all modelled environments, and whenever encounter probabilities were low, risk-averse SFLs typically indicated that migrants should stop immediately on encountering high-quality sites. Modelled fuel loads in environments with high and low encounter probabilities resembled observed fuel loads of migratory populations with ubiquitous and scarce food availability, respectively. This study demonstrates the benefits of risk-averse exploitation of variable resources, presents a new approach to model time-minimised migration in heterogeneous environments and emphasises the importance of premium stopover sites to nocturnally migrating birds...|$|R
40|$|Long-distance {{migratory birds}} are declining {{globally}} and migration {{has been identified}} as the primary source of mortality in this group. Despite this, our lack of knowledge of habitat use and quality at stopovers, i. e., sites where the energy for migration is accumulated, remains a barrier to designing appropriate conservation measures, especially in tropical regions. There is therefore an urgent need to assess stopover habitat quality and concurrently identify efficient and cost-effective methods for doing so. Given that fuel deposition rates directly influence stopover duration, <b>departure</b> <b>fuel</b> load, and subsequent speed of migration, they are expected to provide a direct measure of habitat quality and have the advantage of being measurable through body-mass changes. Here, we examined seven potential indicators of quality, including body-mass change, for two ecologically distinct Neotropical migratory landbirds on stopover in shade-coffee plantations and tropical humid premontane forest during spring migration in Colombia: (1) rate of body-mass change; (2) foraging rate; (3) recapture rate; (4) density; (5) flock size; (6) age and sex ratios; and (7) body-mass distribution. We found higher rates of mass change in premontane forest than in shade-coffee in Tennessee Warbler Oreothlypis peregrina, a difference that was mirrored in higher densities and body masses in forest. In Gray-cheeked Thrush Catharus minimus, a lack of recaptures in shade-coffee and higher densities in forest, also suggested that forest provided superior fueling conditions. For a reliable assessment of habitat quality, we therefore recommend using a suite of indicators, taking into account each species' ecology and methodological considerations. Our results also imply that birds stopping over in lower quality habitats may spend a longer time migrating and require more stopovers, potentially leading to important carryover effects on reproductive fitness. Evaluating habitat quality is therefore imperative prior to defining the conservation value of newly identified stopover regions...|$|R

In view of the operation of these boats at least 2 - 3 weeks are needed to complete one voyage of fishing. However, the concept of fish preservation still remains conventional by using the ice cold fish hold that was used for small multi day boats.

Full capacity offish hold cannot be used for storing fish b. High <b>fuel</b> consumption at <b>departure</b> condition to carry considerable amount of ice. c.
