25|$|In severe cases, the {{withdrawal}} reaction or protracted withdrawal may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as mania, schizophrenia, agitated depression, panic disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and complex partial seizures and, especially at high doses, seizure disorders.

Pre-existing disorder or other causes typically do not improve, whereas symptoms of protracted withdrawal gradually improve over the ensuing months. For this reason at least six months should have elapsed after benzodiazepines cessation before re-evaluating the symptoms and updating a diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the recognition of facial expressions in patients with a <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is well documented that in different psychiatric disorders (e. g., depression, schizophrenia) patients may show an altered processing of emotions. However, in <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> emotion recognition has not been studied. Methods. 24 Patients with <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and 26 healthy controls, matched on age, education, and sex were included. The task entailed the emotional labelling of faces with different facial expressions (happiness, fear, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger) presented in different intensities. Subjects were asked to make a forced-choice response. Results. These revealed that patients with a <b>generalised</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> were less sensitive for the negative facial expressions of anger and disgust compared to the control group. Conclusions. This deficit could play a role in the development and/or the maintaining of the social anxiety. Both explanations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} threat interpretation biases in children 7 - 12 {{years of age}} with separation, social and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (N= 15), non-anxious offspring at risk due to parental anxiety (N= 16) and non-anxious controls of non-anxious parents (N= 14). Children provided interpretations of ambiguous situations to assess cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses. In comparison with non-anxious control children and at-risk children who {{did not differ from}} each other, anxious children reported stronger negative emotion and less ability to influence ambiguous situations. These results suggest that threat interpretation bias may be a cognitive factor associated with ongoing childhood anxiety but not a vulnerability factor associated with parental anxiety.

40|$|Examination of {{mood and}} {{behaviour}} changes after frontal damage {{may contribute to}} understanding the functional role of distinct prefrontal areas in depression and anxiety. Depression and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> symptoms, and behaviour were compared in eight patients with single lateral and eight patients with single medial frontal lesions matched for age, sex, race, education, socioeconomic status, side, and aetiology of lesion 2 weeks and 3 months after brain injury. DSM IV major depressive and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> were more frequent in patients with lateral compared with medial lesions at 2 weeks but not at 3 months. At 3 months, however, patients with lateral damage showed greater severity of depressive symptoms, and greater impairment in both {{activities of daily living}} and social functioning. At initial evaluation depressed mood and slowness were more frequent, whereas at 3 months slowness, lack of energy, and social unease were more frequent in the lateral than the medial group. Patients with lateral lesions showed greater reduction of emotion and motivation (apathy) during both examinations. Medial frontal injury may fail to produce emotional dysregulation or may inhibit experience of mood changes, anxiety, or apathy. Lateral prefrontal damage may disrupt mood regulation and drive while leaving intact the ability to experience (negative) emotions. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEdPsych (Educational Psychology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} affecting 4 % to 5 % of South African children. Recent studies revealed that 30 % to 70 % of children continue to experience problems related to ADHD in adulthood. Adults are becoming increasingly more aware of adult ADHD {{as a result of}} public awareness campaigns in the media. Their first line of action is to visit their family physician, but the question arises whether these practitioners are ready to take on the patients with ADHD. The aims of this study were to determine the familiarity, attitudes and practices of general practitioners in South Africa with regard ADHD in both children and adults and whether there are differences in children and adults with regard to depression and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> as comorbid disorders. The study also briefly explored the training models of general practitioners in South Africa. The research questions are addressed by means of a survey approach, using quantitative measures. An email message with a cover letter, explaining the purpose of the research project, provided a link to a Web-based questionnaire. It was broadcast to 6704 general practitioners on the database of the company MEDpages, who managed the broadcast. A questionnaire attached to an e-mail message was sent to all Departments of Family Health at universities in the country to obtain information with regard to the training models of general practitioners. This was followed up with structured telephone interviews if no response was received. The questionnaire was completed by 229 respondents. The data were statistically analysed using Statistica Version 7. 0. The results revealed a significant need among general practitioners to increase their knowledge base with regard to ADHD, more so with regard to adults. Their knowledge and training with regard to depression and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> were significantly more extensive with regard to adults as opposed to children. Training with regard to ADHD in adults was almost non-existent. It was recommended that the limited knowledge base of general practitioners with regard to ADHD should be addressed by adapting the curriculum of undergraduate medical students and providing opportunities for continued medical education that focus on the diagnosis and management of ADHD in both children and adults. General practitioners should acknowledge the educational psychologist as an equal partner within a multi-disciplinary tea...|$|R
40|$|Prevalence of <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> is {{widespread}} in Great Britain. Previous small-scale {{research has shown}} variations in minor tranquiliser prescribing, identifying several potential predictors of prescribing volume. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between general practice minor tranquiliser prescribing rates and practice population and general practice characteristics for all general practices in England. Methods: Multiple regression analysis of minor tranquiliser prescribing volumes during 2004 / 2005 for 8, 291 English general practices with general practice and population variables obtained from the General Medical Services (GMS) statistics, Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), 2001 Census and 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Results: The highest rates of minor tranquiliser prescribing were in areas with the greatest local deprivation while general practices situated in areas with larger proportions of residents of black ethnic origin had lower rates of prescribing. Other predictors of increased prescribing were general practices with older general practitioners and general practices with older registered practice populations. Conclusion: Our findings {{show that there is}} wide variation of minor tranquilisers prescribing across England which has implications regarding access to treatment and inequity of service provision.

Results: The most significant outcome of the study revealed a considerable need among GPs to increase their knowledge base with regard to ADHD (87 % with regard to children and 89 % with regard to adults). As they were of the opinion that {{they should be able to}} diagnose and manage ADHD in both children (90 %) and adults (85 %) a significant need for a screening tool (83 %) was also found. The GPs' knowledge and training with regard to depression and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> were significantly more extensive with regard to adults than to children. Training with regard to ADHD in adults was almost non-existent. With regard to children the most important barriers were uninformed parents (70 %), limited funds (61 %), uninformed teachers (58 %), and with regard to adults these barriers were uninformed patients (64 %), lack of knowledge on ADHD in adults on the part of the GPs (63 %), and consultation time (58 %). Although GPs did seem to have an awareness of the important role of the psychologist in the diagnosis and effective management of patients with ADHD, their referral practices generally involved a limited interdisciplinary approach. Conclusion: It is recommended that the limited knowledge base of GPs with regard to ADHD should be addressed by adapting the curriculum of undergraduate medical students and providing opportunities for continued medical education that focuses on the diagnosis and management of ADHD, in both children and adults.

We undertook a meta-analysis of studies that compared the prevalence of depression and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in Indigenous populations in the Americas with those of non-Indigenous groups with similar socio-demographic features (Registration number: CRD 42015025854). A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, and article bibliographies was performed. We included comparisons of lifetime rates and prevalence of up to 12 months. We found 19 studies (n =  250, 959) from Latin America, Canada and the US. There were no differences between Indigenous and similar non-Indigenous groups in the 12 -month prevalence of depressive, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> and panic <b>disorders.</b> However, Indigenous people were {{at greater risk of}} PTSD. For lifetime prevalence, rates of <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety,</b> panic and all the depressive disorders were significantly lower in Indigenous participants, whilst PTSD (on adjusted analyses) and social phobia were significantly higher. Results were similar for sub-analyses of Latin America, Canada and the US, and sensitivity analyses by study quality or setting (e. g. health, community etc.). Risk factors for psychiatric illness may therefore be a complex interaction of biological, educational, economic and socio-cultural factors that may vary between disorders.

40|$|Introduction: Anxiety {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most common mental {{disorders}} of youth, with serious implications for academic and social outcomes and future psychopathology. Research has increased greatly in the last 25 years but there are still large gaps in our understanding of the descriptive epidemiology of anxiety and the majority of research focuses on the aetiology of adult disorder. The aim of this thesis was to use the best available evidence from studies using a prospective design and diagnostic outcome measures, to understand the onset and trajectory of anxiety through the lifespan and to determine whether childhood anxiety predicts adult <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Method: Principal Investigators from all prospective longitudinal studies of child mental health were approached in order to gain access to diagnostic data relating to <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youth. Two studies released appropriate data which are analysed here to determine prevalence, first onset, and course of anxiety, with adult outcome assessed in the one cohort that released appropriate adult data. These data are then synthesised with the published data in order to provide a coherent summary of the current picture of the descriptive epidemiology of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> in particular social <b>anxiety</b> and <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> or overanxious <b>disorder.</b> Results: New data from a UK birth cohort show the different <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> to have specific patterns of prevalence and onset, suggesting early onset for separation anxiety and specific phobia. Analysis of data from New York suggests moderate homotypic continuity of social <b>anxiety</b> and overanxious <b>disorder</b> in childhood and adolescence. When examined together the available data show the importance of methodological considerations when determining the prevalence of anxiety in childhood and suggest that although substantial proportions of children will suffer from anxiety most will be disorders of short duration with favourable outcomes. There are, however, consistently across studies 20 - 30 % with chronic anxiety who are likely to have poor outcomes. It is clear that a substantial proportion of adult sufferers have early onset but the figures are inconsistent across different studies. Discussion: The results are discussed in light of the wider literature, and implications for methodology and clinical applications are presented. The limitations of the current approach and directions for future research are briefly outlined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Texts by 97 people who had made contact with a primary care mental health service were analysed. Outcome measures were completion of the guided self-help programme, and change in symptoms assessed by a standardised scale (CORE-OM). Regression analyses indicated that some aspects of participants' syntax helped to predict completion of the programme, and that aspects of syntax and word use helped to predict improvement of symptoms. Participants using non-ﬁnite complement clauses with above-average frequency were {{four times more likely}} to complete the programme (95 % conﬁdence interval 1. 4 to 11. 7) than other participants. Among those who completed, the use of causation words and complex syntax (adverbial clauses) predicted improvement, accounting for 50 % of the variation in well-being beneﬁt. These results suggest that the analysis of narrative style can provide useful information for assessing the likelihood of success of individuals participating in a mental health guided self-help programme...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn four {{previous}} studies, we have delineated {{the role}} of positive circuit coupling between the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and the amygdala during aversive processing in healthy people under stress. This translational circuit—the aversive amplification circuit—is thought to drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behaviour in threatening environments. We assess {{the role of}} this circuit in the pathological manifestation of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> MethodsFor this single-site study, 45 unmedicated participants (22 with <b>generalised</b> and/or social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and 23 healthy controls) were recruited via advertisements from the metropolitan area of Washington, DC (USA). People who applied {{to participate in the}} study had to pass an initial telephone screen and comprehensive screening by a clinician at the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). People with a contraindicated medical disorder, past or current psychiatric <b>disorders</b> other than <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and those using psychoactive medications or illicit drugs were excluded. Eligible individuals could participate as either a healthy control or a patient, depending on diagnosis. They were asked to use a button box to complete a simple emotion identification task (fearful vs happy faces; 44 trials of each) during functional MRI at the NIH. Functional imaging analysis consisted of event-related activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction connectivity analysis of regions coupled with the amygdala during task performance. FindingsA diagnosis-by-valence interaction was recorded in whole-brain amygdala connectivity within the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex clusters identified in our previous study, driven by significantly increased circuit coupling during processing of fearful faces versus happy faces in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Importantly, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, which provides evidence of a continuous association between the circuit and subjective symptoms. InterpretationIn this study and our previous work, we track the functional role of one neural circuit from its involvement in adaptive threat biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we uniquely map a mood and anxiety-related circuit across its adaptive and maladaptive stages. Clinically, this study could provide a step towards a more mechanistic continuum-based approach to <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnosis and might ultimately lead to more targeted treatments for patients with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> FundingNational Institute of Mental Health, USA, and Medical Research Counci...|$|R
50|$|Avoidant {{personality}} disorder {{is reported to}} be especially prevalent in people with anxiety disorders, although estimates of comorbidity vary widely due to differences in (among others) diagnostic instruments. Research suggests that approximately 10-50% of people who have panic disorder with agoraphobia have avoidant {{personality disorder}}, as well as about 20-40% of people who have social anxiety disorder.

50|$|In severe cases, the {{withdrawal}} reaction or protracted withdrawal may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as mania, schizophrenia, agitated depression, panic disorder, <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and complex partial seizures and, especially at high doses, seizure disorders.

Pre-existing disorder or other causes typically do not improve, whereas symptoms of protracted withdrawal gradually improve over the ensuing months. For this reason at least six months should have elapsed after benzodiazepines cessation before re-evaluating the symptoms and updating a diagnosis.|$|E

Open-label studies have suggested efficacy of adjunctive agomelatine in bipolar depression. A study in mice found that it protected against pentylenetetrazole- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. A small placebo-controlled trial found some benefit of agomelatine in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2015 review suggested no recommendations of Agomelatine in support of, or against, its use to treat individuals with seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{incidence}} of headache symptoms consistent with migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) in children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Method. Parents of children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (n = 27) and children without <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (n = 36) completed a headache questionnaire based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2 nd edition) criteria. Results Children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> had {{a higher incidence of}} headache symptoms consistent with migraine and TTH compared to children without <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Girls with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and children with separation <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> had a higher incidence of headaches compared to girls without <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and children with other <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> respectively. Children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> and headaches had higher self-reported anxiety symptom severity compared to children with <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> without headaches and children without <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusion Findings highlight an overlap in anxiety and headaches in children and warrant further research on factors that contribute to the etiology and maintenance of these co-occurring problems.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the current}} {{research}} is to {{gain an understanding of}} the individual experience of anxiety and worry with a particular focus on spontaneous images. In order to do this, the phenomena of spontaneous images, worry and anxiety require clarification. Some history of these phenomena is provided by describing the more researched worry and anxiety and adding the more recent recognition of the experience of spontaneous images. The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association/APA, 2000) describes a <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> as a <b>disorder</b> characterized by excessive worry. The new DSM- 5 (APA, 2013) also does not acknowledge spontaneous images and their impact on the worrier. The present research is not intended to verify the presence of spontaneous images per se, rather it attempts to explore the lived experience of <b>generalised</b> <b>anxiety</b> and worry and to add another perspective to this age old human characteristic with a specific look at the experience of spontaneous images. In order to do this and allow for these phenomena to unfold, a phenomenological stance on worry, anxiety and spontaneous images is taken. Method: The experience of worry, anxiety and associated spontaneous images was analysed using a qualitative approach namely, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith et al, 2009). Data was collected via a semi-structured interview with eight students aged between 18 and 25 years. The interviews took place in a student counselling service and were audio recorded with appropriate consent. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the participants given pseudonyms to ensure anonymity. Results and Conclusions: Six master themes emerged from participant’s accounts; self- absorption, awareness of worry and anxiety as all-encompassing, trying to cope with anxiety and worry, the past in the present, consumed by the other, and finally, life with spontaneous images. The findings are then discussed in relation to the relevant literature, and implications for therapeutic practice, methodological limitations and directions for future research are presented...|$|R
