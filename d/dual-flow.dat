This facility enables designers to make decisions based on the economic performance and enhancement of proposed designs. The focus of the work is on machining cells, where an individual machining centre's cost can be in excess of one million pounds, with the tooling being three/four times more expensive than conventional tooling. With these high-cost investments, where there is a small number of expensive machines, it is essential that designers are assured a greater chance of economic success.

40|$|Facilities {{that draw}} water in large {{quantities}} from natural sources are commonly equipped with mechanistically driven barrier screens for removing indrawn debris and captive fish. Owing to the mistransport of debris into {{the works of the}} facility by the cyclic action of conventional screening apparatus, amny plant operators favor the refitting of intake systems with alternative devices called <b>dual-flow</b> screens, whose manner of operation precludes the deposition of debris downstream of the screen location. Fish conserving apparatus, otherwise suited to the flows and mechanics of a conventional screen, is often attached without alteration to the screen panels of a <b>dual-flow</b> machine in the hopes of rescuing entrapped fish. As opposed to contrary beliefs, the full-scale experiments reported here show why the flow patterns and water speeds associated with a (double-entry) <b>dual-flow</b> screen are more adverse to live fish recovery than flows through a conventional screen. Owing to flow separations at the entries of these devices and the resulting concentration of flow over a restricted portion of the screening, fluid speeds comperable to flows of 30 and 45 cm/s through conventional screens increased to 90 and 140 cm/s at free-flow regions of the screenfront.

Further, the theory predicts that, like the single-stream jet case, flight effects induce noise amplification in the forward quadrant and attenuation in the aft quadrant and have virtually no effect at theta = 90 deg to the jet axis, where theta is the angle between the directions of convection and emission at the retarded time. Amplification in the forward quadrant diminishes as the inner flow velocity increases and becomes optimum when the outer-to-inner velocity ratio is about 0. 5.

Five dietary treatments were tested: 1) gamagrass hay (GH) + no corn (GHNC), 2) gama grass silage (GS) + no corn (GSNC), 3) GS + low corn (GSLC), 4) GS + medium corn (GSMC); and 5) GS + high corn (GSHC). The experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with five treatments and three replications. Total VFA concentrations were not affected by diets. Corn addition linearly decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) molar proportion of acetate. In contrast, molar proportion of propionate was reduced in GSLC (cubic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) but remained similar across other diets. Corn supplementation linearly increased molar proportion of butyrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The acetate + butyrate-to-propionate ratio was highest in cultures offered GSLC (cubic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) but similar across other diets. Feeding GSNC resulted in a higher ruminal pH compared with GHNC (P 3 ̆c 0. 03). Increasing the level of corn supplementation in GS linearly decreased culture pH (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). All diets resulted in similar methane production, with the exception of GSMC, which lowered methane output (quadratic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 004).

In the present paper, the array post-processing method focused upon is DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) for the quantitative determination of spatial distributions of noise sources. Jet noise is highly complex with stationary and convecting noise sources, convecting flows that are the sources themselves, and shock-related and screech noise for supersonic flow.

40|$|The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig at the NASA Glenn Research Center is {{designed}} to test single flow jet nozzles and to measure the appropriate thrust and noise levels. The rig has been designed for the maximum hot condition of 16 lbm/sec of combustion air at 1960 R (maximum) and to produce a maximum thrust of 2000 lb. It was designed for cold flow of 29. 1 lbm/sec of air at 530 R. In addition, it can test <b>dual-flow</b> nozzles (nozzles with bypass flow in addition to core flow) with independent control of each flow. The High- Flow Jet Exit Rig was successfully fabricated in late 2001 and is being readied for checkout tests. The rig will be installed in Glenn's Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig consists of the following major components: a single component force balance, the natural-gas-fueled J- 79 combustor assembly, the plenum and manifold assembly, an acoustic/instrumentation/seeding (A/I/S) section, a table, and the research nozzles. The rig will be unique in that it {{is designed}} to operate uncooled. The structure survives the 1960 R test condition because it uses carefully selected high temperature alloy materials such as Hastelloy-X. The lower plenum assembly was designed to operate at pressures to 450 psig at 1960 R, in accordance with the ASME B 31. 3 piping code. The natural gas-fueled combustor fires directly into the lower manifold. The hot air is directed through eight 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply pipes that supply the upper plenum. The flow is conditioned in the upper plenum prior to flowing to the research nozzle. The 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply lines are arranged in a U-shaped design to provide for a flexible piping system. The combustor assembly checkout was successfully conducted in Glenn's Engine Component Research Laboratory in the spring of 2001. The combustor is a low-smoke version of the J 79 combustor used to power the F 4 Phantom military aircraft. The natural gas-fueled combustor demonstrated high-efficiency combustion over a wide range of operating conditions. This wide operating envelope is required to support the testing of both single- and <b>dual-flow</b> nozzles. Key research goals include providing simultaneous, highly accurate acoustic, flow, and thrust measurements on jet nozzle models in realistic flight conditions, as well as providing scaleable acoustic results. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig is a second-generation high-flow test rig. Improvements include cleaner flow with reduced levels of particulate, soot, and odor. Choked-flow metering is required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy. Thrust measurements from 0 to 2000 lbf are required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy.

During 10 -day incubations, fermenters were fed treatment diets three times daily (140 g/day, divided equally between three feedings) as TMR diet. Effluents from the last 3 days of incubation were collected and composited for analysis. The concentration of trans C 18 : 1 (17. 20, 26. 60, and 36. 08 mg/g DM overflow for HF, MF, and LF treatments, respectively) increased while CLA (2. 53, 2. 35, and 0. 81 mg/g DM overflow) decreased in a linear manner (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) as dietary forage level decreased. As dietary forage levels decreased, the concentrations of t 10 C 18 : 1 (0. 0, 10. 5, 33. 5 mg/g DM) in effluent increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and t 10 c 12 CLA (0. 08, 0. 12, 0. 35 mg/g DM) tended to increases (P 3 ̆c 0. 09) linearly. The concentrations of VA (14. 7, 13. 9, 0. 0 mg/g DM) and c 9 t 11 CLA (1. 78, 1. 52, 0. 03 mg/g DM) in effluent decreased in a linear manner (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) as dietary forage levels decreased. Decreasing dietary forage levels resulted in t 10 C 18 : 1 and t 10 c 12 CLA replacing VA and c 9 t 11 CLA, respectively, in fermenters fed FO and SFO...|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF David Williams for the Master of Ruminant Nutrition {{degree in}} Animal Science, {{presented}} on December 12, 2016 at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: IN VITRO APPARENT RUMINAL DIGESTIBILITY OF DIETS CONTAINING CORN DISTILLERS GRAIN WITH VARYING LEVELS OF CRUDE FAT MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Rebecca Atkinson  Four <b>dual-flow</b> continuous fermenters {{were used in}} a Latin square design to determine the apparent ruminal digestibility and ruminal characteristics of diets containing dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) at various levels of fat content. Fermenters {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the following treatments: 1) 40 % DDGS containing 4. 82 % fat content (40 LOW); 2) 40 % DDGS plus corn oil to obtain 7. 5 % fat (40 MED); 3) 40 % DDGS plus corn oil to obtain 10. 5 % fat (40 HIGH); or 4) 70 % DDGS plus corn oil to obtain 7. 5 % fat (70 MED). Rumen fluid was collected at the beginning of each period from two ruminally cannulated Angus cows previously adapted to the 40 LOW treatment. Each period consisted of 10 days with a seven day adaptation period followed by three days of sample collection. Calories per gram of diet increased as percent fat increased and calories per gram was greater at the 70 % inclusion of DDGS compared to 40 % inclusion of DDGS at all levels of fat content. However, level of fat in the diet did not influence (P ≥ 0. 35) apparent ruminal digestibility of DM, NDF, ADF, CP or total calories. Similarly, inclusion rate of DDGS had no influence (P ≥ 0. 35) on nutrient digestibility. Ammonia concentrations were greatest (P = 0. 0002) for 70 MED compared to the other treatments. However, treatment had no impact (P ≥ 0. 16) on volatile fatty acid production with the exception of propionate which increased (P = 0. 05) as the level of DDGS increased from 40 to 70 % inclusion rate. This data would suggest that level of fat content of DDGS has no negative influence on apparent ruminal digestibility and select ruminal characteristics. From an economic perspective, higher fat DDGS should have a higher price differential, but lower fat DDGS can still be an effective protein and energy substitute...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess {{characteristics}} of in vitro ruminal fermentation when mixed cultures were offered lactation dairy diets supplemented with the direct-fed microorganism, Propionibacterium P 63 in continuous cultures. The design of the experiment was a 2 × 2 factorial with 4 replications. Diets based on corn silage and alfalfa hay as the forage sources were formulated; high forage (HF) or low forage (LF) diet with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 60 : 40 or 40 : 60 (DM basis), respectively, was combined without or with P 63 to form 4 treatments: HF without P 63, HF with P 63, LF without P 63, and LF with P 63. Approximately 700 mL of the strained ruminal fluid obtained from 2 lactating dairy cows was inoculated into each of 4 fermentors with a continuous <b>dual-flow</b> system. The cultures were allowed 6 d of adaptation to the treatments followed by 3 d of sampling and data collection. Feed totaling 40. 0 g of DM was added to each fermentor daily in equal portions delivered at 0800 and 2000 h. The P 63 treatments received 7 × 108 cfu of P 63 /fermentor/feeding. Supplementing P 63 decreased culture pH (P = 0. 05) in the LF diet, but not in the HF diet. Feeding the LF diet increased total VFA concentration compared with the HF diet (P = 0. 01), and supplementing P 63 increased total VFA concentration regardless of level of forage in the diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Molar concentrations and proportions of acetate and propionate did not differ in response to supplementing P 63 in the HF and the LF diet. However, molar concentration and proportion of butyrate increased due to P 63 supplementation (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) only in the LF diet, resulting in interactions between level of forage and P 63 supplementation (P 3 ̆c 0. 08). Overall results in this in vitro study indicate that P 63 supplementation enhanced ruminal fermentation by increasing VFA production, but its impacts on continuous culture fermentation differed between the HF and the LF diet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A major {{stumbling}} block for researchers developing experimental models of mechanotransduction is {{the control of}} experimental variables, in particular the transmission of the mechanical forces at the cellular level. A previous evaluation of {{state of the art}} commercial perfusion chambers showed that flow regimes, applied to impart a defined mechanical stimulus to cells, are poorly controlled and that data from studies in which different chambers are utilized can not be compared, even if the target stress regimes are comparable. Methods This study provides a novel chamber design to provide both physiologically-based flow regimes, improvements in control of experimental variables, as well as ease of use compared to commercial chambers. This novel design achieves controlled stresses through five gasket designs and both single- and <b>dual-flow</b> regimes. Results The imparted shear stress within the gasket geometry is well controlled. Fifty percent of the entire area of the 10 × 21 mm universal gasket (Gasket I, designed to impart constant magnitude shear stresses {{in the center of the}} chamber where outcome measures are taken), is exposed to target stresses. In the 8 mm diameter circular area at the center of the chamber (where outcome measures are made), over 92 % of the area is exposed to the target stress (± 2. 5 %). In addition, other gasket geometries provide specific gradients of stress that vary with distance from the chamber inlet. Bench-top testing of the novel chamber prototype shows improvements, in the ease of use as well as in performance, compared to the other commercial chambers. The design of the chamber eliminates flow deviations due to leakage and bubbles and allows actual flow profiles to better conform with those predicted in computational models. Conclusion The novel flow chamber design provides predictable and well defined mechanical forces at the surface of a cell monolayer, showing improvement over previously tested commercial chambers. The predictability of the imparted stress improves both experiment repeatability as well as the accuracy of inter-study comparisons. Carefully controlling the stresses on cells is critical in effectively mimicking in vivo situations. Overall, the improved perfusion flow chamber provides the needed resolution, standardization and in vitro model analogous to in vivo conditions to make the step towards greater use in research and the opportunity to enter the diagnostic and therapeutic market. </p...|$|E

The {{ban on the}} use of {{antibiotics}} as growth promoters in animal feeds in the European Union has stimulated research on potential alternatives. Recently, propyl-propane thiosulfonate (PTSO), a stable organosulfurate compound of garlic, was purified. The objectives of the current study were to investigate the potential effects of PTSO on rumen microbial fermentation and to define effective doses. Two experiments were conducted using <b>dual-flow</b> continuous culture fermenters in 2 replicated periods. Each experimental period consisted of 5 d for adaptation of the ruminal fluid and 3 d for sampling. Temperature (39 ?C), pH (6. 4), and liquid (0. 10 h(- 1)) and solid (0. 05 h(- 1)) dilution rates were maintained constant. Samples were taken 2 h after feeding and from the 24 -h effluent. Samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFA) and nitrogen fractions, and degradation of nutrients was calculated. In addition, 24 -h effluents from experiment 2 were analyzed for their fatty acid (FA) profile. Treatments in experiment 1 included a negative control without additive, a positive control with monensin (12 mg/L), and PTSO at 30 and 300 mg/L. The addition of 30 mg/L did not affect any of the measurements tested. The addition of 300 mg/L reduced microbial fermentation, as suggested by the decreased total VFA concentration, true degradation of organic matter and acid detergent fiber, and a tendency to decrease neutral detergent fiber degradation. Experiment 2 was conducted to test increasing doses of PTSO (0, 50, 100, and 150 mg/L) on rumen microbial fermentation. At 2 h postfeeding, total VFA and molar proportion of propionate responded quadratically, with higher values in the intermediate doses. Molar proportions of butyrate increased and branched-chain VFA decreased linearly as the dose of PTSO increased. In the 24 -h effluents, total VFA, acetate, and branched-chain VFA concentrations decreased linearly and those of propionate responded cubically with the highest value at 100 mg/L. Saturated FA decreased and unsaturated FA increased linearly with increasing dose of PTSO. The concentration of trans- 10,cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid decreased by 78. 5 % with addition of PTSO at the highest dose (150 mg/L). Results suggest the potential of PTSO to modify ruminal fermentation in a direction consistent with higher propionate molar proportion, higher outflow of unsaturated FA, and low trans- 10,cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid in an effective dose between 50 and 100 mg/L.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} determine the effects of camelina seed (CS) supplementation at different dietary fat levels on ruminal bacterial community composition and how it relates to changes in ruminal fermentation in a <b>dual-flow</b> continuous culture system. Diets were randomly assigned to 8 fermenters (1, 200 – 1, 250 mL) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with four 10 -day experimental periods that consisted of 7 days for diet adaptation and 3 days for sample collection. Treatments were: (1) no CS at 5 % ether extract (EE, NCS 5); (2) no CS at 8 % EE (NCS 8); (3) 7. 7 % CS at 5 % EE (CS 5); and (4) 17. 7 % CS at 8 % EE (CS 8). Megalac was used as a control to adjust EE levels. Diets contained 55 % orchardgrass hay and 45 % concentrate, and fermenters were equally fed a total of 72 g/day (DM basis) twice daily. The bacterial community was determined by sequencing the V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing data were analyzed using mothur and statistical analyses were performed in R and SAS. The most abundant phyla across treatments were the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, accounting for 49 and 39 % of the total sequences, respectively. The bacterial community composition in both liquid and solid fractions of the effluent digesta changed with CS supplementation but not by dietary EE. Including CS in the diets decreased the relative abundances of Ruminococcus spp., Fibrobacter spp., and Butyrivibrio spp. The most abundant genus across treatments, Prevotella, was reduced by high dietary EE levels, while Megasphaera and Succinivibrio were increased by CS supplementation in the liquid fraction. Correlatively, the concentration of acetate was decreased while propionate increased; C 18 : 0 was decreased and polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 18 : 3 n- 3, were increased by CS supplementation. Based on the correlation analysis between genera and fermentation end products, this study revealed that CS supplementation could be energetically beneficial to dairy cows by increasing propionate-producing bacteria and suppressing ruminal bacteria associated with biohydrogenation. However, attention should be given to avoid the effects of CS supplementation on suppressing cellulolytic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Milk fat {{depression}} in cows fed high-grain diets has {{been related to}} an increase in the concentration of trans- 10 C- 18 : 1 and trans- 10, cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in milk. These fatty acids (FA) are produced {{as a result of the}} alteration in rumen biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA. Because a reduction in ruminal pH is usually observed when high-concentrate diets are fed, the main cause that determines the alteration in the biohydrogenation pathways is not clear. The effect of pH (6. 4 vs. 5. 6) and dietary forage to concentrate ratios (F:C; 70 : 30 F:C vs. 30 : 70 F:C) on rumen microbial fermentation, effluent FA profile, and DNA concentration of bacteria involved in lipolysis and biohydrogenation processes were investigated in a continuous culture trial. The <b>dual-flow</b> continuous culture consisted of 2 periods of 8 d (5 d for adaptation and 3 d for sampling), with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Samples from solid and liquid mixed effluents were taken for determination of total N, ammonia-N, and volatile fatty acid concentrations, and the remainder of the sample was lyophilized. Dry samples were analyzed for dry matter, ash, neutral and acid detergent fiber, FA, and purine contents. The pH 5. 6 reduced organic matter and fiber digestibility, ammonia-N concentration and flow, and crude protein degradation, and increased nonammonia and dietary N flows. The pH 5. 6 decreased the flow of C- 18 : 0, trans- 11 C- 18 : 1 and cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA, and increased the flow of trans- 10 C- 18 : 1, C 18 : 2 n- 6, C 18 : 3 n- 3, trans- 11, cis- 15 C- 18 : 2 and trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA in the 1 h after feeding effluent. The pH 5. 6 reduced Anaerovibrio lipolytica (32. 7 vs. 72. 1 pg/ 10 ng of total DNA) and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens vaccenic acid subgroup (588 vs. 1, 394 pg/ 10 ng of total DNA) DNA concentrations. The high-concentrate diet increased organic matter and fiber digestibility, nonammonia and bacterial N flows, and reduced ammonia-N concentration and flow. The high-concentrate diet reduced trans- 11 C- 18 : 1 and trans- 10 C- 18 : 1, and increased C 18 : 2 n- 6, C 18 : 3 n- 3 and trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA proportions in the 1 h after feeding effluent. The increase observed in trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA proportion in the 1 h after feeding effluent due to the high-concentrate diet was smaller that that observed at pH 5. 6. Results indicate that the pH is the main cause of the accumulation of trans- 10 C- 18 : 1 and trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA in the effluent, but the trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA proportion can be also affected by high levels of concentrate in the diet...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of partially replacing dry ground corn with glycerin on ruminal fermentation using a <b>dual-flow</b> continuous culture system. Six fermenters (1, 223 ± 21 ml) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square arrangement with three periods of 10 d each, with 7 d for diet adaptation and 3 d for sample collections. All diets contained 75 % concentrate and three dietary glycerin levels (0, 15, and 30 % on dry matter basis), totaling six replicates per treatment. Fermenters were fed 72 g of dry matter/d equally divided in two meals/d, at 0800 and 2000 h. Solid and liquid dilution rates were adjusted daily to 5. 5 and 11 %/h, respectively. On d 8, 9, and 10, samples of 500 ml of solid and liquid digesta effluent were mixed, homogenized, and stored at - 20 °C. Subsamples of 10 ml were collected and preserved with 0. 2 mL of a 50 % H 2 SO 4 solution for later determination of NH 3 -N and volatile fatty acids. Microbial biomass was isolated from fermenters for chemical analysis at the end of each experimental period. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with α = 0. 05. Glycerin levels did not affect apparent digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0. 13; PQuad. = 0. 40), OM (PLin. = 0. 72; PQuad. = 0. 15), NDF (PLin. = 0. 38; PQuad. = 0. 50) and ADF (PLin. = 0. 91; PQuad. = 0. 18). Also, glycerin inclusion did not affect true digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0. 35; PQuad. = 0. 48), and OM (PLin. = 0. 08; PQuad. = 0. 19). Concentrations of propionate (P < 0. 01) and total volatile fatty acids (P < 0. 01) increased linearly and concentrations of acetate (P < 0. 01), butyrate (P = 0. 01), iso-valerate (P < 0. 01), and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids, as well as the acetate: propionate ratio (P < 0. 01) decreased with glycerin inclusion. Linear increases on NH 3 -N concentration in digesta effluent (P < 0. 01) and on NH 3 -N flow (P < 0. 01) were observed due to glycerin inclusion in the diets. Crude protein digestibility (P = 0. 04) and microbial N flow (P = 0. 04) were greater in the control treatment compared with the other treatments and responded quadratically with glycerin inclusion. Furthermore, the inclusion of glycerin linearly decreased (P = 0. 02) non-ammonia N flow. Glycerin levels did not affect the flows of total N (PLin. = 0. 79; PQuad. = 0. 35), and dietary N (PLin. = 0. 99; PQuad. = 0. 07), as well as microbial efficiency (PLin. = 0. 09; PQuad. = 0. 07). These results suggest that partially replacing dry ground corn with glycerin may change ruminal fermentation, by increasing total volatile fatty acids, and propionate concentration without affecting microbial efficiency, which may improve glucogenic potential of beef cattle diets...|$|E
