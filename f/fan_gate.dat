40|$|In this work, all-polypropylene {{composites}} (all-PP composites) were {{manufactured by}} injection moulding. Prior to injection moulding, pre-impregnated pellets were prepared by a three-step process (filament winding, compression moulding and pelletizing). A highly oriented polypropylene multifilament {{was used as}} the reinforcement material, and a random polypropylene copolymer (with ethylene) {{was used as the}} matrix material. Plaque specimens were injection moulded from the pellets with either a film gate or a <b>fan</b> <b>gate.</b> The compression moulded sheets and injection moulding plaques were characterised by shrinkage tests, static tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis and falling weight impact tests; the fibre distribution and fibre/matrix adhesion were analysed with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that with increasing fibre content, both the yield stress and the perforation energy significantly increased. Of the two types of gates used, the <b>fan</b> <b>gate</b> caused the mechanical properties of the plaque specimens to become more homogeneous (i. e., the differences in behaviour parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction became negligible) ...|$|E

40|$|Orthogonal fluidic {{connections}} {{are essential for}} developing multilayered microfluidic devices. At present, most orthogonal connectors are realized by a horizontal channel and a vertical channel in different plates. Therefore, some extra alignment and adhesion processes for precise plate assembly are required. In this paper, the method of injection molding is proposed to make a one-body-type orthogonal connector in a single plastic plate. The connector was composed of a cantilevered tube {{and the other in}} the substrate. An injection mold was developed in which a side core-pulling mechanism and an ejection mechanism of push-pipes were combined to form the mold for an orthogonal connector. Both the type and the location of gate were optimized for the mold. The results showed that the <b>fan</b> <b>gate</b> in the middle position of the plate was the most suitable in term of both defect control and practicability. The effect of melt temperature was numerically investigated and then verified experimentally. With the optimized parameters, the relative length and the relative wall thickness of a cantilevered tube in the plastic part can reach 98. 89 % and 99. 80 %, respectively. Furthermore, using the plastic part as a cover plate, a three-layer plastic microfluidic device was conveniently fabricated for electrochemical detection...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} with {{the installation of}} a new production size UBE 350 Ton VSC Squeeze Casting system in the Metal Casting Laboratory at Case Western University. A Lindberg 75 k W electrical melting furnace was installed alongside. The challenge of installation and operation of such industrial-size equipment in an academic environment was met successfully. Subsequently, a Sterling oil die heater and a Visi-Track shot monitoring system were added. A significant number of inserts were designed and fabricated over the span of the project, primarily for squeeze casting different configurations of test bars and plates. A spiral ''ribbon insert'' for evaluation of molten metal fluidity was also fabricated. These inserts were used to generate {{a broad range of}} processing conditions and determine their effect {{on the quality of the}} squeeze cast parts. This investigation has studied the influence of the various casting variables on the quality of indirect squeeze castings primarily of aluminum alloys. The variables studied include gating design, fill time and fill patter, metal pressure and die temperature variations. The quality of the die casting was assessed by an analysis of both their surface condition and internal soundness. The primary metal tested was an aluminum 356 alloy. In addition to determining the effect of these casting variables on casting quality as measured by a flat plate die of various thickness, a number of test bar inserts with different gating designs have been inserted in the squeeze casting machine. The mechanical properties of these test bars produced under different squeeze casting conditions were measured and reported. The investigation of the resulting properties also included an analysis of the microstructure of the squeeze castings and the effect of the various structural constituents on the resulting properties. The main conclusions from this investigation are as follows: The ingate size and shape are very important since it must remain open until the casting is solidified and pressure is maintained on the solidifying casting. <b>Fanned</b> <b>gates,</b> particularly on the smaller section castings avoid jetting effects at the ingate end. The fan type ingate helps accomplish a rapid fill without high velocities. The molten metal has to fill the cavity before localized solidification occurs. This is best accomplished with a larger ingate to attain rapid filling without excessive velocity or jetting that occurs at high metal velocities. Straight gates are prone to case jetting of the metal stream even a low velocities. <b>Fanned</b> <b>gates</b> allow use of higher fill velocity without excessive jetting. A higher metal pressure provides a more complete fill of the die including improved compensation for solidification shrinkage. With the proper filling pattern, ingates, overflows and die temperature for a given die, very good tensile properties can be attained in squeeze casting. In general, the smaller squeeze castings require higher die temperatures. Computer models using the UES Procast and MagmaSoft finite element software can, after suitable adjustments, predict the flow pattern in the die cavity...|$|R

40|$|In {{foundries}} a lot {{of effort}} is done to minimize energy consumption in the production to reduce costs and hence increase the competitiveness. At the same time the foundries must live up to the increased demands for high quality castings. Traditional gating systems are known for a straight tapered down runner, a well base and 90 ?bends in the runner system. Previous work has shown that the traditional way of designing gating systems creates high inconsistency in fl ow patterns during fi lling. In the streamlined gating systems there are no sharp changes in direction and a large effort is done to confi ne and control the fl ow of the molten metal during mould fi lling. The main objective in the work presented here is to use the principles of the streamlined gating systems to reduce the weight of the gating system relative to the traditional layouts. By reducing the weight of gating system and thereby improving yield, the amount of molten iron needed is also reduced, hence reducing the energy consumption for melting. Experiments in real production lines have proven {{that it is possible to}} achieve a reduction in the poured weight by using the streamlined gating systems. In a layout for casting of three valve housings in a vertically parted mould the weight of the gating system was reduced by 1. 1 kg changing from the traditional layouts to the streamlined gating systems. This weight reduction corresponds in this case to a 20 % weight reduction for the gating system. Using streamlined <b>gating</b> systems with <b>fan</b> <b>gates</b> to give a benefi cial heat distribution in the castings may be an effi cient tool to eliminate the need for heat treatment. In the experiments the change in gating system from the traditional layout to the streamlined layout removed the need for heat treatment. This obviously means a huge energy saving in the foundry. The energy consumption for heat treatment of iron has been found to be 0. 489 kWh/kg. The valve housing in the experiments weighs 3 kg so when the need for heat treatment is removed, around 1. 5 kWh is saved per casting. Along with the reduction in energy used the foundry also save the cost of handling the castings for the heat treatment and the production times is reduced considerably. When the moulds for the vertical layout is produced on a DISAMATIC that produces 350 moulds an hour the total energy saved per hour for both melting and heat treatment becomes 2, 000 kWh and per eight hour work day 16, 000 kWh. Seen in this perspective the potential for saving energy in the foundries is substantial. Furthermore the experiments where ductile iron valve housings was cast also proved that it is possible to lower the pouring temperature from 1, 400 篊 to 1, 300 篊 without the risk of cold runs. This is possible due to a high flow rate during mould fi lling in combination with low velocities due to the use of <b>fan</b> <b>gates.</b> All of this has also been investigated in experiments using glass plate fronted moulds...|$|R
