5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent <b>earnings</b> <b>for</b> these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
30|$|Following the {{standard}} practice, the decomposition {{is based on}} three alternative assumptions: first, that the <b>earnings</b> function <b>for</b> men also applies to women; second, that the <b>earnings</b> function <b>for</b> women also applies to men; and third, that a weighted average of the separately estimated wage structures {{for men and women}} represents the non-discriminatory wage structure. The decomposition predicated on the <b>earnings</b> function <b>for</b> men and women provide the upper and lower bounds of the estimates. A non-discriminatory wage structure should lie somewhere in between. In this paper, following Cotton (1988), we have used the proportion {{of men and women in}} wage employment as weights for calculating the non-discriminatory wage structure.|$|R

5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year.
