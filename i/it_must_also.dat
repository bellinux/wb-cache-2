5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Since each prime p divides L by assumption, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> divide {{one of the}} q factors; {{since each}} q is prime as well, it must be that p=q. Iteratively {{dividing}} by the p factors shows that each p has an equal counterpart q; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{independent}} variable x itself is permitted to depend on other variables, then the expression becomes more complicated, as <b>it</b> <b>must</b> include <b>also</b> higher order differentials in x itself. [...] Thus, for instance, ...|$|R

5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> divide the left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, then it must divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself {{shows up at the}} window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E

5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> {{be noted}} that the {{narrative}} follows the epic format, with the clashing of antagonistic entities, conquests and retreats, a concern for genealogy, and the central moral question, often rough and binary but also thrilling, of good vs. evil.|$|E
25|$|Water content (θ) {{is also a}} {{directly}} measurable property; it is {{the fraction}} of the total rock which is filled with liquid water. This is also a fraction between 0 and 1, but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be {{less than or equal to}} the total porosity.|$|E

25|$|A {{disease or}} {{condition}} {{is not a}} pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be infectious.

First, it must provide a mechanism for the integration of signals across different brain regions (both cortical and subcortical). <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> be able to explain the simultaneous processing of unrelated signals that are held separate from one another and integrated signals that must be viewed as a whole.|$|E

25|$|If {{multiple}} solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice {{based on}} their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> meet further requirements.|$|E
