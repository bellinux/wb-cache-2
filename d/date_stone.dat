500|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square <b>date</b> <b>stone</b> engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture.

The experiments {{were carried out}} to explore textile dyes (maxilon blue (GRL), and Methyl Orange (MO)) uptake by DSAC. The surface structure of <b>date</b> <b>stones</b> and <b>date</b> <b>stones</b> activated by HNO 3 were analyzed by FT-IR, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The influence of various experimental factors such as initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature and pH of dye solution were investigated. The increase in initial pH in the ranges of 2 - 10 decrease the yields removal of methyl orange dye (MO) while increases of maxilon blue dye GRL on DSAC.

The Temkin equation {{was found to have}} the correlation coefficient value in very good agreement of MO, while Freundlich equation was found to give a good coerelation of GRL dye.

40|$|Background and Aim: Availability and {{low cost}} of <b>date</b> <b>stones</b> make them useful as raw {{material}} {{in the preparation of}} activated carbon. Cyanide, because of its toxicity for humans and aquatic organisms, {{is one of the most}} important health problems. The aim of the present study was to evaluate cyanide removal from aqueous solutions and determine influencing parameters in its adsorption into activated carbon prepared from <b>date</b> <b>stones.</b> Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, activated carbon was prepared by using an electrical furnace giving out 750 °C temperature for 100 min. The effect of pH (2 - 12), cyanide concentration (100 - 300 mg/L) and activated carbon dosage (0. 25 - 2 g/L) on the absorption process were explored. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and the mean absorption rate was reported. Results: The maximum adsorption capacity of 50. 21 mg/g corresponded with Langmuir model. Kinetic evaluation indicated that the adsorption of cyanide ions by the adsorbent clearly followed the pseudo-second order rate reaction. The absorption was pH dependent and the maximum adsorption was done by solutions having pH 9. At an optimum pH 9, over 97 % removal of 100 mg/L cyanide was attained for an adsorbent dose of 1. 25 g/L during a 40 min contact time. Conclusion: Activated carbon prepared from <b>date</b> <b>stones</b> is an efficient and low-cost adsorbent for removing of different concentrations of cyanide from water and wastewater...|$|R
