5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E

25|$|A breed {{that is not}} {{recognised}} by a {{kennel club}} means {{that it has not}} been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the breed is not a breed. Major kennel clubs usually require a breed to have a specific amount of documentation, as well as a large enough breed club to warrant the training of judges for the breed, for the breed to be accepted.|$|E
25|$|The use of 2, 4 and 6 {{as opposed}} to 9, 11 and 13 {{indicates}} that the chord does not include a 7th unless specifically specified. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> these notes must be played within an octave of the root, nor the extended notes in 7th chords should be played outside of the octave, although it is commonly the case. 6 is particularly common in a minor sixth chord (also known as minor/major sixth chord, as the 6 refers to a major sixth interval).|$|E
25|$|A common {{understanding}} exists {{that in the}} national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the regional data of Japan. Even when the HOV formula fits well, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims {{that the state of}} factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.|$|E

25|$|According to Shia theologians, infallibility is {{considered}} a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility {{is based on the}} Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but {{due to the fact that}} they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.|$|E
25|$|An MOT test {{certificate}} confirms {{that at the}} time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the vehicle is roadworthy for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle but not its safety forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.|$|E
25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Sachs' critique, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their book blog with twelve specific points. First, {{on the role}} of geography, Acemoglu and Robinson agree that geography is crucial in shaping institutions but do not recognize a deterministic role of geography in economic performance. Second, on the positive role authoritarian governments can play in economic growth, {{especially in the case of}} China, the fast economic growth could be part of the catch-up effect. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> authoritarian governments are better than democratic governments in promoting economic growth. It is still way too early, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, to draw a definite conclusion solely based on the example of China. Last, on industrialization, they argue that industrialization is contingent upon institutions.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

He shared {{that he had}} 4 {{surgeries}} in 7 days in the week prior to his appearance, when {{he was suffering from}} liver complications and kidney failure. Scott told the audience, [...] "When you die, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and {{in the manner in which}} you live." [...] At the ESPYs, a video was also shown that included scenes of Scott from a clinic room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and other scenes from Scott's life fighting cancer. Scott ended the speech by calling his daughter up to the stage for a hug, [...] "because I need one," [...] and telling the audience to [...] "have a great rest of your night, have a great rest of your life." ...|$|E

500|$|Stuttgart manager Joachim Löw was {{disappointed}} with the defeat, but remained confident about his future at the team, {{as well as the}} season: [...] "I'm calmly looking forward to the discussion. The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also taking time to defend Löw: [...] "We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally. We could have done better this season. We carelessly squandered about eight games". Yakin agreed and offered his own comments: [...] "You have to talk about many things, you cannot work together in the way it was this year." ...|$|E
