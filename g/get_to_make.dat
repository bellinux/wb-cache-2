At certain points, they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings.

After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} to go back to the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E

At {{its peak in}} 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> The Governor).

Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap Dynasty, with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was {{a starting point for}} many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith.

500|$|The {{inclusion}} {{or cutting}} of some characters sparked speculation from fans {{as to the}} importance of the characters in the final book of the series, which was released just ten days after the film. In April 2006, representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' brother and the barman of the Hog's Head, in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore's Army. A week later WB announced that the role was [...] "very minor", allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role, which, before the final book, was not even a speaking part. MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf, who appeared in the second film, Chamber of Secrets, and in the fifth book, would be cut, opening up [...] "plot questions" [...] as to how the role of the elf would be filled. MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher, the Black family's house-elf, was cut from the film in one draft of the script. However, after Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him, saying, [...] "You know, I wouldn't [...] if I were you.

2500|$|During a fall movie preview, Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Malkovich [...] "easily racks {{up the most}} laughs" [...] among the cast as the foul-mouthed and short-tempered ex-CIA man. The first scene Malkovich {{performed}} was a phone call in which he shouts several obscenities at Pitt and McDormand. But Malkovich could {{not be on the}} sound stage for the call because he was rehearsing a play, so he called in the lines from his apartment in Paris. Regarding the scene, Malkovich said, [...] "It was really late at night and I was screaming {{at the top of my}} lungs. God knows what the neighbors thought." [...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well.

2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E

A sailor can call in no ally as efficient in subduing this mortal foe, as an intelligent and cultivated mind. The man who really thinks much, seldom drinks much; but there are hours--nay, weeks and months of idleness in a ship, in which the temptation to resort to unnatural excitement in quest of pleasure, is too strong for minds, that are not well fortified, to resist.
