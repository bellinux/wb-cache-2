In Visual Studio C++ 6.0, brace matching behavior was set to ignore braces found in comments. In VSC 7.0, its behavior was changed to compute commented braces.IntelliJ IDEA's Ruby on Rails plugin also enables braces matching. It has been proposed that Perl 5 be modified to facilitate braces matching. The Microsoft Excel 2003 <b>formula</b> <b>bar</b> has parentheses matching. Its implementation shows all the pairs of parentheses as different colors, so it is possible to easily analyze them all at once.|$|E

The structures of 1, 3, and 52 ̆ 0137 have been determined by X-ray diffraction analyses. These new boron compounds are bright blue emitters. Electroluminescent devices using compound 2 or 8 as the emitter and the electron-transport layer have been successfully fabricated. Molecular orbital calculations (Gaussian 98) have established that the blue emission of compounds 12 ̆ 0138 originates from charge transfer between the 3 ̆c 0 orbital of the ligand L and the p 3 ̆c 0 orbital of the boron center. The ability of these boron compounds to bind to metal centers to form supramolecular assemblies was demonstrated by treatment of compound 2 with Zn(O 2 CCF 3) 2, which generated a 1 : 1 chelate complex 22 ̆ 2 c 5 Zn(O 2 CCF 3) 2 (10), and also by treatment of compound 4 with AgNO 3, yielding a 2 : 1 coordination compound (4) 22 ̆ 2 c 5 Ag(NO 3) (11).

40|$|The {{consumption}} of Brazilian cassava {{has been reduced}} {{due to a lack}} of adjustment to the modern lifestyle. To reverse this trend, new products could be developed specifically targeted to high-value niche markets. Cereal bars stand out as fast food high in nutritional value. A <b>bar</b> <b>formula</b> mimicking cereal <b>bars</b> was prepared using a mixture of Brazilian cassava flour, hydrogenated vegetable fat, dried bananas, ground cashew nuts, and glucose syrup. After being pressed, the bars were dried for 1 hour at 65 °C, packaged in films, and stored under ambient conditions. Its stability was continuously monitored for 210 days in order to ensure its safety and enable its introduction to the market. Texture loss was observed in the packed bars after 90 days of storage, but the sensory characteristics allowed the testers to perceive this tendency after only 30 days of storage. However, chemical, physical, and microbial analyses confirmed that the bars were safe for consumption for 180 days.
