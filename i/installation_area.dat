Assigned to his protective detail is Shane Schofield {{and his team}} of Marines including Gunnery Sergeant Gena 'Mother' Newman, Staff Sergeant Elizabeth 'Fox' Gant and Buck 'Book II' Riley Jr. They are plunged into a race for survival when an Air Force general, Charles “Caesar” Russell, unleashes a plan he has been working on for over 15 years. Despite being 'executed' {{on the day of the}} president's inauguration, Caesar is revived, and with a squadron of 50 elite Air Force soldiers (the 7th Squadron), have taken control of Area 7 and initiated a lockdown. A transmitter, attached to the president's heart before he was elected, has been activated; a satellite sends and receives messages to and from this transmitter, which is powered by the kinetic energy of the president's heart beating. If the satellite doesn't receive the messages from the transmitter 14 Type-240 Blast Plasma based nuclear warheads in the airports of the majorl cities of the United States will explode, destroying these cities, and making way for a new, racist, Confederate America. As long as the President's heart beats, the messages will be sent to the satellite, and the nuclear warheads will not detonate. To prevent the president from trying to escape Area 7, Caesar also overrode the launch codes on the Nuclear Football so that to prevent the detonation of the warheads, the president must place his hand on the fingerprint sensor on the Football (that is being kept in Caesar's possession) every 90 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Rubble mound breakwaters use {{structural}} voids {{to dissipate}} the wave energy. Rock or concrete armour units {{on the outside}} of the structure absorb most of the energy, while gravels or sands prevent the wave energy's continuing through the breakwater core. The slopes of the revetment are typically between 1:1 and 1:2, depending upon the materials used. In shallow water, revetment breakwaters are usually relatively inexpensive. As water depth increases, the material requirements, and hence costs, increase significantly.New breakwaters, the wave attenuators - wawtech.net - are now available. Wave attenuators consist of concrete elements properly dimensioned ( [...] L = 2,10 m x H = 1,40 m x W = 2 m [...] ) placed horizontally just one feet under the free surface, positioned along a lone parallel to the coast.The wave attenuator has fours sea-side ( [...] seaward [...] ) slabs, one vertical slab and two rear-side ( [...] landward [...] )slabs each separated from the next by a space of 200 mm ( [...] 8" [...] ).An extra front-side ( [...] seaward [...] )shield stops the sand erosion near the <b>installation</b> <b>area</b> and the approaching of elements like plastic bags, all types of seaweeds, small size woods, etc. This row of 4 front side slabs and two rear side slabs, reflects the offshore wave by the action of the volume of water located under it which, made to oscillate under the effect of the incident wave, creates waves in phase opposition to the incident wave downstream from the slabs.The use of this type of wave attenuator solves a number of problems unsolved by rock breakwaters in the past.Such attenuators offer the following main advantages:- transparency to currents- no destruction of the seabed- partially invisible- maintenance of natural environments- coasts more competitive as water depth increases- possibility of modular installation- reversibility.- possibility to install each Wave attenuator elements stream-oriented or wind-oriented in order to stop the effect of the main erosion.- Realization of a sand-trap able to form new sand volumes.- Realization of a garbage-trap able to stop floating elements.|$|E

40|$|On-site {{management}} of construction waste commonly determines its destination. In {{the case of}} plasterboard (PB), on-site segregation becomes crucial for closed-loop recycling. However, PB is commonly mixed with other wastes in Spain. In this context, the involvement of stakeholders that can contribute to reversing this current situation is needed. This paper analyzes on-site waste {{management of}} PB in Spain through a pilot study of a construction site, with the main objective of identifying best practices to increase waste prevention, waste minimization, and the recyclability of the waste. On-site visits and structured interviews were conducted. The results show five management stages: PB distribution (I); PB installation (II); Construction waste storage at the <b>installation</b> <b>area</b> (III); PB waste segregation at the <b>installation</b> <b>area</b> (IV) and PB waste transfer to the PB container and storage (V). The proposed practices refer to each stage and include the merging of Stages III and IV. This measure would avoid the mixing of waste fractions in Stage III, maximizing the recyclability of PB. In addition, two requisites for achieving enhanced management are analyzed: ‘Training and commitment’ and ‘fulfilling the requirements established by the current regulation’. The results show that foremen adopted a more pessimistic attitude than installers towards a joint commitment for waste management. Moreover, not all supervisors valued {{the importance of a}} site waste management plan, regulated by the Royal Decree 105 / 2008 in Spain...|$|E

Rather, rotating type-attractions were found more efficient. Lastly, the study analyzes each attraction’s efficiency and satisfaction to discuss what attractions are appropriate for installation in future theme parks. While roller coaster type attractions have relatively low operational efficiency, they are able to deliver high customer satisfaction and thus carry a brand effect that increases theme park customers’ revisit intention.|$|E

This study optimized the system control parameters for buildings in different climates, i. e., Singapore (hot and humid), Beijing (moderate) and Boulder (hot and dry), with a multi-parameter optimization based on the Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm to obtain optimal system performance in terms of relatively maximum electricity saving rate with a minimum cost payback period. The {{results indicated that the}} selection of operation parameters is significantly influenced by climatic conditions. The solar collector <b>installation</b> <b>area</b> exhibited the greatest effect on both energy and economic performance in humid areas, and the heating water flow rate was also important. For dry areas, a change in desiccant concentration had the largest effect on system performance. Although the effect of the desiccant flow rate was significant in humid cities, it appeared to have little influence over buildings in dry areas. Furthermore, the requirements of the solar collector <b>installation</b> <b>area</b> in humid areas were much higher. The optimized area was up to 70 m 2 in Singapore compared with 27. 5 m 2 in Boulder. Similar results were found for the flow rates of heating water and the desiccant solution. Applying the optimization, humid cities could achieve an electricity saving of more than 40 % with a six-year payback period. The optimal performance for hot and dry areas of a 38 % electricity saving with a payback period of 14 years was also acceptable.
