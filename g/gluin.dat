Several invariants of S {{are then}} related {{to those of}} S 1 and S 2; we review {{some of the most}} {{important}} properties preserved under gluings. The aim of this paper is to prove that this is the case for the Frobenius vector and the Hilbert series. Applications to complete intersection affine semigroups are also given. 1. On <b>gluins</b> of affine semigroups In this section we take a quick tour summarizing some of the more relevant results on the gluing of affine semigroups. We also introduce concepts and notations that will be used later on in the paper. An affine semigroup S is finitely generated submonoid of Zm for some positive integer m. If S∩(−S) = 0, that is to say S is reduced, it can be shown that it has a unique minimal system of generators (see for instance [24, Chapter 3]). The cardinality of the minimal generating system of S is known as the embedding dimension of S. Recall that each reduced affine semigroup can be embedded into Nm for some m. In the following we will assume that our affine semigroups are submonoids of Nm. Given an affine semigroup S ⊆ Nm, denote by G(S) the group spanned by S, that is...|$|R
40|$|Chloride-transporting {{membrane}} proteins of the CLC family {{appear in}} two distinct mechanistic flavors: H(+) -gated Cl(-) channels and Cl(-) /H(+) antiporters. Transmembrane H(+) movement {{is an essential}} feature of both types of CLC. X-ray crystal structures of CLC antiporters show the Cl(-) ion pathway through these proteins, but the H(+) pathway is known only inferentially by two conserved glutamate residues that act as way-stations for H(+) in its path through the protein. The extracellular-facing H(+) transfer glutamate becomes directly exposed to aqueous solution during the transport cycle, but the intracellular glutamate E 203, <b>Glu(in),</b> is buried within the protein. Two regions, denoted "polar" and "interfacial," at the intracellular surface of the bacterial antiporter CLC-ec 1 are examined here as possible pathways by which intracellular aqueous protons gain access to <b>Glu(in).</b> Mutations at multiple residues of the polar region have little effect on antiport rates. In contrast, mutation of E 202, a conserved glutamate at the protein-water boundary of the interfacial region, leads to severe slowing of the Cl(-) /H(+) antiport rate. An X-ray crystal structure of E 202 Y, the most strongly inhibited of these substitutions, shows an aqueous portal leading to <b>Glu(in)</b> physically blocked by cross-subunit interactions; moreover, this mutation has only minimal effect on a monomeric CLC variant, which necessarily lacks such interactions. The several lines of experiments presented argue that E 202 acts as a water-organizer that creates a proton conduit connecting intracellular solvent with <b>Glu(in)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{chloride}} channel (CLC) {{family is}} distinctive in that some members are Cl− ion channels {{and others are}} Cl−/H+ antiporters. The molecular mechanism that couples H+ and Cl− transport in the antiporters remains unknown. Our characterization of a novel bacterial homolog from Citrobacter koseri, CLC-ck 2, has yielded surprising discoveries about the requirements for both Cl− and H+ transport in CLC proteins. First, even though CLC-ck 2 lacks conserved amino acids near the Cl−-binding sites {{that are part of}} the CLC selectivity signature sequence, this protein catalyzes Cl− transport, albeit slowly. Ion selectivity in CLC-ck 2 is similar to that in CLC-ec 1, except that SO 42 − strongly competes with Cl− uptake through CLC-ck 2 but has no effect on CLC-ec 1. Second, and even more surprisingly, CLC-ck 2 is a Cl−/H+ antiporter, even though it contains an isoleucine at the <b>Gluin</b> position that was previously thought to be a critical part of the H+ pathway. CLC-ck 2 is the first known antiporter that contains a nonpolar residue at this position. Introduction of a glutamate at the <b>Gluin</b> site in CLC-ck 2 does not increase H+ flux. Like other CLC antiporters, mutation of the external glutamate gate (Gluex) in CLC-ck 2 prevents H+ flux. Hence, Gluex, but not <b>Gluin,</b> is critical for H+ permeation in CLC proteins...|$|E
40|$|CLC-ec 1, a {{bacterial}} homologue of the CLC family’s transporter subclass, catalyzes transmembrane exchange of Cl− and H+. Mutational analysis {{based on the}} known structure reveals several key residues required for coupling H+ to the stoichiometric countermovement of Cl−. E 148 (Gluex) transfers protons between extracellular water and the protein interior, and E 203 (<b>Gluin)</b> is thought to function analogously on the intracellular face of the protein. Mutation of either residue eliminates H+ transport while preserving Cl− transport. We tested the role of <b>Gluin</b> by examining structural and functional properties of mutants at this position. Certain dissociable side chains (E, D, H, K, R, but not C and Y) retain H+/Cl− exchanger activity to varying degrees, while other mutations (V, I, or C) abolish H+ coupling and severely inhibit Cl− flux. Transporters substituted with other nonprotonatable side chains (Q, S, and A) show highly impaired H+ transport with substantial Cl− transport. Influence on H+ transport of side chain length and acidity was assessed using a single-cysteine mutant to introduce non-natural side chains. Crystal structures of both coupled (E 203 H) and uncoupled (E 203 V) mutants are similar to wild type. The results {{support the idea that}} <b>Gluin</b> is the internal proton-transfer residue that delivers protons from intracellular solution to the protein interior, where they couple to Cl− movements to bring about Cl−/H+ exchange...|$|E

Fully understanding the mechanism of action of total flavonoids from MDQ is helpful for the development of new drugs and the utilization of resources. Male Wistar rat model of blood stasis was established by injecting dexamethasone into the intramuscular side of the thigh. Then they were given related drugs via an intragastric administration for a successive 10  days. After 7  days, the following occurred: firstly, the method of blocking the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) was used for 10  min, followed by a restoration of perfusion. After 72  h, we performed a temporary occlusion of the rat’s middle cerebral artery for 2  h with an intraluminal thread method. This was followed by reperfusion for 24  h, respectively, to establish the rat model of cerebral ischemic tolerance with blood stasis. Viscosity of the whole blood was measured after the last administration was given blood. Brain was removed, and then the activity of ATP enzyme and T-SOD was determined. To observe the pathological changes of the hippocampus area by HE staining, and the expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax were observed by immunohistochemical method. The rat model of cerebral ischemic tolerance with blood stasis was copied successfully. The whole blood viscosity, the activity of NOS, the content of <b>Gluin</b> in the ischemic brain in the IPC model group and the ischemia–reperfusion group were increased significantly. The activity of ATPase was decreased significantly. Compared with the ischemia–reperfusion model group, the activity of ATPase and the whole blood viscosity in the ischemic preconditioning (IPC) group were increased significantly. The activity of NOS and the content of <b>Gluin</b> were decreased significantly. The degree of pathological injury of the brain tissue was also relieved significantly. Total flavonoids of MDQ were used, improving blood circulation, improving energy metabolism, activating endogenous anti-oxidative capability, enhancing the antiapoptotic effect, and relieving the injury of the nerve cell. Hence, the use of MDQ flavonoids improves the tolerance ability of cerebral ischemia...|$|E

A combined analysis of existing LEP data, considering simultaneously conventional SUSY signatures and purely hadronic final states, should achieve a 95 % cl sensitivity to {{the case that the}} SU(2) and U(1) gauginos are massless. 183 GeV running should be able to exclude the case that the wino or wino and gluino are light while the bino is heavy, except possibly for a small region of µ, tanβ. 1 Research supported in part by NSF-PHY- 94 - 23002 An important prediction of SUSY breaking scenarios which give small or negligible masses to the SU(2) gauginos (winos) is that the lighter physical chargino has mass ≤ mW. 2 If the U(1) gaugino (bino) also has negligible mass then the lightest neutralino is a nearly massless photino.

40|$|The lack of methodological {{support for}} reuse has been {{identified}} as one of the major causes why software developers can not take full advantage of reuse pay offs such as software productivity, quality, and cost improvement. There is, therefore, a need for explicit definitions about how to practice reuse as part of the development process. These definitions include models and properties of reuse techniques which can improve the understanding and provide more guidance for the software developers that want to effectively adopt reuse. In this paper we provide a model and properties related to a reuse technique called separation of concerns that can be applied in object-oriented design. The formal model defines how combine classes or components dealing with different concerns in object-oriented design so that separation of concerns is achieved.

40|$|We develop {{techniques}} for defining {{and working with}} fundamental cycles on mod-uli spaces of J-holomorphic curves which are not necessarily cut out transversally. Such techniques {{have the potential for}} applications as foundations for invariants in symplectic topology arising from “counting ” J-holomorphic curves. We illustrate the methods we introduce by applying them to Gromov–Witten theory and Hamiltonian Floer homology for general symplectic manifolds. We introduce the notion of an implicit atlas on a moduli space (similar to a Kuran-ishi atlas in the sense of McDuff–Wehrheim [MW 13 a]), which is (roughly) a convenient system of local finite-dimensional reductions. We present a general intrinsic strategy for constructing an implicit atlas on a moduli space of J-holomorphic curves which, in particular, is canonical (i. e. does not depend on any extra choices). The main technical step in applying this strategy in any particular setting is to prove appropriate gluing theorems. We carry out this strategy in the specific examples of Gromov–Witten the-ory and Hamiltonian Floer homology (though we only give a detailed proof of <b>gluin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dent’s {{disease is}} {{associated}} with impaired renal endocytosis and endosomal acidification. It is linked to mutations in the membrane chloride/proton exchanger ClC- 5, however, a direct link between localization in the protein and functional phenotype of the mutants has not been established until now. Here, two Dent’s disease mutations, G 212 A and E 267 A, were investigated using heterologous expression in HEK 293 T cells, patch-clamp measurements and confocal imaging. WT and, mutant ClC- 5 exhibited mixed cell membrane and vesicular distribution. Reduced ion currents were measured for both mutants and both exhibited reduced capability to support endosomal acidification. Functionally, mutation G 212 A was capable of mediating anion/proton antiport but dramatically shifted the activation of ClC- 5 towards more depolarized potentials. The shift {{can be explained by}} impeded movements of the neighboring gating glutamate Gluext, a residue that confers major part of the voltage dependence of ClC- 5 and serves as a gate at the extracellular entrance of the anion transport pathway. Cell surface abundance of E 267 A was reduced by ~ 50 % but also dramatically increased gating currents were detected for this mutant and accordingly reduced probability to undergoing cycles associated with electrogenic ion transport. Structurally, the gating alternations correlate to the proximity of E 267 A to the proton glutamate <b>Gluin</b> that serves as intracellular gate in the proton transport pathway and regulates the open probability of ClC- 5. Remarkably, two other mammalian isoforms, ClC- 3 and ClC- 4, also differ from ClC- 5 in gating characteristics affected by the here investigated disease-causing mutations. This evolutionary specialization, together with the functional defects arising from mutations G 212 A and E 267 A, demonstrate that the complex gating behavior exhibited by most of the mammalian CLC transporters is an important determinant of their cellular function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} Jacobi-Bernoulli cohomology associated to a semi-simplicial Lie algebra (SELA). For an algebraic scheme X over C, we construct a tangent SELA TX and show that the Jacobi-Bernoulli cohomology of TX is related to infinitesimal deformations of X. 0. Overview The ’usual ’ deformation theory, e. g. of complex structures, {{in the manner of}} Kodaira-Spencer-Grothendieck (cf. e. g. [3, 9] and references therein), is commonly couched in terms of a differential graded Lie algebra or dgla g. It can be viewed, as in [7], as studying the deformation ring R(g), defined in term of the Jacobi cohomology, i. e. the cohomology of the Jacobi complex associated to g. This setting is somewhat restrictive, e. g. it is not broad enough to accomodate such naturally occurring deformation problems as embedded deformations of a submanifold X in a fixed ambient space Y. In [6] we introduced the notion of Lie atom (essentially, Lie pair) and an associated Jacobi-Bernoulli complex as an extension of that of dgla and its Jacobi complex, one that is broad enough to handle embedded deformations {{and a number of other}} problems besides. A purpose of this paper is to establish the familiar notion of (dg) semisimplicial Lie algebra (SELA) as an appropriately general and convenient setting for deformation theory. As a first approximation, one can think of SELA as a structure like that of the Čech complex of a sheaf of Lie algebras on a topological space X with respect to some open covering of X. Not only is SELA a broad generalization of Lie atom, it is broad enough, as we show, to encompass deformations of (arbitrarily singular) algebraic schemes (over C). To express the deformation theory of a SELA g • we {{introduce a}} complex that we call the Jacobi-Bernoulli complex of g•, though a more proper attribution would be to Jacobi-Bernoulli-Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff. In a nutshell, the point of this complex is that it transforms a gluing condition from nonabelian coycle condition to ordinary (additive) cocycle condition via the multilinearity of the groups making up the complex.
