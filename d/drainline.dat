Since mercury is ranked among dangerous chemicals, its quantity is limited and checked not only in environment. The aim of this thesis was to determine concentration of mercury in water from labs and in influent and effluent water from neutralization station of Brno university of Technology, Faculty of Chemistry. Water from neutralization is also mixed with sewage. Advanced mercury spectrometer AMA 254 was used or analysis. Results confirmed, that water flows out from lab to neutralization with relatively high concentration of mercury, highly exceeding limits of <b>drainline.</b> Water from neutralizing station also doesn´t show so high concentration of mercury, because it is mixed with waters from other labs and pH of water is amended. Special waste bottles for liquid waste with risk elements and dangerous compounds are available; from results can be decided, that not everybody follows the rules and some people might pour the waste right in to the sink. Resolution could have been safer acquisitions in labs. Students, who manipulate with dangerous chemicals should be alive to risk, which threatens with pouring into the sink, contamination and dangerous for all components of environment...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary In {{every home}} {{irrespective}} of its size, location, age, or efficiency, {{heat in the}} form of drainwater or dryer exhaust is wasted. Although from a waste stream, this energy has the potential for being captured, possibly stored, and then reused for preheating hot water or air thereby saving operating costs to the homeowner. In applications such as a shower and possibly a dryer, waste heat is produced {{at the same time as}} energy is used, so that a heat exchanger to capture the waste energy and return it to the supply is all that is needed. In other applications such as capturing the energy in drainwater from a tub, dishwasher, or washing machine, the availability of waste heat might not coincide with an immediate use for energy, and consequently a heat exchanger system with heat storage capacity (i. e. a regenerator) would be necessary. This study describes a two-house experimental evaluation of a system designed to capture waste heat from the shower, dishwasher clothes washer and dryer, and to use this waste heat to offset some of the hot water energy needs of the house. Although each house was unoccupied, they were fitted with equipment that would completely simulate the heat loads and behavior of human occupants including operating the appliances and fixtures on a demand schedule identical to Building American protocol (Hendron, 2009). The heat recovery system combined (1) a gravity-film heat exchanger (GFX) installed in a vertical section of <b>drainline,</b> (2) a heat exchanger for capturing dryer exhaust heat, (3) a preheat tank for storing the captured heat, and (4) a small recirculation pump and controls, so that the system could be operated anytime that waste heat from the shower, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer, and in any combination was produced. The study found capturing energy from the dishwasher and clothes washer to be a challenge since those two appliances dump waste water over a short time interval. Controls based on the status of the dump valve on these two appliances would have eliminated uncertainty in knowing when waste water was flowing and the recovery system operated. The study also suggested that capture of dryer exhaust heat to heat incoming air to the dryer should be examined as an alternative to using drying exhaust energy for water heating. The study found that over a 6 -week test period, the system in each house was able to recover on average approximately 3000 W-h of waste heat daily from these appliance and showers with slightly less on simulated weekdays and slightly more on simulated weekends which were heavy wash/dry days. Most of these energy savings were due to the shower/GFX operation, and the least savings were for the dishwasher/GFX operation. Overall, the value of the 3000 W-h of displaced energy would have been $ 0. 27 /day based on an electricity price of $. 09 /kWh. Although small for today s convention house, these savings are significant for a home designed to approach maximum affordable efficiency where daily operating costs for the whole house are less than a dollar per day. In 2010 the actual measured cost of energy in one of the simulated occupancy houses which waste heat recovery testing was undertaken was $ 0. 77 /day...|$|E
40|$|Twenty seven sites, {{located in}} a range of sizes of bushland {{remnants}} (10 to > 2000 ha) and spanning a range of altitudes (0 - 500 m), were surveyed for squirrel gliders. All sites were open forest or woodland with an overstorey of eucalyptus, although the floristic composition and physical structure of the habitat varied. The gliders were present in remnants as small as 10 - 20 ha, had higher densities in remnants between 200 and 1000 ha and were restricted to altitudes below 240 m. Squirrel gliders occurred mainly in areas containing plant species typical of drier eucalyptus open forest and woodland, and were less frequently located in vegetation containing eucalyptus and other plants typical of higher rainfall areas, near rainforest or along creeks and <b>drainlines.</b> Where gliders did occur, there was a significant positive correlation between glider abundance and the density of stags (standing dead trees) and trees (> 1 m, > 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)). Squirrel gliders in southeast Queensland appear to be quite tolerant of the current level of fragmentation of their habitat, but their persistence in the longer term will depend on retaining adequate cover of lowland eucalyptus forest and woodland, particularly the spotted gum-ironbark and related vegetation types. Further decrease in forest cover may reduce habitat linkages and result in the extirpation of this species from small remnants in which they currently occur. No Full Tex...|$|R
