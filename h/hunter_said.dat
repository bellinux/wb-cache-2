5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E

On October 28, Stern announced the cancellation of all games through November 30 after negotiations regarding division of revenue ended without an agreement. He said that Hunter was unwilling [...] "to go a penny below 52%" [...] on BRI, while <b>Hunter</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We made a lot of concessions, but unfortunately at this time it's not enough." [...] Stern indicated that an 82-game season was no longer possible.

Stephen <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that Berg {{had not understood that}} the shifting tone and plot twists were meant to be humorous, and that he had played straight {{what was supposed to be}} a dark comedy and subversive satire. David Denby said Berg's style—especially his use of close-ups—was intended to showcase [...] "genuine actors at work", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times insisted Berg had taken Hancock to heart and brought gravity to the film.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{was officially}} {{started by the}} owners on July 1, 2011, during which, teams could not trade, sign or contact players, and players could not access NBA team facilities, {{trainers}} or staffs. Negotiations resumed at an August 1 bargaining session, but it fell apart after three hours. On August 2, 2011, the NBA filed two unfair labor practice claims against the NBPA, one at the NLRB and another at a federal district court in New York. The league accused the players of being uncooperative in negotiations by threatening to dissolve their union and file antitrust lawsuits. Hunter, {{in a statement released}} by the union, called the lawsuits [...] "without merit" [...] and that the union would seek to dismiss it in court.

500|$|The {{union and}} owners met again on September 13 but the {{negotiation}} soon collapsed. The salary cap structure remained {{the main source}} of disagreement. Owners wanted to create a hard cap for team payroll. The union wanted to keep the current structure intact, referring to it as a [...] "blood issue". Players were willing to cut salary only if owners agree to compromise on the salary cap. But owners were unwilling to concede, saying that there must be a system in place that allows all teams to compete. Five of the sports agents—Arn Tellem, Bill Duffy, Mark Bartelstein, Jeff Schwartz and Dan Fegan—who represent one-third of NBA players spoke with each other about decertifying the union. They believed owners have most of the leverage in negotiation and viewed decertification as a way for players to take control. <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> however that players had not considered decertification at this point.|$|E

Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] was terribly upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan <b>Hunter</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "e wanted to shoot it, but something in him didn't want to shoot it, and everybody could hear how nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E

It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but has not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game, but if there was, it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series, which is currently not under consideration. Many fans have also created their own forum-based role-playing games.|$|E

[...] He learned his trade with his brothers as they constantly played street hockey in the summers and on the ice in the winters. [...] Bentley's father flooded a sheet of ice that was the length of a regulation NHL hockey rink but much narrower, forcing the boys to develop the ability to maintain control of the puck while making fast, hard turns to reach the net. He was nicknamed the [...] "Dipsy Doodle Dandy from Delisle" [...] in reference to his ability to skate around opponents who often found {{that the only way to}} stop him was via rough play. [...] Bentley was able to score from nearly any angle, an ability that confounded even his brother Doug. [...] Long-time prairie hockey promoter Bill <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> Bentley was [...] "a phenomenal hockey player, an absolute artist with the puck". [...] Opponents occasionally attempted to use Bentley's hypochondria against him, making remarks on how he looked ill in a bid to distract him during the game.|$|E
500|$|Members of the LDS Church {{believe that}} Jesus Christ will return in glory in his Second Coming. Howard W. Hunter, who was {{president}} of the church's Quorum of the Twelve {{at the time of the}} center's construction, pointed out that although there would be no proselytizing from the center, it still served a valuable purpose. One church member quoted him this way: [...] "Elder <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that our mission was not to harvest, probably not even to plant, but to clear away a few more stones." [...] Latter-day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example, rather than by proselyting. This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives, as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers, as an example of what can be done through cooperation. During construction of the center, for example, the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time, with about 60% of them being Arab and the other 40% being Jewish. Similar cooperation continues today.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated {{that they did not know}} enough about the lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E

500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
500|$|StarClan is a {{group of}} the Clans' {{deceased}} ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured).StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the Moonpool, a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> that StarClan can [...] "just get glimpses of" [...] the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they will fade away-it is unknown what happens to them after this.|$|E
500|$|Reports of {{division}} among players and owners surfaced. Jason Whitlock of Foxsports.com wrote that Fisher was privately working with Stern on the 50–50 split and that Hunter confronted Fisher about the issue. Fisher and Stern denied {{a private meeting}} took place. In {{a letter to the}} players, Fisher called the reports [...] "absurd" [...] and demanded [...] "a retraction for the libelous and defamatory stories" [...] through his attorneys. <b>Hunter</b> <b>said</b> his [...] "relationship with Derek is very good. There was no confrontation". Fisher, as union president, is not empowered to make unilateral decisions for the union. While Fisher believed a 50–50 deal could be considered, Hunter maintained that the owners should never [...] "make the same or more than the players". Miami Heat owner Micky Arison, one of the owners willing to settle with players, responded to a fan complaining about greedy owners and players on Twitter, saying that [...] "You are barking at the wrong owner." [...] He was fined $500,000 by Stern, five times larger than any previous amount against an owner for publicly commenting on the labor situation. Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis and Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan had been fined $100,000 each for public comments on the lockout. Leonsis had commented about the owners' desire for a hard salary cap, while Jordan told an Australian newspaper that the league's business model was [...] "broken", citing the owners' desire for revenue sharing. A group of 10 to 14 hardline owners, led by Jordan, wanted to cap the players' share of BRI at 50% and as low as 47. During the labor dispute in 1998, then-player Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin, [...] "If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team." [...] Whitlock called Jordan a [...] "sellout" [...] wanting [...] "current players to pay for his incompetence". He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.|$|E
