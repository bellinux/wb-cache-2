5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1965 Britain {{engaged in}} covert {{operations}} {{in support of}} Royalist forces fighting the Egyptian backed Republican regime that had seized power in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 1962. Until the end of 1965, the British presence in Aden was considered of high interest to the United Kingdom, linked to the realization of oil assets in the Middle East. The means to secure this presence however involved a bitter argument within the British government, with no coherency <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> on the Yemen issue. The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the Federation of South Arabia, which complicated British relations with many global and regional players, {{as well as with}} the rulers of South Arabia themselves. The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization (BMO), which was capable to stage its own covert operations, independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia. The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war.|$|E

Questions asked in the study were: (1) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for male protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (2) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for female protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (3) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for male protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> and (4) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for female protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> Content analysis was used as the method of collecting data. The sample consisted of 194 novels written from 1989 to 1998, 53 of which contained a moral dilemma. A discussion of the novels included examples of moral dilemmas, alternative solutions, dilemma resolutions, and resolutions based upon care or justice. Analysis of the data revealed: (1) Female writers employ an ethic of care and an ethic of justice for male protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> (2) Female writers prefer an ethic of care for female protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> (3) Male writers prefer an ethic of justice for male protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> (4) Male writers prefer an ethic of justice for female protagonists involved <b>in</b> moral <b>decision</b> <b>making...</b>|$|R
5|$|Ralph {{suffered}} a stroke on 11 July 1119 as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly. He was still involved <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> and, in 1120, he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland's suggestion that Eadmer become the next Bishop of St Andrew's. Ralph {{was one of the}} lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121. He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king's new marriage, over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead. Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage. Ralph died on 20 October 1122, at Canterbury. He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122. His nephew, John, was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury. After Ralph's death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

The results suggest that managers use both the intuitive and analytical approaches <b>in</b> the <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> and that personality play a part <b>in</b> their <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> behavior. However, other factors such as farmsâ€™ organization, managersâ€™ formal education etc, also influence the <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> behavior of the managers...|$|R
