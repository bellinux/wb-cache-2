2500|$|David B. Woodbury (1839–1866) {{was arguably}} {{the best of the}} artists who stayed with Brady through the war. In March 1862, Mathew Brady sent Woodbury and Edward Whitney out to {{photograph}} the 1st Bull Run battlefield, and in May, views of the Peninsula Campaign. In July 1863, Woodbury and Anthony Berger photographed the Gettysburg battlefield for Brady, returning on November 19 to take [...] "pictures of the crowd and Procession" [...] (Nov. 23, 1863 letter to sister Eliza). In the summer of 1864, Woodbury photographed Grant's Headquarters Command for Brady, who had replaced Alexander Gardner as official photographer. On April 24, Woodbury assisted J.F. Coonley on the steps the Treasury Building, for the purpose of photographing the Grand Review of the Army, [...] "the plates being exposed with a <b>drop</b> <b>shutter,</b> this being the nearest thing to an instantaneous exposure with a wet plate." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} manufactured shutter was the <b>drop</b> <b>shutter</b> of the 1870s. This was {{an accessory}} guillotine-like device - a wooden panel with slit cutout mounted on rails {{in front of}} the camera lens that gravity dropped at a controlled rate. As the slit passed the lens, it [...] "wiped" [...] the exposure onto the photographic plate. With rubber bands to increase the drop speed, a 1/500 or 1/1000 s shutter speed could be reached. Eadweard Muybridge used shutters of this type in his famous trotting horse studies.|$|E

50|$|The name Zeiss Ikon {{can also}} be found in old cinemas, on fire {{shutters}} on the projection windows. These had heat fuses that melted and <b>dropped</b> the <b>shutter</b> over the hole if the film caught fire in the projection booth.|$|R
500|$|The {{problem was}} solved in July 1885 by <b>dropping</b> <b>shutters</b> between {{horizontal}} timbers {{attached to the}} viaduct piles when the tide had receded, then backing up the shutters with as much stone and earth as could be delivered from pre-loaded trucks. This worked. A cast iron pipe [...] in diameter had been laid through the dam to form a sluice, with a flap on the outside that was closed at high tide and opened as the tide receded. By this means the west part of the works were drained {{to the level of}} the pipe, and the remaining water was pumped out at an average rate of [...] per hour by a Cornish beam engine brought down from the Severn Tunnel works.|$|R

50|$|Violence spreads {{to other}} nodes, {{beginning}} with Nerul in the evening, then Koparkhairane, Baundkare, Turbhe and Vashi. Police heavy-handedness results in protests and calls to accountability by residents. Police stations in Nerul and Koparkhairane are invaded by angry mob, and a mob attempts to {{set fire to}} a police chowky. Police extend curfew to Koparkhairane, Ghansoli and Vashi. A general bandh is called in the city - public transport grinds {{to a halt and}} shops <b>drop</b> their <b>shutters.</b> Eight were arrested for participating in the violence.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{beat down}} upon the street. The shopkeepers were {{gathered}} at their doors, but their chattering was hushed as the dreaded committee passed. More than one, apparently, had tasted of its discipline. Colonel Lloyd whispered to me to keep my countenance, {{that they were not}} after very large game that morning,--only Chipchase, the butcher. And presently we came upon the rascal putting up his shutters in much precipitation, although it was noon. He had shed his blood-stained smock and breeches, and donned his Sunday best,--a white, thick-set coat, country cloth jacket, blue broadcloth breeches, and white shirt. A grizzled cut wig sat somewhat awry under his bearskin hat. When he perceived Mr. Carroll at his shoulder, he <b>dropped</b> his <b>shutter</b> against the wall, and began bowing frantically.|$|R

In this dissertation, a new evaporation speed controlling method is demonstrated using a thin liquid-film based microfluidic valve. Microfluidic droplet ejectors were designed, fabricated and {{integrated with the}} liquid-film based microfluidic valve. The thin liquid film with nonvolatility and immiscibility exhibited excellent microfluidic valve functionality without any stiction problem between valve components, and provided a very effective evaporation protection barrier for the microfluids in the device. Successful evaporation control by the liquid-film-embedded (LiFE) microfluidic valve has been demonstrated. In addition, guided actuation of the microfluidic valve along predefined paths was successfully achieved using newly developed oil-repellent surfaces, which were later used for developing ‘virtual walls’ for confining low surface tension liquids within predefined areas. Moreover, bioinspired slippery surfaces for aiding the microfluidic valve along the ejector surface have also been developed. These slippery surfaces were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing microfluidic valve driving voltages. Finally, a sliding liquid <b>drop</b> (SLID) <b>shutter</b> technique has been developed for a normally closed functionality with aid from nanostructures. The SLID shutter resolves many issues found in the previous LiFE microfluidic valve. Smooth and successful printing results of highly volatile bio-fluids have been demonstrated using the SLID shutter technique. I envision that these demonstrated techniques and developed tools have immense potential in various microfluidic applications...|$|R
60|$|When he {{returned}} that afternoon {{he was startled}} to find the cabin empty. But instead of bearing any appearance of disturbance or hurried flight, the rude interior seemed to have magically assumed a decorous order and cleanliness unknown before. Fresh bark hid the inequalities of the floor. The skins and blankets were folded in the corners, the rude shelves were carefully arranged, even a few tall ferns and bright but quickly fading flowers were disposed around the blackened chimney. She had evidently availed herself of the change of clothing he had brought her, for her late garments were hanging from the hastily-devised wooden pegs driven in the wall. The young man gazed around him with mixed feelings of gratification and uneasiness. His presence had been dispossessed in a single hour; his ten years of lonely habitation had left no trace that this woman had not effaced with a deft move of her hand. More than that, {{it looked as if}} she had always occupied it; and it was with a singular conviction that even when she should occupy it no longer it would only revert to him as her dwelling that he <b>dropped</b> the bark <b>shutters</b> athwart the opening, and left it to follow her.|$|R
