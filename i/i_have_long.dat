500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 2 March 1875, Garth {{was made}} Chief Justice of Bengal. He {{received}} a knighthood on 13 May 1875. Garth's legal opinions often {{brought him into}} conflict with the Indian and Bengal administrations, particularly with the Viceroy, the Marquess of Ripon, over the Bengal Tenancy Act and the Criminal Procedure Code Amendment Bill (the Ilbert Bill), both of which Garth publicly opposed. In May 1883, Garth sentenced Surendranath Banerjea to two months' imprisonment for libel against another of the high court's judges. He remained in the post at Fort William, Calcutta until 26 February 1886. Although he had opposed legislation which would have brought the legal rights of whites and Indians closer together, Garth was {{a supporter of the}} Indian National Congress and, in 1888, wrote a pamphlet A Few Plain Truths about India in support of the organisation's aims stating, [...] "for myself <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been persuaded that many of the abuses complained of are real and serious; and that some of the proposed reforms would be not only of advantage to India, but would materially strengthen the hands of the Government." ...|$|E
2500|$|Virginia's form of government, to {{be placed}} in its constitution, was a concern not only within its borders; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have {{preferred}} to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, [...] "your sentiments are precisely the same <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> since taken up, and they come recommended by you". But it was Mason's plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with a strong lower house of the legislature, {{to be known as the}} Virginia House of Delegates, and a weak executive, with the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, not even given the power to veto legislation. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office's lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention, by 60 votes to 45 [...] for Thomas Nelson Jr., elected him as Virginia's first post-independence governor. The election of Henry, at that time Virginia's most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities.|$|E

Blanchett was the first returning cast member from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be cast in the films, even though her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, [...] "Cate {{is one of my favorite}} actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films." [...] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a [...] "wizard" [...] in October 2010, leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown. During the production of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm. On the casting of Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael was our first choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this character." [...] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented [...] "Fran and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be joining us on this journey." [...] The casting of Brophy came after his collaboration with Jackson on several films, including Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, and all three Lord of the Rings films as various creatures.|$|E
2500|$|By 1860, {{conditions}} at Pohick Church had deteriorated {{to such a}} state that {{it is unclear whether}} or not the building remained a consecrated house of worship {{at the dawn of the}} American Civil War. With its proximity to Washington, D.C., the building was quickly embroiled in the fighting that rocked Northern Virginia. although in that year a plan was formed by a clergyman from Fairfax, Reverend R. T. Brown, to return the building to active service, a plan which was quashed by the beginning of the conflict. The 2nd Michigan Volunteers, under the command of General Samuel P. Heintzelman, raided the church on November 12, 1861. Lieutenant Charles B. Haydon was outraged at the men's behavior, describing it thus: At 8 ½ A.M. we reached the church 12 miles out. Pohick Church is a brick building built in 1773. Gen. Washington contributed to building it & was a frequent attendant. It has a very ancient look & one would suppose that it might be sacred enough to be secure. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> known that the Mich 2nd had no fear or reverence as a general thing for God or the places where he is worshiped but I had hoped that the memory of Gen. Washington might protect almost anything with which it was associated. I believe our soldiers would have torn the church down in 2 days. They were all over it in less than 10 minutes tearing off the ornaments, splitting the woodwork and pews, knocking the brick to pieces & everything else they could get at. They wanted pieces to carry away [...] [...] [...] A more absolute set of vandals than our men can not be found on the face of the earth. As true as I am living I believe they would steal Washington's coffin if they could get to it. Private Robert Sneden visited the church in January 1862. He painted a watercolor of the encampents around the building and described its condition in his journal:We reached Pohick Church about 4 pm in a snow storm [...] [...] [...] It was a substantial two story brick structure with white marble, quoins and trimmings and old colonial gambrel roof [...] [...] [...] Here Washington attended service, with all the old first families of the time [...] [...] [...] He drove from Mount Vernon to church in his coach with four horses, tandem fashion as did the others. Now the church was in ruinous condition. Windows were all broken out, doors gone, pews nearly gone, being used for firewood by our pickets. The ceilings broken by the rain coming through the roof, walls discolored black by smoke, etc. The mahogany pulpit was half cut away and carried off for relics, while the cornerstones had been unearthed and the contents carried off. Washington had lain this stone in 1765 [...] and the soldiers who got it out must have found valuable relics. There was not much left for the relic hunters now even the sconces and door knobs and hinges were gone.Confederate General J. Johnston Pettigrew also recorded visiting Pohick Church in his wartime journal.|$|E
