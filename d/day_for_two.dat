5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol four times a <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, {{and it is very}} uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

However, on December 27, 1906, she was hired by the Edison Manufacturing Company to play Daniel Boone's daughter in Daniel Boone; or, Pioneer days in America.

25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in her left eye. The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was voriconazole 200mg, twice a <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and rhinitis. The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with rhinitis. All seven individuals with rhinitis acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the collection process, S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E

Entertainments were laid on almost every <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> weeks after the wedding, in what art historian Roy Strong has called [...] "the climax of Valois festival art". The chief artist employed to design the magnificences was Antoine Caron, who was aided by the sculptor Germain Pilon. Among the writers were Dorat, Ronsard, and Philippe Desportes; and the music was written by Claude Le Jeune and the Sieur de Beaulieu, among others. A programme for an entertainment with a sun–moon theme announced that [...] "twelve torch bearers will be men and women disguised as trees...the golden fruits of which will carry lamps and torches". The visual decorations included two arcades, one shining as a sun, to represent the king, the other as a moon, to represent the newlyweds. The arcades were linked to an amphitheatre overhung with artificial heavens of planets and constellations, and allusions to Catherine’s personal emblem, the rainbow. Into this amphitheatre, the king was to enter in a chariot, dressed as the sun.|$|E

Spanish actor José Suárez was cast as Zorro in the 1953 film La montaña sin ley, and in the 1960s-70s Spanish actor Carlos Quiney (aka Charles Quiney) portrayed Zorro in three films: Zorro Il Cavaliere della Vendetta, Zorro Il Dominatore and Zorro la Maschera della Vendetta. Banderas was paid $5 million for the role. The {{character}} of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real-life Joaquin Murrieta, making the character either Mexican or Chilean. To prepare for his role, Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months, before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico, spending 10 hours a <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> months specifically on fight scenes from the film. [...] "We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, he was such a perfectionist," [...] director Martin Campbell reflected.

500|$|In {{the case}} of the Mertens' water monitor, more {{commonly}} known as Merten's water monitor, there was only one region that was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 kilometers south of Darwin, at the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, there were 14 sites set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for four weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each site visit occurred between 7:30–10:30 AM, [...] and 4:00–7:00 PM, when Varanus mertensi can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and unveiled a total of 194 sightings of Varanus mertensi in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, two months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next 4 surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, there were only two Varanus mertensi observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the water monitor abundance was at its highest {{over the course of the}} study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When you compare the two populations side by side one can see clearly that the onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the Varanus mertensi, as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] At the end of the study, some scattered population of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.|$|E
