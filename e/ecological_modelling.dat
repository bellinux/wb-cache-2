It discusses {{the benefits of}} modeling {{in the context of}} registrations, identifies the obstacles that prevent <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> being used routinely in regulatory submissions, and explores the actions needed to overcome these obstacles. The book focuses on the following issues: Uncertainties in the process of model development, such as design, analysis, documentation, and communication, The availability of data and background information needed for optimal modeling, The limited knowledge of modeling, The lack of confidence in the outcome of <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> and their reliability in pesticide risk assessment, It also suggests future solutions to these challenges, including: A guidance document on the modeling process, Case studies that show how <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> can provide reliable ecologically relevant risk assessments, Training the people who generate or evaluate results obtained by <b>ecological</b> <b>models,</b> Focusing on <b>ecological</b> <b>models,</b> such as unstructured population models, stage-structured matrix models, and individual- or agent-based models, this volume helps regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and scientists assess the risk of plant protection products in nontarget organisms...|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{this new}} focus on conservation, {{studies by the}} PSG and a newly {{established}} Scientific Advisory Committee revealed the island’s penguin population was in decline due to habitat destruction, introduced plants and animals, road traffic and disturbance in the penguin colony, however direct impacts from tourism were slight. Research indicated that introduced predators, namely foxes, were adversely effecting breeding success and adult survival, and that habitat reduction and destruction due to developments was significantly depressing the population. By the late 1970s nine out of Phillip Island’s ten little penguin colonies were extinct with the last colony restricted to the Summerland Peninsula.

In GLMM framework, empirical Bayes PQL (EBPQL) procedure {{is discussed in}} the context of approximating posterior point and interval prediction of random effects. An in-depth Monte Carlo assessment on EBPQL point and interval estimation of random effects, fixed effects, and prior parameters in univariate and bivariate (shared component) disease mapping and <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> is presented, with illustrative examples including spatial and <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> of infant mortality rates (relative uncommon events), suicide hospitalization rates (rare events) and suicide mortality rates (extremely rare events), and associated ecological risk factors in local health areas in British Columbia Canada. In particular, EBPQL interval prediction of random effects is explored by prediction uncertainty attributions with respect to uncertainties associated with estimation of random effects, fixed effects, and prior parameters. Estimation of percent attributions of EBPQL random effects prediction errors to prior uncertainty is developed {{in the context of}} GLMMs and explored in Bayesian disease mapping and <b>ecological</b> <b>models,</b> suggesting evidence that uncertainty about prior parameter(s) may have minor and negligible influence on EBPQL interval prediction of random effects in Bayesian hierarchical disease mapping and <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> of moderate Poisson observations.

40|$|This brief {{communication}} {{reports on}} the main findings of the LEMTOX workshop, held from 9 to 12 September 2007, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, Germany. The workshop brought together {{a diverse group of}} stakeholders from academia, regulatory authorities, contract research organizations, and industry, representing Europe, the United States, and Asia, to discuss the role of <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> in risk assessments of pesticides, particularly under the European regulatory framework. The following questions were addressed: What are the potential benefits of using <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> in pesticide registration and risk assessment? What obstacles prevent <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> from being used routinely in regulatory submissions? What actions are needed to overcome the identified obstacles? What recommendations should be made to ensure good modeling practice in this context? The workshop focused exclusively on population models, and discussion was focused on those categories of population models that link effects on individuals (e. g., survival, growth, reproduction, behavior) to effects on population dynamics. The workshop participants concluded that the overall benefits of <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> are that it could bring more ecology into ecological risk assessment, and it could provide an excellent tool for exploring the importance of, and interactions among, ecological complexities. However, {{there are a number of}} challenges that need to be overcome before such models will receive wide acceptance for pesticide risk assessment, despite having been used extensively in other contexts (e. g., conservation biology). The need for guidance on Good Modeling Practice (on model development, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, documentation, and communication), as well as the need for case studies that can be used to explore the added value of <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> for risk assessment, were identified as top priorities. Assessing recovery potential of exposed nontarget species and clarifying the ecological relevance of standard laboratory test results are two areas for which <b>ecological</b> <b>modeling</b> may be able to provide considerable benefit...|$|R

40|$|Background: Injury as a {{cause of}} {{significant}} morbidity and mortality has remained fairly stable in countries with developed economies. Although injury prevention often is conceptualised as a biomedical construct, such a reductionist perspective overlooks the importance of the psychological, environmental, and sociocultural conditions as contributing factors to injury and its consequences. This paper describes the potential of the <b>ecological</b> <b>model</b> for understanding the antecedent causes of unintentional injuries and guiding injury prevention approaches. We review the origins and conceptualise the elements of the <b>ecological</b> <b>model</b> and conclude with some examples of applications of ecological approaches to the prevention of unintentional injury and promotion of community safety. Methods: A review of the English-language literature on the conceptualization of <b>ecological</b> <b>models</b> in public health and injury prevention, including the application of the <b>ecological</b> <b>model</b> in the prevention of falls and road traffic injuries and in the community safety promotion movement. Results: Three dimensions are important in social-ecological systems that comprise key determinants of injuries: 1) the individual and his or her behaviour, 2) the physical environment, and 3) the social environment. Social and environmental determinants have profound impact on population health and in the causation of injuries. Conclusions: Social and environmental determinants of injury should be studied with the same energy, urgency, and intellectual rigor as physical determinants. Application of the <b>ecological</b> <b>model</b> in injury prevention shows the most promise in falls injury prevention, road traffic injury prevention, and community safety promotion...|$|R
