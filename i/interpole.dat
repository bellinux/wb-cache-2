50|$|These are two {{principal}} methods {{by which the}} effect of armature reaction is overcome.

40|$|Abstract—Large {{direct current}} {{machines}} {{have been used}} in the mining industry for many years due to their practicality and simplicity. The operational nature of DC machines causes a shift of the electrical neutral axis in the armature of the machine, changing the ideal position of the commutating brushes and possibly causing sparking. Direct current machine technology has been well developed to contain compensating windings and <b>interpoles,</b> which counteract armature reaction. However, {{there has never been a}} system designed to compensate for the rotation of the electrical neutral axis due to armature reaction. This paper outlines four alternate options, which could be used to design a device, which rotates the brushes of the machine with the changing electrical neutral axis. The paper also presents a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of such a device. The technical details of each option are identified along with a discussion of the designs. These four designs are then comparedusing an unbiased decision making tool resulting in the selection of most practical and effective design...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{automated}} mining {{systems as}} well as improved utilisation of mining equipment are largely facilitated by using online condition monitoring tools with critical mining machinery. CRC Mining DC Motor Duty Meter project supported by ACARP and industry partners addresses this objective by developing an online condition monitoring tool that relates DC motor operation conditions to its wear and maintenance needs. A unique experimental facility for full size DC motor testing has been developed as was explained in the {{paper presented at the}} CRC Mining Conference last year. Now the facility has been commissioned. Some preliminary experimental results have been obtained during short time tests. The motor performance was assessed by analysing data from a large number of sensors installed internally and externally to the motor. Mostly important, experimental data have been collected from Hall effect flux sensors installed under main poles and <b>interpoles</b> of the DC machine, and then correlated with the armature current measured in a wide frequency range.

40|$|Single phase {{switched}} reluctance machines (SRMs) have {{a special}} place in the emerging high-volume, low-cost and low-performance applications in appliances and also in high-speed low-power motor drives in various industrial applications. Single phase SRMs have a number of drawbacks: low power density as they have only 50 % utilization of windings, lack of self-starting feature unless otherwise built in to the machine, most of the times with permanent magnets or sometimes with distinct and special machine rotor configurations or additional mechanisms. Many of these approaches are expensive or make the manufacturing process more difficult. In order to overcome such disadvantages a method involving <b>interpoles</b> and windings is discussed in this research. Also, a new and novel converter topology requiring only a single switch and a single diode is realized. This research tests the concepts and feasibility of this new single-phase SRM motor topology and converter in one quadrant operation.

50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each <b>interpole</b> must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|E

50|$|Extensions and {{improvements}} to the District Railway (later the District line of the London Underground) in the early 1900s required additional rolling stock, and in 1910 Hurst Nelson received an order for 32 motor cars and 20 trailers, which were similar in both construction and appearance, and were known as C Stock. Traction control used a non-automatic electro-magnetic controller supplied by British Thomson-Houston Co., but the motors were to a new design, which included <b>interpoles.</b> They were the first use of such motors on the Underground, and probably in England. The cars were 49.5 ft long, with double doors in the centre, and single doors at either end. Much of the bodywork was made of wood. There were some problems with the motor bogies, and 60 new bogies were provided between 1910 and 1922, although not all were for the Hurst Nelson vehicles, as the problem also affected the D Stock and E Stock, which had been supplied by other manufacturers in 1912 and 1914.

40|$|Objectives: The use of {{laparoscopy}} {{to treat}} malignant hematological diseases {{is not completely}} accepted. Our aim was to analyze operative and postoperative results of laparoscopic splenectomy performed for benign versus malignant hematological disorders. Methods: Between 1994 and 2003, 76 consecutive pa-tients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. The first 38 cases were performed by using an anterior approach, whereas in the remaining 38 cases a semilateral position was used. Results: Baseline characteristics showed that patients with malignant diseases were significantly older (56. 9 vs 32. 6 years, P 0. 001). Seventy-two (94. 7 %) procedures were completed laparoscopically. Conversion was re-quired in 4 cases (5. 2 %). Mean operative time was 138. 5 minutes for benign and 151. 0 minutes for malignant dis-eases, (P 0. 05, ns). The hand-assisted technique was used in 3 patients with massive splenomegaly. Pathologic features showed that spleen volume was higher in pa-tients with malignant diseases (mean <b>interpole</b> diameter 18. 1 cm vs 13. 7 cm, P 0. 001). Massive splenomegaly (<b>interpole</b> diameter over 20 cm, weight over 1000 g) was present in 13 patients (17. 1 %); 9 had malignant diseases. Overall perioperative mortality was 1. 3 % and major post-operative complications occurred in 6 patients (7. 8 %). Postoperative splenoportal partial thrombosis was identi-fied in 9. 7 % of patients.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of inductance, {{self and}} mutual, is of considerable interest, {{especially in the}} case of d. c. machines operating in power and control systems, where the accurate prediction of the behaviour is of importance under both transient and steady-state conditions. Existing methods of measuring the inductances of the coils of a compound-wound d. c. machine with <b>interpoles</b> are compared with a view to recommending simple methods that will be suitable for all the coils from the highly-inductive shunt-field to the comparatively non-inductive armature. The thesis discusses the distinction between the transient, incremental and apparent inductances and surveys appropriate methods of measuring them. The experimental work considers and eliminates, in turn, the effects of the carbon brushes by making measurements with them in the circuit and then with direct connections to the commutator of a 5 KW machine. In all the inductance measurements the effects of direct-axis saturation and hysteresis are considered. Hay's bridge is considered to be the most convenient single method suitable for measuring all the machine self-inductances. The bridge is operated over a frequency range of 1. 66 c/s to 60 c/s to observe the effect of eddy currents in the solid iron driving flux into leakage paths at the higher frequencies. Mutual inductances are measured by a simple ammeter-voltmeter method and the variations with rotor angle of mutual inductances between the stator and direct-axis coils and the armature coil, are investigated for the purposes of commutation analysis. The polar moment of inertia of the rotor is determined by both mechanical and electro-mechanical tests. Theoretical transient curves are predicted for the machine operating both as a generator and as a motor and the curves are compared with those from actual tests. Due to the unpredictable nature of hysteresis and brush-contact effects when the machine is in normal operation, the distinction between transient, incremental and apparent inductance is found to be practically unimportant for this machine...|$|R

For the {{symplectic}} group GSp_ 2 g the Hecke eigensystems {{appearing in}} the spaces of classical automorphic forms, of a fixed tame level and varying weight, are p-adically interpolated by a rigid analytic space, the GSp_ 2 g-eigenvariety. A sufficiently small subdomain of the eigenvariety {{can be described as}} the rigid analytic space associated with a profinite algebra T. An irreducible component of T is defined by a profinite ring I and a morphism θT→I. In the residually irreducible case we can attach to θ a representation ρ_θGal(Q/Q) →GSp_ 2 g(I). We study the image of ρ_θ when θ describes a positive slope component of T. In the case g= 1 this is a joint work with A. Iovita and J. Tilouine. Suppose either that g= 1 or that g= 2 and θ is residually of symmetric cube type. We prove that Im ρ_θ is "big" and that its size is related to the "accidental congruences" of θ with the subfamilies that are obtained as lifts of families for groups of smaller rank. More precisely, we enlarge a subring I_ 0 of I[1 /p] to a ring B and we define a Lie subalgebra G of gsp_ 2 g(B) associated with Im ρ_θ. We prove that there exists a non-zero ideal l of I_ 0 such that l·sp_ 2 g(B) ⊂G. For g= 1 the prime factors of l correspond to the CM points of the family θ. Such points do not define congruences between θ and a CM family, so we call them accidental congruence points. For g= 2 the prime factors of l correspond to accidental congruences of θ with subfamilies of dimension 0 or 1 that are symmetric cube lifts of points or families of the GL_ 2 -eigencurve. Soit g= 1 ou 2 et p> 3 un nombre premier.

Un sous-domaine suffisamment petit de cette variété peut être décrit comme l'espace rigide analytique associé à une algèbre profinie T. Une composante irréductible de T est définie par un anneau profini I et un morphisme θT→I. Dans le cas résiduellement irréductible on peut associer à θ une représentation ρ_θGal(Q/Q) →GSp_ 2 g(I). On étudie l'image de ρ_θ quand θ décrit une composante de pente positive de T. Pour g= 1 il s'agit d'un travail en commun avec A. Iovita et J. Tilouine. On suppose que g= 1 où que g= 2 et θ est résiduellement de type cube symétrique. On montre que Im ρ_θ est "grande" et que sa taille est liée aux "congruences fortuites" de θ avec les transferts de familles pour groupes de rang plus petit. Plus précisement, on agrandit un sous-anneau I_ 0 de I[1 /p] en un anneau B et on définit une sous-algèbre de Lie G de gsp_ 2 g(B) associée à Im ρ_θ.

40|$|Double Potentials in Cavotricuspid Isthmus Block. Introduction: A novel mapping/ablation {{catheter}} using a coaxially ablation electrode (E) that is moveable between distal and proximal ring electrodes {{along its}} shaft {{was used to}} create a linear lesion over the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) and bidirectional block in 32 patients (21 men; age 38 – 79 years) undergoing ablation for counterclockwise atrial flutter. Methods and Results: Two bipolar electrograms (E 1 and E 2) were recorded: between E and the distal ring electrode and between E and the proximal ring electrode. <b>Interpole</b> distance varied for both as the E traversed the slide shaft. Given the catheter's concept, these bipoles are orientated exactly along the line of lesion creation. Prior to ablation, unitary bipolar electrograms were recorded along the catheter slide shaft position. As the CTI lesion was created (E moved along the catheter slide shaft in 2 -mm steps with radiofrequency energy delivered to achieve 65 °C for 60 sec at each), double potentials (DP) were observed. Interpotential distance became maximal with completion of the linear lesion and bidirectional block. DPs were noted in all these procedures. With pacing from the low septal right atrium at bidirectional block creation, interpotential timing was 140. 9 ± 15 msecand from the low right atrial free wall was 145. 13 ± 18 msec. In sinus rhythm, DP interpotential timing was less(35. 13 ± 9 msec) as activation fronts arrived from both septal and anterior atrial aspects. Conclusion: Bipolar recordings from the coaxially moveable electrode catheter provide unique electrogram data. DPs recorded during and after linear lesion creation can define conduction block across that lesion without the need for additional mapping catheters or complex mapping technology...|$|E
40|$|Submitted to Pattern Recognition LettersIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new fuzzy {{clustering}} algorithm {{based on the}} modeseekingframework. Given a dataset in Rd, we define regions of high density thatwe call cluster cores. We then consider a random walk on a neighborhood graphbuilt on top of our data points {{which is designed to}} be attracted by high densityregions. The strength of this attraction is controlled by a temperature parameterbeta > 0. The membership of a point to a given cluster is then the probability for therandom walk to hit the corresponding cluster core before any other. While manyproperties of random walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc...) havebeen shown to enventually encode purely local information when the number ofdata points grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of clustercores solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of beta influences thebehavior of our algorithm: for small values of beta the result is close to hard modeseekingwhereas when beta is close to 1 the result is similar to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by providingthe fuzzy clustering of a protein configuration dataset containing a milliondata points in 30 dimensions.

40|$|After {{decades of}} routine operation, the {{hydropower}} industry faces new challenges. Large-scale integration of other renewable sources of generation {{in the power}} system accentuates the role of hydropower as a regulating resource. At the same time, an extensive reinvestment programme has commenced where many old components and apparatus are being refurbished or replaced. Introduction of new technical solutions in existing power plants requires good systems knowledge and careful consideration. Important tools for research, development and analysis are suitable mathematical models, numerical simulation methods and laboratory equipment. This doctoral thesis is devoted to studies of the electromechanical interaction between hydropower units and the power system. The work encompasses development of mathematical models, empirical methods for system identification, as well as numerical and experimental studies of hydropower generator and power system interaction. Two generator modelling approaches are explored: one based on electromagnetic field theory and the finite element method, and one based on equivalent electric circuits. The finite element model is adapted for single-machine infinite-bus simulations {{by the addition of}} a network equivalent, a mechanical equation and a voltage regulator. Transient simulations using both finite element and equivalent circuit models indicate that the finite element model typically overestimates the synchronising and damping properties of the machine. Identification of model parameters is performed both numerically and experimentally. A complete set of equivalent circuit parameters is identified through finite element simulation of standard empirical test methods. Another machine model is identified experimentally through frequency response analysis. An extension to the well-known standstill frequency response (SSFR) test is explored, which involves measurement and analysis of damper winding quantities. The test is found to produce models that are suitable for transient power system analysis. Both experimental and numerical studies show that low resistance of the damper winding <b>interpole</b> connections are vital to achieve high attenuation of rotor angle oscillations. Hydropower generator and power system interaction is also studied experimentally during a full-scale startup test of the Nordic power system, where multiple synchronised data acquisition devices are used for measurement of both electrical and mechanical quantities. Observation of a subsynchronous power oscillation leads to an investigation of the torsional stability of hydropower units. In accordance with previous studies, hydropower units are found to be mechanically resilient to subsynchronous power oscillations. However, like any other generating unit, they are dependent on sufficient electrical and mechanical damping.

40|$|The aim of {{condition}} monitoring is to recognise {{the development of}} evolving motor faults at an early stage, so that the motor can be scheduled for repair or replacement before catastrophic failure occurs. Often in a modem industrial plant, {{the cost of an}} unscheduled shutdown of the process is very much greater than the cost of the motor itself. This thesis concentrates on the detection of stator and rotor defects in squirrel cage induction motors. Very little work has been done on the detection of these faults when the motor is supplied at variable frequency. Hardware and software approaches have previously been attempted but with limited success. An alternative method put forward here is to compute the instantaneous input power of the motor from the two line-to-line voltages and two line currents. In order to do this, specialised hardware has been developed, including a study of the suitability of different types of current transducers. The effects of open circuit and short circuit armature coils, and poor commutation of DC motors have been examined. Because the conventional current transformer cannot be used for DC, and the electrical noise inside the control cubicle of a thyristor-controlled DC motor prevents successful operation of a Hall Effect clip-on ammeter, an air core clip-on "Rogowski" coil was designed to monitor fault-related frequencies in armature and field current. In order to study the effect of open-circuit or short-circuit coil, steady-state models for the DC motor were developed using inductively coupled coils theory. Individual field and armature coils can be modelled, and the effect of faulty armature coils on the amplitude of frequency components that are introduced into armature and field current, can be predicted. To summarise, the main achievements described in this thesis are as follows: Voltage, current, and power monitoring of the induction motor • Design of fully shielded, linear phase shift, clip-on current transducer for power monitoring (It was initially designed by Mr Langman and modified by the author). • Design of a voltage and current monitoring hardware system for induction motors with assistance from the technical support group in the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Tasmania. • Theory and implementation of using input motor power for the overall check of induction motors. • Use of spectrum analysis of current or power signal to attempt to detect bearing faults. • Use of the instantaneous input power signal to detect stator and rotor defect of the motor with variable frequency supply. Current monitoring of the DC motor • Frequency spectrum analysis of armature and field current waveforms of DC motors. • Investigation of the effect of incorrect <b>interpole</b> strength, open-circuit and shortcircuit armature coils on the armature and field currents. • Numerical modelling of DC motor with open-circuit armature coil for steadystate conditions. • Numerical modelling of DC motor with short-circuit armature coil for steadystate conditions...|$|E
