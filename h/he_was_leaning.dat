25|$|Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson both took {{moderate}} positions {{designed to}} bring the South back into the union as quickly as possible, while Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans, including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, while curtailing the rights of former Confederates, such as through {{the provisions of the}} Wade–Davis Bill. Johnson followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates. Lincoln's last speeches show that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> toward supporting the enfranchisement of all freedmen, whereas Johnson was opposed to this.|$|E
25|$|Arrúe {{maintained}} {{very good}} relations with the Carlist political leader; he shared Fal’s intransigence on dynastical and anti-Francoist issues, while Fal shared and supported Arrúe’s drive to promote the Basque identity. Though in 1953 the Gipuzkoan junta was reconstituted under Ignacio Ruz de Prada and with Pablo Iturria as its secretary, it was in fact Arrúe remaining the provincial leader. One scholar suggests that Arrúe conspired against Fal, considering him too conventional in his anti-Francoist bid; {{if this is the case}} indeed, the ensuing deposition of Fal and collaborationist turn of mid-1950s caught Arrúe bitterly disappointed; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> to a Sivattista dissidence. With José María Valiente emerging as a new national jefe, in 1956 Arrúe tried to oppose his course by forming Junta del Regiones; this semi-rebellious body was bent on preventing rapprochement with Francoism and envisioned a loose alliance of Carlists, nationalists, regionalists, Catholics and even some sectors of the Falange. The junta proved to be short-lived and some of its participants soon backtracked when challenged by Valiente, but Arrúe did not. In 1957 as Gipuzkoan jefe he automatically entered the newly formed Junta de Gobierno de la Comunión and kept confronting the new leader, accusing him of betraying the Carlist spirit. In early 1959 he resigned as jefe of Gipuzkoan Carlism, quoting disagreement with policy of the new Secretariat.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E

500|$|During the engagement, Monitors turret {{began to}} malfunction, making it {{extremely}} difficult to turn and stop at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns [...] "on the fly" [...] as they bore on Virginia. Several times, Monitor received direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing nose and ear bleeding. However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, Virginia attempted to ram, but only struck Monitor a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to Virginias bow from when she had previously rammed Cumberland. Monitor was also unable to do significant damage to Virginia, possibly {{due to the fact}} that her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander John Dahlgren, the gun's designer, who lacked the [...] "preliminary information" [...] needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to [...] "pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates" [...] of various thicknesses and configurations. During the battle Stodder was stationed at the wheel that controlled the turning of the turret but at one point when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> against its side the turret received a direct hit directly opposite to him which knocked him clear across the inside, rendering him unconscious, at where he was taken below to recover and relieved by Stimers.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after Maserfield, Penda also destructively waged war against Oswiu of Bernicia on his own territory. At one point before the death of Bishop Aidan (31 August 651), Bede says that Penda [...] "cruelly ravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near" [...] and besieged the royal Bernician stronghold of Bamburgh. When the Mercians were unable to capture it—"not being able to enter it by force, or by a long siege"—Bede reports that they {{attempted}} to set the city ablaze, {{but that it was}} saved by a sacred wind supposedly sent in response to a plea from the saintly Aidan: [...] "Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda does!" [...] The wind is said to have blown the fire back towards the Mercians, deterring them from further attempts to capture the city. At another point, some years after Aidan's death, Bede records another attack. He says that Penda led an army in devastating the area where Aidan died—he [...] "destroyed all he could with fire and sword"—but that when the Mercians burned down the church where Aidan died, the post against which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> {{at the time of his}} death was undamaged; this was taken to be a miracle. No open battles are recorded as being fought between the two sides before the Winwaed in 655 (see below), however, and this may mean that Oswiu deliberately avoided battle due to a feeling of weakness relative to Penda. This feeling may have been in religious as well as military terms: N. J. Higham wrote of Penda acquiring [...] "a pre-eminent reputation as a god-protected, warrior–king", whose victories may have led to a belief that his pagan gods were more effective for protection in war than the Christian God.|$|E

500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him I am only a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E
500|$|The Army of the Rhine and Moselle {{experienced}} excruciating command {{problems in}} its early operations. The campaign of 1795 had been entirely a French failure and the difficulties the army faced, especially in 1795, {{had much to do}} with Pichegru's own situation: his competition with both Moreau and Jourdan and his disaffection with the direction in which the revolution was headed., Band 3. Leipzig 1839., pp. 495–496. [...] Originally a dedicated Jacobin, by 1794, his own intrigues had placed him in command after he had undermined Lazare Hoche the previous year, insuring his own appointment as commander of this army. As the revolution waxed and waned in its ardency, so did Pichegru: by late 1794, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> heavily toward the royalist cause. The Directory replaced him with Desaix, and later Moreau. [...] Undeniably a capable, possibly brilliant, and popular commander, Pichegru began his second campaign by crossing the Meuse on 18 October, and, after taking Nijmegen, drove the Austrians back across the Rhine. Then, instead of going into winter quarters, he prepared his army for a winter campaign, always a difficult proposition in the eighteenth century. Several brilliant actions in the winter established Pichegru's position. Pichegru's actions sometimes seemed inexplicable: although an associate, even a friend, of the recently executed Saint-Just, Pichegru offered his services to the Thermidorian Reaction, and, after having received the title of Sauveur de la Patrie ("Saviour of the Motherland") from the National Convention, subdued the sans-culottes of Paris, when they rose in insurrection against the Convention on the bread riots of 1 April 1795. When he crossed the Rhine in force in May 1795, he held the enviable position as hero of the Revolution. [...] He took Mannheim, but inexplicably he allowed his colleague Jourdan to be defeated; throughout 1796, his machinations in Paris complicated the conduct of operations in Germany by undermining the senior command confidence.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of the {{fighting}} on May 3, Hooker suffered an injury when at 9:15a.m. a Confederate cannonball hit a wooden pillar <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> against at his headquarters. He later wrote that half of the pillar [...] "violently ... in an erect position from my head to my feet." [...] He likely received a concussion, which was sufficiently severe to render him unconscious for over an hour. Although clearly incapacitated after he arose, Hooker refused to turn over command temporarily to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, and, with Hooker's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, and Sedgwick out of communication (again due to the failure of the telegraph lines), there was no one at headquarters with sufficient rank or stature to convince Hooker otherwise. This failure may have affected Union performance over the next day and may have directly contributed to Hooker's seeming lack of nerve and timid performance {{throughout the rest of the}} battle.|$|E

2500|$|Parameswara (also {{known as}} [...] "Iskandar Shah" [...] in some accounts) fled north to Muar, Ujong Tanah and Biawak Busuk before {{reaching}} a fishing village {{at the mouth}} of Bertam river (modern-day Malacca River). Legend has it that the king saw a mouse deer outwit his hunting dog into the water when he was resting under the Malacca tree. He thought this bode well, remarking, 'this place is excellent, even the mouse deer is formidable; it is best that we establish a kingdom here'. Tradition holds that he named the settlement after the tree <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> against while witnessing the portentous event. Today, the mouse deer is part of modern Malacca's coat of arms. The name [...] "Malacca" [...] itself was derived from the fruit-bearing Melaka tree (...) scientifically termed as Phyllanthus emblica. Another account of the naming origin of Malacca elaborates that during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (r. 1424–1444), the Arab merchants called the kingdom 'Malakat' (Arabic for 'congregation of merchants') because it was home to many trading communities.|$|E
