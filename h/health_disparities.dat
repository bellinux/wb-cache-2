According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 survey, 26% of Virginians are obese and another 35% are overweight. 78% of residents claim to have exercised at least once in the past three months. About 30% of Virginia's 10- to 17-year-olds are overweight or obese. Virginia banned smoking in bars and restaurants in January 2010. 19% of Virginians smoke tobacco.

For example, in China, <b>health</b> <b>disparities</b> have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children. Recently, gender-based disparities have decreased as females have begun to receive higher-quality care. Additionally, a girl’s chances of survival are impacted by the presence of a male sibling; while girls do have the same chance of survival as boys if they are the oldest girl, they have a higher probability of being aborted or dying young if they have an older sister.|$|E

This article reviews the literature that demonstrates a relationship between access to appropriate health care and reductions in <b>health</b> status <b>disparities.</b> Using comprehensive site-level data, patient surveys, and medical record reviews, the authors present an evaluation of the ability of health centers to provide such access. Access to a regular and usual source of care alone can mitigate <b>health</b> status <b>disparities.</b> The safety net health center network has reduced racial/ethnic, income, and insurance status disparities in access to primary care and important preventive screening procedures. In addition, the network has reduced low birth weight disparities for African American infants. Evidence suggests that health centers are successful in reducing {{and eliminating}} <b>health</b> access <b>disparities</b> by establishing themselves as their patients’ usual and regular source of care.

25|$|Cultural {{competence}} in healthcare {{refers to the}} ability for healthcare systems to demonstrate cultural competence toward patients with diverse values, beliefs, and behaviors. This process includes consideration of the individual social, cultural, and linguistic needs of patients for effective cross-cultural communication with their health care providers. The goal of cultural {{competence in}} health care is to reduce <b>health</b> <b>disparities</b> and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their race, ethnic background, native languages spoken, and religious or cultural beliefs. Cultural competency training is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, allied health, mental health, social work, pharmacy, oral health, and public health fields.|$|E
25|$|Age. Age {{can also}} be a factor in <b>health</b> <b>disparities</b> for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care {{expenses}} difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet. This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via Medicare.|$|E
25|$|While {{monitoring}} and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, the EPA has been enforcing their policies regarding air quality {{over the last}} decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, they often do not provide remedy for the social and <b>health</b> <b>disparities</b> created by exposure to emissions from electric power plants.|$|E

Differences in health status, health outcomes, life expectancy, and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups is well documented, referred to as <b>health</b> <b>disparities.</b> Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include {{but are not limited to}} ancestry, social identity, visible phenotype, and genetic makeup. Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone away just because she or he is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related <b>health</b> <b>disparities.</b> The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E

In 2006, Brownsville had the highest infant mortality rate in New York City (12.5 per 1,000 births), twice the overall city rate (5.9 per 1,000 births). Preterm and teenage births were also more common in Brownsville than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 13.8 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 9.0 per 1,000 citywide), and 38.5 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 23.6 per 1,000 citywide), giving the area the second-highest teenage birth rate of any neighborhood in the city. In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span (74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood. A New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community health profile the next year found that in Brownsville, the average life expectancy is more than ten years shorter than in Manhattan's Financial District. Brownsville has a high population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through Medicaid. In 2015, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 18%, which is lower than the citywide rate of 20%, and is expected to decrease in coming years because of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.|$|E

The explanation for this glaring <b>health</b> <b>disparity</b> is still unknown; although a number of different plausible factors have been offered including genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions. We favor the hypothesis that altered gene expression plays a major role in the disparity observed in prostate cancer incidence and mortality between African American and Caucasian American Males. To discover genes or gene expression pattern(s) unique to African American or to Caucasian American Males that explain the observed prostate cancer <b>health</b> <b>disparity</b> in African American males, we conducted a micro array pilot project study that used prostate tumors with a Gleason score of 6.

Gene ontology terms prevalent in African American prostate tumor/normal ratios relative to Caucasian American prostate tumor/normal ratios included interleukins, progesterone signaling, Chromatin-mediated maintenance and myeloid dendritic cell proliferation.
