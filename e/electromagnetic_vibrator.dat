They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator</b> which is mounted above and directly connected to the screening surface. Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal vibrating screen. The high frequency vibrating screens usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.|$|E

40|$|Processing {{proprioceptive}} {{information in}} the brain is essential for optimal postural control and can be studied with proprioceptive stimulation, provided by muscle vibration, during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Classic <b>electromagnetic</b> muscle <b>vibrators,</b> however, cannot be used in the high-strength magnetic field of the fMRI scanner. Pneumatic vibrators offer an fMRI-compatible alternative. However, whether these devices produce reliable and valid proprioceptive stimuli has not been investigated, although essential for these devices to be used in longitudinal research. Test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the postural response on muscle vibration, provided by custom-made fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrators, were assessed in a repeated-measures design. Mean center of pressure (CoP) displacements during respectively ankle muscle and back muscle vibration (45 - 60 Hz, 0. 5 mm) provided by an <b>electromagnetic</b> and pneumatic <b>vibrator</b> were measured in ten young healthy subjects. The test was repeated on the same day and again within one week. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess (a) intra- and interday reliability of the postural responses on respectively pneumatic and electromagnetic vibration, and (b) concurrent validity of the response on pneumatic compared to electromagnetic vibration. Test-retest reliability of mean CoP displacements during pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs= 0. 64 – 0. 90) and resembled that of responses on electromagnetic vibration (ICCs= 0. 64 – 0. 94). Concurrent validity of the postural effect of pneumatic vibration was good to excellent (ICCs= 0. 63 – 0. 95). In conclusion, the proposed fMRI-compatible pneumatic vibrator can be used with confidence to stimulate muscle spindles during fMRI to study central processing of proprioception. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: Optimal {{postural}} control {{requires the}} brain to process proprioceptive signals. To study this central processing, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) combined with local muscle vibration, a strong stimulus for muscle spindles, is of great value. Due to the high-strength magnetic field of fMRI, the use of electromotor driven muscle vibrators is problematic in this environment. Pneumatic muscle vibrators provide a fMRI-compatible alternative. However, their ability to produce reliable and valid proprioceptive stimuli has not been investigated yet. This study aimed to determine test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the postural response of pneumatic vibration on ankle and back muscles. Methods: Mean center of pressure (CoP) displacement in response to respectively ankle and back muscle vibration (45 - 60 Hz, 0. 5 mm, 15 sec) during standing on stable and unstable support surface were determined in ten healthy subjects (aged 23 ± 3 years). This test procedure was performed first with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrators,</b> and was repeated after a 5 minute break with MRI-compatible, custom-made pneumatic vibrators. The entire test was repeated within one week. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine (1) intraday and interday reliability for CoP displacement during both electromagnetic vibration and pneumatic vibration, and (2) concurrent validity of CoP displacement during pneumatic compared to electromagnetic vibration. The classification of Fleiss was used to interpret the ICC findings: ICC 0. 75 excellent reliability. Results: Intraday and interday ICC values for CoP displacement in response to ankle muscle and back muscle vibration during stable and unstable standing ranged from 0. 64 - 0. 94 for electromagnetic vibration and from 0. 64 - 0. 90 for pneumatic vibration, respectively. Concurrent validity ICC values for CoP displacement during ankle muscle vibration ranged from 0. 67 - 0. 95 during stable standing and from 0. 69 - 0. 87 during unstable standing. For back muscle vibration, concurrent validity ICC values ranged from 0. 63 - 0. 65 during stable standing, whilst the ICC values during unstable standing were not statistically significant (p> 0. 034). Discussion: Test-retest reliability for CoP displacement during pneumatic vibration was good to excellent and resembled the test-retest reliability of CoP displacement during electromagnetic vibration. The concurrent validity of pneumatic compared to electromagnetic vibration was good to excellent on ankle muscles in stable and unstable standing, and on back muscles in stable standing. This study shows that the custom-made, MRI-compatible pneumatic vibrator is able to stimulate muscle spindles during postural control reliably and validly. Consequently, this device can be used to study the central processing of proprioceptive signals in an fMRI environment. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{threshold}} determinations {{were made}} {{by means of an}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator</b> at three sites (carpal, tibial, and tarsal), which were primarily selected for examining patients with polyneuropathy. Because of the vast variation demonstrated for both vibrator output and tissue damping, the thresholds were expressed in terms of amplitude of stimulator movement measured by means of an accelerometer, instead of applied voltage which is commonly used. Statistical analysis revealed a higher power of discimination for amplitude measurements at all three stimulus sites. Digital read-out gave the best statistical result and was also most practical. Reference values obtained from 110 healthy males, 10 to 74 years of age, were highly correlated with age for both upper and lower extremities. The variance of the vibration perception threshold was less than that of the disappearance threshold, and determination of the perception threshold alone may be sufficient in most cases...|$|E

Two schemes for mixing propane with air are considered. In the first scheme, a propane-air mixture is delivered through the vibrator and is ignited at the outlet from the vibrator. In the second scheme, propane delivered through the vibrator mixes with air captured by an inlet hole in the vibrator nose prior to being also ignited by the MW discharge {{at the base of the}} vibrator. Propane combustion with efficiency of approximately 60 % was demonstrated at a mixture velocity up to 200 m/s in the combustion region.

40|$|Experiments on non {{interacting}} {{balls in}} a vibrated box are reported. In a first experiment with an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator</b> on earth or in board of Airbus A 300 of CNES, the 1 -ball dynamics exhibit little transverse motion and an intermittent quasi periodic motion along the direction {{parallel to the}} vibration. This behaviour proves a significant reduction of the phase space dimension of this billiard-like system from 11 -d to 3 -d or 1 -d. It is caused by dissipation, which generates non ergodic dynamics. This experiment exemplifies the coupling between translation and rotation degrees of freedom during the collisions with the walls, due to solid friction at contacts. This eliminates ball rotation and freezes transverse velocity fluctuations. This trends is confirmed by 3 d simulations with JJ Moreau discrete element code. A two-ball experiment performed under zero-g conditions in the Maxus 5 flight confirms the trend; the quasi-periodicity is found much greater, which is probably due to an improvement of experimental conditions. The two balls are not in perfect synchronisation showing the effect of small random noise; but the particles has never collided. This is then the normal dynamics of a gas of non-interacting dilute spherical grains in a vibrated container...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a negative-ion implanter for uniform implantation into each powder surface without particle scattering. It consists of a plasma sputter-type negative-ion source, a mass separator, an acceleration tube, a lens, X–Y deflectors, a 90 ° deflector, and a Faraday cup with an agitator. The electrostatic 90 ° deflector bends a horizontal beam to a vertical direction and leads it into the Faraday cup. The agitator is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator</b> at a frequency of 120 Hz, which mixes particles for whole surface treatment and uniform implantation. In this implanter, we obtained no scattering implantation for spherical oxide beads with diameters ranging from 5 to 1000 μm in an agitated state, and also obtained a good uniformity of implanted atoms among beads. For an application of the negative ion implantation into powders, copper ions were implanted into soda-lime glass beads and plates at conditions of 50 and 30 keV, respectively, with 1 × 1017  ions/cm 2. In linear optical properties, both implanted samples show a clear absorption at a photon energy of 2. 2 eV due to resonance absorption of copper surface plasmon.

40|$|Results {{are present}} of an {{investigation}} into the characteristics of an electric gas discharge generated in the deeply subcritical field of a quasi-optical microwave (MW) beam. The electrical gas breakdown is initiated by a tubular <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator.</b> The discharge is realized in a submerged high-speed stream of either air or a propane-air mixture. The stream flows from an internal hole in the aft end of the vibrator, which has sharpened points to serve as initiation sites. A short quartz tube covers the aft end of the vibrator to stabilize the stream. Experiments have been carried out for flow velocities in the range of several hundred meters per second. Photographs of the discharge area have been collected and measurements of the stagnation temperature {{in the wake of the}} discharge have been obtained. In this experimental configuration, the experiments show that a MW discharge is realized in the aft area of the vibrator attached to the sharpened ends of the vibrator. This discharge is shown to ignite and stabilize the combustion of a lean propane-air mixture. Complete propane combustion occurs for stream velocities smaller than some threshold value. At larger velocities in the experiments, we have observed effects of thermal choking and throttling of the stream. I...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. The processes occurring on the electrodes and in the liquid phase during the arc discharge in the liquid phase (ADL) have been considered in the present work and we explain the mechanism of carbon nanostructures (CNS) formation proposing the model based on the analysis of existing regularities in behaviour of charged particles under extreme temperature and pressure gradients. The CNS synthesis by ADL method has been performed in dielectric liquids: hydrocarbons, liquid gases (N 2, Ar, He etc.), deionized water and others. Suspension containing clusters of synthesized nanostructures has been formed by the synthesis. The efficiency of this method is sharply increased by using arc discharge in the liquid phase where powder reagent layer is used as anode. To increase the frequency of electrodes clamping and moving apart, an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator</b> {{has been used in}} this method and it brings and takes away the cathode from the powder reagent at a specified frequency. For ADL, nanostructures form simultaneously at several points on the conducting particle surface as a result of microscopic acts of arc discharge. These nanostructures are generated from the liquid phase and anode vapors and represent the product exhibiting rather interesting physical and chemical properties. Based on the analysis of the observations performed in the course of carbon nanostructures synthesis, the model of nanostructures formation by arc discharge in the liquid phase has been proposed in this paper. Presence and absence of deposit on the cathode have been explaineddc 201...|$|E
40|$|We {{modified}} the noninvasive, in vivo technique for strain application in the tibiae of rats (Turner et al,, Bone 12 : 73 - 79, 1991), The original model applies four-point bending to right tibiae via an open-loop, stepper-motor-driven spring linkage, Depending on {{the magnitude of}} applied load, the model produces new bone formation at periosteal (Ps) or endocortical surfaces (Ec. S). Due to the spring linkage, however, the range of frequencies at which loads can be applied is limited. The modified system replaces this design with an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vibrator.</b> A load transducer in series with the loading points allows calibration, the loaders 2 ̆ 7 position to be adjusted, and cyclic loading completed under load central as a closed servo-loop. Two experiments were conducted to validate the modified system: (1) a strain gauge {{was applied to the}} lateral surface of the right tibia of 5 adult female rats and strains measured at applied loads from 10 to 60 N; and (2) the bone formation response was determined in 28 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Loading was applied as a haversine wave with a frequency of 2 Hz for 18 sec, every second day for 10 days. Peak bending loads mere applied at 33, 40, 52, and 64 N, and a sham-loading group tr as included at 64 N, Strains in the tibiae were linear between 10 and 60 N, and the average peak strain at the Ps. S at 60 N was 2664 +/- 250 microstrain, consistent with the results of Turner 2 ̆ 7 s group. Lamellar bone formation was stimulated at the Ec. S by applied bending, but not by sham loading. Bending strains above a loading threshold of 40 N increased Ec Lamellar hone formation rate, bone forming surface, and mineral apposition rate with a dose response similar to that reported by Turner et al, (J Bone Miner Res 9 : 87 - 97, 1994). We conclude that the modified loading system offers precision for applied loads of between 0 and 70 N, versatility in the selection of loading rates up to 20 Hz, and a reproducible bone formation response in the rat tibia, Adjustment of the loader also enables study of mechanical usage in murine tibia, an advantage with respect to the increasing variety of transgenic strains available in bone and mineral research.
