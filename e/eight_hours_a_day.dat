5|$|In January 1894, Cripple Creek mine owners J. J. Hagerman, David Moffat and Eben Smith, who {{together}} employed {{one-third of}} the area's miners, announced a lengthening of the work-day to ten hours (from eight), with no change to the daily wage of $3.00 per day. When workers protested, the owners agreed to employ the miners for <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> – but at a wage of only $2.50.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day)</b> that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E

50|$|If an {{employee}} works six to <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> in <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{they are entitled}} to a 45-minute break; if <b>an</b> employee works <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> in <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{they are entitled to}} a one-hour break. An employee is entitled to one holiday per week unless they otherwise receive four or more holidays within every period of four weeks. Overtime pay must be provided for any work over <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> per day, over 40 hours per week or on holidays. Regulations provide that the overtime premium must be at least 25% for additional work on a workday, 35% for holiday work and an additional 25% for work late at night (usually defined as 10 PM to 5 AM).|$|R
5|$|Werber {{imposed a}} stern {{training}} regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for six to <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for several months, {{sending them to}} prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by {{all three of the}} musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

She wrote <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> despite {{a growing list of}} health problems, including arthritis so severe that she had difficulty even sitting at her typewriter or turning on her desk lamp. Many of these poems were never finalized and only a few were published in her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The Building Trades Council (BTC) of San Francisco, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of P. H. McCarthy, won the eight-hour day in 1900 when the BTC unilaterally declared that its members would work only <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for $3 a day. When the mill resisted, the BTC began organising mill workers; the employers responded by locking out 8,000 employees throughout the Bay Area. The BTC, in return, established a union planing mill from which construction employers could obtain supplies– or face boycotts and sympathy strikes if they did not. The mill owners went to arbitration, where the union won the eight-hour day, a closed shop for all skilled workers, and an arbitration panel to resolve future disputes. In return, the union agreed to refuse to work with material produced by non-union planing mills or those that paid less than the Bay Area employers.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} of making daechu-cha: boiling dried jujubes or {{diluting}} the preserved jujubes into boiling water. Preserved jujubes {{can be made by}} simmering dried—preferably sun-dried— jujubes on low heat for about <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> to <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> until the liquid becomes sweet and syrupy. A pre-made sweet jujube syrup is also commercially available in Korean grocery stores.|$|R

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2013 {{during a}} meeting with {{evacuees}} from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents {{would be allowed to}} return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.|$|E
25|$|When Winchester died, {{all of her}} {{possessions}} (apart {{from the}} house) were bequeathed to her niece and personal secretary. Her niece then took everything she wanted and sold the rest in a private auction. It supposedly took six trucks working <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for six weeks to remove all of the furniture from the home, an account disputed by Winchester's biographer. Mrs. Winchester {{made no mention of}} the mansion in her will, and appraisers considered the house worthless due to damage caused by the earthquake, the unfinished design and the impractical nature of its construction. It was sold at auction to a local investor for over $135,000, and subsequently leased for 10 years to John and Mayme Brown, who eventually purchased the house. In February 1923, five months after Winchester's death, the house was opened to the public, with Mayme Brown serving as the first tour guide. Harry Houdini toured the mansion in 1924 and the newspaper account of his visit (displayed in the rifle museum on the estate) called it the Mystery House.|$|E

Holden states that the chances of both such hands appearing in one deal are [...] "a laughable" [...] 332,220,508,619 to 1 (more than 332 billion to 1 against) and goes on: [...] "If these two played 50 hands of stud an hour, <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> five days a week, the situation would arise about once every 443 years." ...|$|E

500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
