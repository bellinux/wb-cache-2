This paper shows how a change from conventional gear-type couplings to the more recent <b>diaphragm</b> <b>coupling</b> design can lower the shaft stresses sufficient to avoid shaft replacement during power uprates of centrifugal compressors or compressor drivers. Equipment uprate projects involving turbomachinery often appear to require time consuming and costly shaft replacements. However, closer examination of how the equipment vendor arrived at his maximum allowable stress levels may frequently show that such shaft replacements can be avoided without undue risk if the coupling selection is optimized. This conclusion {{is based on the}} fact that gear-type coupling have the potential of inducing in a shaft both torional stresses and bending stresses, whereas diaphragm couplings tend to primarily induce torisonal stresses and insignificant bending stresses at best. The economic incentives of finding ways of salvaging major rotating equipment shafts illustrated on a steam turbine shaft originally rated to transmit 17, 600 hp maximum at 6, 400 rpm. If uprating the turbine to 19, 600 hp were being considered, the required changeout of stationary steam path components would cost around $ 60, 000, but a combined replacement cost of about $ 500, 000 would probably be quoted for the main and spare rotor shafts.

40|$|Microphone arrays {{have been}} widely used in sound source {{localization}} for many applications. In order to locate the sound in a discernible manner, the separation between microphones needs to be greater than a critical distance, which poses a fundamental constraint for the miniaturization of directional microphones. In nature, animal hearing organs are also governed by the size constraint; the smaller the organ size, the smaller the available directional cues for directional hearing. However, with an auditory organ separation of only 520 µm, the fly Ormia ochracea is found to exhibit remarkable ability to pinpoint its host cricket at 5 kHz. The key to this fly's phenomenal directional hearing ability {{is believed to be the}} mechanical coupling between the eardrums. This innovative solution can inspire one to find alternative approaches to tackle the challenge of developing miniature directional microphones. The overall goal of this dissertation work is to unravel the underlying physics of the fly ear hearing mechanisms, and to apply this understanding to develop and study novel bio-inspired miniature directional microphones. First, through mechanics and optimization analysis, a fundamental biological conclusion is reached: the fly ear can be viewed as a nature-designed optimal structure that is endowed with the dual optimality characteristic of maximum average directional sensitivity and minimum nonlinearity, at its working frequency of 5 kHz. It is shown that this dual optimality characteristic is only achievable when the right mechanical coupling between the eardrums is used (i. e., proper contributions from both rocking and bending modes are used). More importantly, it is further revealed that the dual optimality characteristic of the fly ear is replicable in a synthetic device, whose structural parameters can be tailored to work at any chosen frequency. Next, a novel bio-inspired directional microphone with mechanically <b>coupled</b> <b>diaphragms</b> is designed to capture the essential dynamics of the fly ear. To study the performance of this design, a novel continuum mechanics model is developed, which features two coupling modules, one for the mechanical coupling of the two diaphragms through a beam and the other for each <b>diaphragm</b> <b>coupled</b> through an air gap. Parametric studies are carried out to explore how the key normalized parameters affect the performance of this directional microphone. Finally, this mechanics model is used to guide the development of a large-scale microphone and a fly-ear sized microphone, both of which are experimentally studied by using a low-coherence fiber optic interferometric detection system. With the large-scale sensor, the importance of using proper contribution from both rocking and bending modes is validated. The fly-ear sized sensor is demonstrated to achieve the dual optimality characteristic at 8 kHz with a ten-fold amplification in the directional sensitivity, which is equivalent to that obtainable from a conventional microphone pair that is ten times larger in size. To best use this sensor for sound source localization, a robotic platform with a control scheme inspired by the fly's localization/lateralization scheme is developed, with which a localization accuracy of better than ± 2 degrees (the same as the fly ear) is demonstrated in an indoor lab environment. This dissertation work provides a quantitative and mechanistic explanation for the fly's sound localization ability for the first time, and it provides a framework for the development of fly-ear inspired acoustic sensors that will impact many fronts...|$|R

First, in the experimental part of the study, four coupling beams with different reinforcements were manufactured and tested. Then, after the failure of the specimens, two of them were rehabilitated and strengthened with CFRP sheets, and retested. Four specimens were constrained longitudinally in order to evaluate the effect of the slab <b>diaphragm</b> on the <b>coupling</b> beam behavior.

Test results show that the CFRP sheets can increase the shear strength of the conventional reinforced coupling beams.

40|$|Because of the {{anatomic}} {{association of}} an exceptionally bulky stomach with a striking compartmentation {{of the chest}} wall, leading to the most cranial insertion of the diaphragm among mammals, gastric overdistension in the bovine species offers a unique pathophysiological condition for the diaphragm. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether increased intragastric pressure (Pga) (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 kPa) leads to perturbations of respiratory and diaphragm function in calves. Changes in diaphragmatic strength and inspiratory action followed a biphasic pattern: 1) transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) in response to constant bilateral maximal phrenic nerve stimulation at 30 Hz increased with moderate gastric distension and then fell abruptly as Pga continued to rise and 2) the magnitude of the ratio of the fall in pleural pressure to total Pdi was maintained up to a Pga amounting to 2 kPa but declined at higher pressures. We conclude that gastric distension in the bovine species provokes physiologically significant alterations of the <b>diaphragm</b> excitation-to-pressure generation <b>coupling</b> as well as of its capacity to convert Pdi into useful inspiratory pleural pressure.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{simulation of}} flow conditions encountered by aircraft {{is imperative to}} the development of aeronautics and astronautics. Test flights are expensive and time consuming, thus, ground based test facilities provide the majority of data in new flight regimes. A mixture of analytical studies, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), experimental results from ground based test facilities and actual atmospheric flights are required to obtain important design parameters. Coupled with this need for aerodynamic information, is a constant desire to simulate higher flow speeds. Expansion tubes provide an option for testing aeroshells such as the new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) or the high enthalpy end of scramjet flight regime. A unique opportunity already exists in which the fabricated hardware for the RHYFL shock tunnel could be utilized to create the worlds largest expansion tube, RHYFL-X. This thesis continues a project which attempted to investigate if RHYFL-X would be a beneficial experimental tool. This thesis began by installing and commissioning a new single-stage, free-piston driver for the X 2 expansion tube located at the University of Queensland. The new configuration provided a smaller scale version of the RHYFL-X expansion tube on which testing could be performed. It also provided a number of advantages which would lead to increased performance in the X 2 facility. Once installation was complete, a series of experiments was conducted to ensure that the new driver configuration was operating correctly and to determine the capabilities of it. Four conditions were examined. Two air conditions which produced secondary shock speeds of 8. 14 km/s and 8. 61 km/s, a condition to simulate the entry into the Titan atmosphere at 5. 51 km/s and another condition to simulate entry into the Jovian atmosphere at 10. 2 km/s. Numerical one-dimensional models were examined along with hybrid simulations, which used the one-dimensional model up to rupture of the secondary <b>diaphragm</b> and then <b>coupled</b> this to an axisymmetric simulation of the acceleration tube. The results from these numerical simulation models compared well to the experiments and showed that the new driver provided {{a significant increase in the}} stagnation pressures that could be generated in the expansion tube over the old two-stage, free-piston driver. There have been claims in previous studies that an expansion tube nozzle would not only increase the core flow diameter but also the steady time available for testing. However, this claim has never been physically demonstrated. A full-capture, contoured, shockfree nozzle was designed for the new X 2 configuration. The design code for the nozzle incorporated a flow solver for the Parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations coupled to a Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. A 1. 4 m nozzle was installed at the end of the acceleration tube and a series of experiments conducted. CFD simulations similar to the hybrid method mentioned above were conducted with the nozzle attached. The experiments again matched well with the numerical models. The results indicated that the addition of the nozzle produced a larger core flow diameter and longer test time as had been claimed. However, the improvements were not as significant as predicted by the axisymmetric simulations. Extremely large boundary layers were formed but sufficient core flow was still generated to enable the testing of models. Both the addition of a single-stage, free-piston driver and a contoured nozzle has significantly increased the capabilities of the X 2 expansion tube. The numerical models that are used in this thesis provide an excellent basis for the prediction of the flow that can be generated in the X-series of expansion tubes located at the University of Queensland. Following the success of this project, the larger X 3 expansion tube located at the University of Queensland is going to be refurbished with a single-stage, free-piston driver and a nozzle...|$|R
