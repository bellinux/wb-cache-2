40|$|Laser-induced desorption/ionization from silicon {{nanowires}} (SiNW) is {{an emerging}} method for mass spectrometry of small to medium-size molecules. In this new technique, {{we examined the}} <b>internal</b> energy <b>transfer</b> to seven benzylpyridinium thermometer ions and extracted the corresponding internal energy distributions. To explore {{the effect of the}} energy-deposition rate on the <b>internal</b> energy <b>transfer,</b> two lasers with significantly different pulse lengths (4 ns vs 22 ps) were utilized as excitation sources. A comparison of ion yields indicated that the SiNW substrates required 5 - 8 times less laser fluence for ion production than either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) or desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS). In contrast however, the survival yield (SY) values showed that the <b>internal</b> energy <b>transferred</b> to the thermometer ions was more than (ps laser) or comparable to (ns laser) MALDI but it was significantly less than in DIOS. The <b>internal</b> energy <b>transfer</b> was only slightly dependent on laser fluence and on wire density. These effects were rationalized in terms of the confinement of thermal energy in the nanowires and of unimpeded three-dimensional plume expansion. Unlike in MALDI from CHCA and in perfluorophenyl-derivatized DIOS, for desorption from SiNWs the effect of laser pulse length on the <b>internal</b> energy <b>transfer</b> was found to be negligible...|$|R

40|$|Non-intrusive {{measurements}} of the <b>internal</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient {{in the core of}} a randomly packed bed of uniform spherical particles are made.   Under steady, one-dimensional flow the spherical particles are subjected to a step change in volumetric heat generation rate via induction heating.   The fluid temperature response is measured.   The <b>internal</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient is determined by comparing the results of a numerical simulation based on volume averaging theory (VAT) with the experimental results.   The only information needed is the basic material and geometric properties, the flow rate, and the fluid temperature response data.   The computational procedure alleviates the need for solid and fluid phase temperature measurements within the porous medium. The <b>internal</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient is determined in the core of a packed bed, and expressed in terms of the Nusselt number, over a Reynolds number range of 20 - 500.   The Nusselt number and Reynolds number are based on the VAT scale hydraulic diameter,.   The results compare favorably to those of other researchers and are seen to be independent of particle diameter.   The success of this method, in determining the <b>internal</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient in the core of a randomly packed bed of uniform spheres, suggests that {{it can be used to}} determine the <b>internal</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient in other porous media...|$|R
