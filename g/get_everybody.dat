Some popular characters, such as Wolverine, were not added, because of Gaiman's vision to address the heroes of the 1960s. [...] "The territory doesn't go much further than 1969 in terms of the characters that I picked to use," [...] Gaiman noted. [...] "I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> in because {{there are an awful lot}} of Marvel characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe {{is that when we}} <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E

[...] In an interview with BlackFilm.com, Ice Cube stated that he would be interested in involving all major characters from the Friday franchise in a possible sequel, but added [...] "I know I'm not going to get Chris [...] back, but I'd love to <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> else back." [...] As of December 2011, Chris Tucker has agreed to be in Last Friday.|$|E
2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough to <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|E

5000|$|The Dreamland Café was {{released}} in 1995, the band's final studio album. It continued the trend of softer, Beatleseque powerpop-oriented rock. This is also the only disc where Roger plays drums. In an interview, Roger {{said that there were}} songs where he did everything, and it {{was the result of a}} small budget and having a hard time <b>getting</b> <b>everybody</b> together. Thematically, he said the album could be interpreted [...] "as a metaphor for the Church, or...Christianity or Christ...it's a little metaphor for...the optimistic, hopeful side of Christianity." ...|$|R

60|$|Towards humbling or {{extinguishing}} Austria, Belleisle has two preliminary {{things to}} do: FIRST, Break the Pragmatic Sanction, and <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> to break it; SECOND, Guide the KAISERWAHL (Election of a Kaiser), {{so that it}} issue, not in Grand-Duke Franz, Maria Theresa's Husband, as all expect it will, but in another party friendly to France:--say in Karl Albert of Bavaria, whose Family have long been good clients of ours, dependent on us for a living in the Political World. Belleisle, there is little doubt, had from the first cast his eye on this unlucky Karl Albert for Kaiser; but is uncertain as to carrying him. Belleisle will take another if he must; Kur-Sachsen, for example;--any other, and all others, only not the Grand-Duke: that is a point already fixed with Belleisle, though he keeps it well in the background, and is careful not to hint it till the time come.|$|E
60|$|DEAR THOMPSON: A tirade {{is still}} kept up against me here for recommending T. R. King. This morning it is openly avowed that my {{supposed}} influence at Washington shall {{be broken down}} generally, and King's prospects defeated in particular. Now, what I have done in this matter I have done {{at the request of}} you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me. If the truth will permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy the inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me. Also, have six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me individual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand it. Don't neglect or delay in the matter. I understand information of an indictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming or keeping a gaming house, has been sent to the department. I shall try {{to take care of it}} at the department till your action can be had and forwarded on.|$|E

6000|$|But {{is it true}} {{that all}} the {{difficulty}} and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from office-seeking, from the mere ambition of politicians? Is that the truth? How many times have we had danger from this question? Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise. Go back to the nullification question, at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question. Go back to the time of the annexation of Texas. Go back to the troubles that led to the Compromise of 1850. You will find that every time, with the single exception of the Nullification question, they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution. There never was a party {{in the history of this}} country, and there probably never will be, of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country. Parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves. But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles? Does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder? What divided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North and South? What has raised this constant disturbance in every Presbyterian General Assembly that meets? What disturbed the Unitarian Church in this very city two years ago? What has jarred and shaken the great American Tract Society recently, not yet splitting it, but sure to divide it in the end? Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power that somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society,--in politics, in religion, in literature, in morals, in all the manifold relations of life? Is this the work of politicians? Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it? If you will <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will quit before they have half done so. But where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century, which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions,--I say, where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it, and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it? Yet this is the policy here in the North that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care nothing about it! I ask you if it is not a false philosophy. Is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about--a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about? ...|$|E
