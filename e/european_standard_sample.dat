40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the PM 10 levels {{measured}} at an urban residential background site in New Belgrade, in Omladinskih Brigada Street, at 15 m height (roof). The aerosol {{samples were collected}} using a <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> <b>sampler,</b> in four seasonal campaigns conducted in autumn: Nov. 13 -Dec. 03, 2007, winter: Feb. 07 - 28, 2008, spring: May 06 - 28, 2008 and summer: July 17 - -August 15, 2008. The results were compared with PM 10 mass concentrations measured with a Horiba automatic station at street level, at the same sampling site and at three more sites within the Belgrade municipal monitoring network. The {{results show that the}} PM 10 values in the Belgrade urban area were high during autumn and winter campaigns (heating season) with a number of samples exceeding the 24 -h limit value of 50 μg m- 3. On the roof station, a maximum daily value of 209 μg m- 3 was measured in the autumn campaign, with 14 values out of 20 measurements exceeding the 24 -h limit. In winter, 14 out of 19 measurements exceeded the limit, with a maximum value of 196 μg m- 3. During the spring campaign, the number of exceedances was three out of 22. All values during the summer campaign were below 50 μg m- 3. The roof station equipped with the <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> instrument showed systematically higher values than the street-level automatic monitor. PM 10 values at all sites followed the same trend. The highest concentrations at all monitoring sites were observed during the autumn, Nov. 20 - 25, 2007, and winter, Feb. 19 - 23, 2008...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{was used}} to study the corrosion behavior {{of different types of}} commercial quality epoxy polyamide dry coatingson mild steel, with thickness between 150 and 250 ▫$/mu$▫m, which were previously weather accelerated in a wet chamber. The following data were established on the basis of impedance curves and corresponding equivalent circuits: the coating capacity that relates to the coating dimension, the pore resistance that represents conductive paths through the pores, and Warburg coefficients, which are the measure of ion diffusion through the coating. EIS data were compared with a criterion in the <b>European</b> <b>standard,</b> and <b>samples</b> were classified {{on the basis of their}} quality, also receiving a final ranking by summing-up all the individual rankings.

40|$|In this paper, {{the levels}} of twenty one {{elements}} (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, S, Se, Sr and Zn) in PM 10 are presented, as well as SO 2 concentration, measured at the sampling site in an urban area {{of the town of}} Bor (40, 000 inhabitants) in eastern Serbia. The sampling site was located in a densely populated city center about 0. 65 km away from one of the largest copper mines and copper smelters in Europe. For the first time PM 10 was collected using the <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> <b>sampler,</b> during a preliminary campaign in duration of 7 days in early spring 2009. PM 10 were sampled on PTFE membrane filters and element concentrations were quantified by GF AAS and ICP AES. Concentration levels and correlations within trace elements, PM 10 and SO 2 indicated that industrial activities underpinned with meteorological conditions of low wind speed (calm) are the main factors that influence air pollution in a densely populated area. It was evident that both PM 10 mass concentration and SO 2 concentration once exceeded the daily limit values during a measuring period of seven days. Strong relationship was found between PM 10 and Mn, Mg, Ca and B daily average concentrations. On the other hand, SO 2 correlated strongly with As, Pb, Cd, Cu and S daily average concentrations. These results confirm the relationship between emissions of SO 2 from the Copper Smelter Bor and calm meteorological conditions (wind speed less than 0. 5 m/sec) with the concentration levels of carcinogenic substances of arsenic, lead and cadmium in ambient air...|$|R

40|$|Cabo Verde {{is located}} on the West African coast, was {{discovered}} uninhabited by Portuguese explorers, colonized by European and African slaves and is culturally characterized by a mixture of their settlers. Cabo Verde is one of the countries with the highest number of emigrants living in Portugal. In order to validate the genetic markers included in the Combined DNA Index System and in the <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> Set, <b>samples</b> from 500 unrelated individuals from Cabo Verde, currently living in Lisboa, were studied with the PowerPlex® Fusion System. To implement the genotyping method at the Serviço de Genética e Biologia Forenses (SGBF) we determined the minimum final volume of the PCR reaction, the proper number of PCR cycles and the minimum DNA concentration to obtain a complete genetic profile. Stutter identification and its proportion and allelic imbalance within markers were also determined. Results were compared with genetic profiles obtained by the current PCR kits used in SGBF routine testing verifying concordance between common loci. There were no off-ladder alleles detected and it was possible to type microvariants which were not present in the allelic ladders of other PCR kits. PowerPlex® Fusion System allows for the simultaneous characterization of Combined DNA Index System and in the <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> Set genetic markers, in an economically way, with greater sensitivity and solid results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} a study aiming at quantifying the evolution in the flow rate of exposed and protected oxidized bituminous geomembranes with an adaptation of the <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 14150. <b>Samples</b> were taken from dams and ponds between 2000 and 2006. The age of the geomembranes could reach 30 years. The flow rate through exposed oxidized bituminous geomembranes has dramatically increased as compared to virgin geomembranes, by a factor larger than 3500 in some cases. In case of the geomembrane located under water, only a one order magnitude increase in the flow rate was noticed. For the protected geomembrane, no increase was noticed. In all those cases but one, cracks were located at the surface of the geomembrane. It thus seems that cracks themselves are not a sufficient indication of the level of ageing of the geomembrane and that hydraulic tests are a useful tool to evaluate the ageing of bituminous geomembranes. From the results presented in this paper it is not recommended to use exposed oxidized bituminous geomembranes if one wants to ensure that the initial level of watertightness be maintained on the long term...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} application of periphytic diatoms to water quality assessment at a regional level, {{there is no}} <b>standard</b> <b>European</b> <b>sampling</b> protocol or associated assessment metrics. Furthermore, relatively {{little is known about}} the uncertainty in the results of such assessments. One of the objectives of the European project for the Standardisation of River Classifications (STAR) is to improve and standardise diatom assessment methods. An extensive diatom ring test, together with an audit of the project results, provided a better understanding and quantification of the uncertainty in quality assessment of running waters using diatoms. The variation in multimetric analysis shows that the choice of site and substrate for sampling, the inter-operator differences in diatom taxonomy and the counting techniques are the primary sources of uncertainty. To some extent, this variation also reveals the robustness of specific metrics in relation to the sources of uncertainty. Of the three most common substrate types tested (stone, macrophyte and sediment), macrophytes emerge as the most preferred substrate for diatom sampling when performing multimetric water quality assessment...|$|R
