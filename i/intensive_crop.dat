50|$|All {{of these}} {{elements}} of modern agriculture {{are used in the}} context of the traditional <b>intensive</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns. To maximize year-round use of the land, two or more crops are planted each year where possible. Rice, wheat, cotton, vegetable, and other crop seedlings are sometimes raised in special seedbeds and then transplanted to fields. Transplanting shortens the time required for a crop to mature, which allows farmers the opportunity to squeeze in an additional crop each growing season. Another method to make optimum use of scarce land is to plant seedlings in a mature stand of another crop. For example, when planting winter wheat in October, farmers in the north leave spaces among the rows so that cotton seedlings can be planted or transplanted in April and May. Without intercropping, farmers could raise only one crop a year. Mechanization supports this <b>intensive</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern. Despite a huge rural labor force, labor shortages occur each season when farmers are required to harvest one crop and plant another in its place, all within the space of a few weeks. In the 1980s farmers invested in harvesting and planting machinery to overcome the shortage of labor. Seed breeders also supported <b>intensive</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns by selecting and breeding varieties that had shorter growing seasons.|$|R

However, the optimum nutrient management measures for this new system are lacking. Here, we present a detailed study of the effects of NPK fertilizers on yield and quality of forage, nutrient uptake and soil properties in this rotation system through a three-year field experiment conducted in Jianghan Plain from April 2005 to May 2008. The results showed that the NPK combination obviously improved the yield of sudangrass and ryegrass. Total yields in NPK treatments were 162. 7, 114. 8 and 145. 6 Mg ha- 1 in the three years, respectively, and were obviously higher than PK, NK, NP and CK treatments (P < 0. 05). In addition, NPK fertilization also improved quality and the nutrient uptake of forage grasses, and N, P and K uptake for NPK treatments was higher than for other treatments. Nutrient output for forage grasses meant the depletion of soil nutrient, and NPK combination fertilization maintained nutrient balance and soil fertility in this <b>intensive</b> <b>cropping</b> system, also decreased excess nutrient in soil.

The study was based on evaluation of soil constituents, structure and functions as affected by time. Run-off plots were used in two locations at different stages of soil degradation. Degraded soils were characterized by a low organic carbon content (around 0. 2 %) in its upper 10 cm, a high erodibility, and a high compaction of the upper layers when not recently tilled. Restoration of productivity on these soils should start by aerating and stabilizing the compacted layers. Only then can fertilizer application and other improvements be profitable. Soil mulching after tillage and incorporation of farm manure, adoption of conservation tillage practices and short duration fallows, allow restoration of productivity on these degraded soils.

Studies on K release kinetics and Q/I parameters showed that cumulative K release was higher in K treated soils as compared to untreated ones thereby causing a greater decline in non exchangeable K reserves.
