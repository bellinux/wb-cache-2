40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{document}} the challenges and value of animal draft oxen power in the Eastern Caprivi region in Namibia. The authors documented the use and value of these animals, using Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) Techniques, with qualitative and economic analysis. Furthermore, various data sources, including crop enterprise budgets, project reports, expert opinions and group discussions, were used. The findings of the study showed that in the Eastern Caprivi 81 % of the farmers used oxen, with an additional 8 % using oxen and tractors. Nine percent of the farmers used tractors, and only 2. 2 % used a hand hoe exclusively. Eighty-three percent felt that the use of oxen was an essential and sustainable farm power source. Farmers were facing multitude of challenges such as crop damage and loss due to wildlife from nearby conservancies, oxen lost to theft, disease and starvation, as well as high farm input and energy costs. Tractors were out of reach for all but the most affluent farmers. The highest yields per farm were achieved with tractors, largely due to farm size, followed by mixed power (oxen and tractors, then oxen, and finally the <b>hand-hoe.</b> However, when viewed on a per ha basis, as well as looking at costs of production and tractor ownership, ox farmers in some constituencies outperformed all others in gross profit.

40|$|Since 1996, {{a growing}} {{coalition}} of stakeholders {{from the private}} sector, government and donor communities has promoted a new package of agronomic practices for smallholders in Zambia. The conservation farming (CF) system they advocate involves: dry-season land preparation using minimum tillage methods (either ox-drawn rip lines or <b>hand-hoe</b> basins {{laid out in a}} precise grid of 15, 850 basins per hectare); no burning but rather retention of crop residue from the prior harvest; planting and input application in fixed planting stations; and nitrogen-fixing crop rotations. The CF system enables farmers to plant with the first rains when seeds will benefit from the initial nitrogen flush in the soil. By breaking pre-existing plow-pan barriers, the CF basins and rip lines improve water infiltration, water retention and plant root development. The precise layout of grids and planting lines enables farmers to locate fertilizer and organic material in close proximity to the plants, where they will provide greatest benefits. Evidence from similar technologies in other parts of Africa suggests that the effectiveness of conservation farming will vary not only across regions but also across crops and over time, due to variations in weather and rainfall. In addition, many of the benefits of CF [...] including improved soil structure, gains from nitrogen-fixing crop rotations and reduced field preparation labor [...] occur gradually and over time. Therefore, it will be important to establish long-term monitoring efforts for conservation farming and control plots across a broad range of geographic settings, crops and seasons.

Four herbicides, Bullet (chloroacetanilide, dimethanamid, triazine), Harness 90 EC (chloroacetanilide), Codal Gold 412 - 5 EC (prometryn and S-metolachlor) and Metalachlor 960 EC (S-metolachlor; acetamide), were evaluated with and without follow up <b>hand-hoe</b> weeding (check). Panicum maximum, Elusine indica, Rottboellia chochinchinensis and Setaria pumila were the common narrow-leaved weeds while Commelina benghalensis, Bidens pilosa, Nicandra physalodes and Acanthospermum hispidum were the common broad leaved weeds. Herbicide application did not affect crop establishment but significantly (P< 0. 001) reduced early weed growth by 74. 8 to 91. 2 % at Chitedze and 53. 7 to 97. 9 % at Chitala. Bullet was more effective in early weed control (2. 8 weeds m- 2 at Chitedze and 0. 0 weeds m- 2 at Chitala) than the other herbicides (38. 7 weeds m- 2 at Chitedze and 8. 8 weeds m- 2 at Chitala) and resulted in root yields (12. 3 t ha- 1 at Chitedze and 18. 4 t ha- 1 at Chitala) and returns (MK 238, 844. 00 ha- 1 at Chitedze and MK 360, 779. 00 ha- 1 at Chitala) comparable to or higher than hand weeding (root yield of 10. 6 t ha- 1 at Chitedze and 16. 3 t ha- 1 at Chitala and returns of MK 2 0 1, 4 3 8. 0 0 h a - 1 a t Ch i t e d z e a n d MK 310, 448. 00 ha- 1 at Chitala) and other treatments (root yield of 2. 2 - 13. 1 t ha- 1 at Chitedze and 1. 3 - 23. 6 t ha- 1 at Chitala and returns of MK 44, 000. 00 to MK 249, 078 at Chitedze and MK 26, 000. 00 to MK 465, 100 ha- 1 at Chitala), making it a potential alternative to hand hoe weeding in cassava...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of Eucalyptus wood biochar (B, pyrolyzed at 550 °C, at 0 or 2. 5 tha− 1), green manure (T, from Tithonia diversifolia at 0, 2. 5 or 5. 0 tha− 1) and mineral nitrogen (U, urea, at 0, or 120 kgNha− 1) on soil respiration, aggregate size distribution and SOC in these aggregate size fractions in a 2 -year field experiment on a low-fertility Ultisol in western Kenya under conventional <b>hand-hoe</b> tillage. Air-dry 2 -mm sieved soils were divided into four fractions by wet sieving: Large Macro-aggregates (LM; > 1000 μm); Small Macro-aggregates (SM, 250 – 1000 μm); Micro-aggregates (M, 250 – 53 μm) and Silt+Clay (S+C,[*]< 53 μm). We found that biochar alone did not affect a mean weight diameter (MWD) but combined application with either T. diversifolia (BT) or urea (BU) increased MWD by 34 ± 5. 2 μm (8 %) and 55 ± 5. 4 μm (13 %), respectively, compared to the control (P= 0. 023; n= 36). The B+T+U combination increased the proportion of the LM and SM by 7. 0 ± 0. 8 %, but reduced the S+C fraction by 5. 2 ± 0. 23 %. SOC was 30 %, 25 % and 23 % in S+C,M and LM/SM fractions, and increased by 9. 6 ± 1. 0, 5. 7 ± 0. 8, 6. 3 ± 1. 1 and 4. 2 ± 0. 9 gkg− 1 for LM, SM, M and S+C, respectively. MWD was not related to either soil respiration or soil moisture but decreased with higher SOC (R 2 = 0. 37, P= 0. 014, n= 26) and increased with greater biomass production (R 2 = 0. 11, P= 0. 045, n= 33). Our data suggest that within the timeframe of the study, biochar is stored predominantly as free particulate OC in the silt and clay fraction and promoted a movement of native SOC from larger-size aggregates to the smaller-sized fraction in the short-term (2 years) ...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{is increasingly}} promoted in southern Africa {{as a strategy}} to improve food security and reverse soil degradation {{in the face of}} climate change. However, the performance of CA under different environments and its ability to improve ecosystem services is still unclear. The effects of the CA options; direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins on maize grain yield, soil health and profitability across agro-ecological regions in Zimbabwe were evaluated through a review of literature in combination with meta-analysis. Overall, CA improved maize yield over conventional agriculture. Compared to conventional agriculture, direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins increased yield by 445, 258 and 241 kg ha− 1, respectively. However, there was an initial yield decline in the first two years. CA practices reduced soil erosion and bulk density, and increased soil water content in most studies. Under high levels of residue retention (6 Mg ha− 1), CA systems exhibited greater macro fauna abundance and diversity than conventional agriculture, particularly termites. Weed pressure tended to increase labour requirement for <b>hand-hoe</b> weeding under CA compared to conventional agriculture. However, the use of herbicides reduced weeding labour demand during the early season. The benefits of CA are tied to the farmers’ management intensity including: time of planting, weeding, fertiliser and herbicide application, and adequate training on equipment use. Economic analysis results showed that on average, a farmer incurs losses for switching from conventional agriculture to CA in the main maize growing regions of Zimbabwe. Based on the six seasons’ data, the losses were least with the ripper in drier areas and worst with the direct seeder in wetter areas. Incorporation of chemical herbicides worsens the economic returns of CA tillage options in all the agro-ecological zones. Overall, the study showed that the rip-line seeding is more attractive in the drier areas than direct seeding. Although not costed in this study, critical is the cumulative reversal of soil degradation associated with consistent CA practice which can sustain agriculture. Results from this review suggest that the benefits of CA depend largely on the type and context of CA being practised. It is thus imperative to profile the technology, the farmer socio-economic circumstances and the bio-physical environment in which the farmer operates for proper geographical and beneficiary targeting to achieve greater impact. More longer-term studies are required to fully elucidate the benefits and context of CA options and practice...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{based on}} <b>hand-hoe</b> prepared planting basins is being widely promoted in southern Africa, targeting resource-constrained farmers with {{limited access to}} draft power. This study was conducted across 15 districts covering four agro-ecological zones in Zimbabwe where paired CA and conventional animal drawn tillage (CADT) plots had been established on 450 farms as part of CA promotion. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the effect of CA on soil pH, organic C, total P and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield compared with CADT, and also to evaluate the yield benefits of mulching and crop rotation in CA with or without mineral fertilizer use. It was hypothesized that CA improved the pH, organic C, total P of the soils (Arenosols) and grain yield compared with CADT and that mulching and crop rotation in CA increased maize grain yield. A total of 1014 soil samples (0 – 0. 2 m depth) were taken at the end of the 2009 / 10 cropping season and analyzed for pH, organic C and total P. Grain yield was determined in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 from 0. 01 ha net plots. There was no significant difference in average soil pH, total P and organic C between CA and CADT plots and therefore the hypothesis that CA improves these soil properties was rejected. Average concentration for organic C for both CA and CADT plots was less than 10 g kg− 1, a minimum threshold for well managed soils. When combined with mineral fertilizer: mulching, crop rotation, and mulching + crop rotation in CA increased maize grain yield by 20 – 33 %, 7 – 9 % and 58 – 69 %, respectively. With no mineral fertilizer application, mulching, crop rotation, and mulching + crop rotation depressed maize grain yield by 48 %, 28 % and 36 %, respectively. Therefore the hypothesis that mulching and crop rotation increase maize grain yield was accepted when mineral fertilizer was added and rejected when the fertilizer was not added. It was concluded that the yield benefits of CA can only be realized when mineral fertilizer is also applied. All the three CA principles in combination with mineral fertilizer results in highest yield benefits compared with one or two principles as currently done by most smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. Access to mineral fertilizer is an important factor in the targeting of CA promotion in smallholder areas of Zimbabwe and similar socio-ecological zones in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} {{based on}} hand hoe dug planting basins {{has been widely}} promoted {{for the last decade}} or two in the smallholder farming sector of southern Africa targeting resource constrained households without access to draft power. In Zimbabwe planting basins are used by about one hundred thousand households but on small plots (< 0. 5 ha) although most are unable to adopt soil surface mulching and crop rotation due to competing uses for crop residues as livestock feed and poorly developed markets for other crops, respectively. We report on the effects of reduced tillage based on <b>hand-hoe</b> dug planting basins (PB) on weed growth (20 farms), and labor demand and returns to investment (50 farms) compared with animal-drawn mouldboard plough based conventional tillage (CONV) in maize (Zea mays L.) fields, across selected districts located in contrasting agro-ecological zones in Zimbabwe. Weed growth was assessed through a survey conducted {{at the end of the}} 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 cropping seasons. Labor demand and returns to investment were measured on 50 farms across five districts using direct observations during the 2011 / 12 cropping season. The survey showed that farmers on average weeded their PB plots 2. 7 times per season compared to 1. 7 – 1. 9 times in CONV plots (P < 0. 001), and timing was often delayed in the former. Reduced tillage plots had 17 % (P < 0. 001) more weed ground cover and 9 % (P < 0. 05) more weed dry matter compared with CONV plots in the 2009 / 10 season, and differences in 2010 / 11 were not significant. Weed growth was highest in semi-arid areas (natural regions III and IV) compared with wetter sub-humid areas (natural region II) and arid areas (natural region V). Farmers planted their PB plots 12 – 23 days earlier, weeding frequency was 42. 1 – 58. 9 % higher in PB plots, compared with CONV. Labor demand was more than double under PB (84. 7 man days ha− 1, weeding 48. 1 man days ha− 1) compared to CONV (38. 6 man days ha− 1). However, returns to investment were 42. 7 % higher under PB (U$ 1. 77) compared with CONV (U$ 1. 24). Weed growth and labor demand remained high under PB tillage even after several years, interventions such as the use of alternative weed control methods need to be introduced to farmers to reduce labor demand and consequently increase its adoption both in terms of number of farmers and cultivated area in southern Africa...|$|E
