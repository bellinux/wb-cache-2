50|$|The {{northern}} caiman <b>lizard,</b> <b>Dracaena</b> guianensis, is {{a species}} of lizard found in northern South America.|$|R
50|$|The {{caiman lizard}} is built {{similarly}} to its cousin the tegu, {{with a large}} heavy set body and short but powerful limbs. Its head is bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. It also has a few adaptations that help it in its watery habitat. It has a long, laterally flattened tail, similar to its name sake, the yacare caiman. The long tail helps the caiman lizard to successfully swim and dive. It also has a clear third eyelid which is thought {{to act like a}} pair of goggles underwater.The coloration of the northern caiman <b>lizard</b> (<b>Dracaena</b> guianensis) is very similar to that of a crocodile. It is typically a bright green with slight dark green banding. The Paraguayan caiman <b>lizards</b> (<b>Dracaena</b> paraguayensis) are typically much more drab, with gray bodies and heads. There are tough raised scutes along the dorsal portion of the back. These give the caiman lizard a crocodilian appearance, and help to provide some protection against predators. These lizards can become up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 lbs.|$|R

50|$|C. maculosus is {{endemic to}} the three largest dry salt lakes of inner South Australia (Lake Eyre, Lake Callabonna, and Lake Torrens), with the densest {{population}} found in Lake Eyre. Three habitat characteristics characterize its distribution: a surface crust, {{a thick layer of}} dry sand or clay under the crust, and a constant source of humidity. This <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> inhabits the edges of the lakes where it burrows in the damp sediments under the salt crust.|$|R
50|$|The sungazer (Smaug giganteus, syn. Cordylus giganteus), {{also known}} as the giant girdled <b>lizard</b> or giant <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> or giant zonure, is the largest species of the Cordylidae, a family of lizards from Sub-Saharan Africa. This {{threatened}} species is endemic to Highveld grasslands in the interior of South Africa. In 2011, it was assigned to the new genus Smaug along with seven other species previously belonging to the genus Cordylus, based on a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the Cordylidae.|$|R
5000|$|Ctenophorus maculosus, {{commonly}} known as the Lake Eyre <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> or salt-lake ground-dragon, is a species of agamid lizard endemic to South Australia. C. maculosus mainly inhabits the edges of salt lakes in South Australia, from which its common names are derived. It survives in this harsh habitat through adaptive mechanisms to tolerate high temperatures and lack of free water. [...] The female C. maculosus possesses unique male rejection techniques which are currently the focus of further research.|$|R

50|$|In {{support of}} the Charnov and Bull hypothesis, Warner and Shine (2008) showed {{confidently}} that incubation temperature influences males’ reproductive success differently than females in Jacky <b>Dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Amphibolurus muricatus) by treating the eggs with chemicals that interfere with steroid hormone biosynthesis. These chemicals block the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol during development so each sex offspring can be produced at all temperatures. They found that hatching temperatures that naturally produce each sex maximized fitness of each sex, which provides the substantial empirical evidence in {{support of the}} Charnov & Bull model for reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{eradication}} of dingos {{and the establishment of}} permanent waterholes for stock, the numbers of red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos and euros in the Flinders Ranges have increased. The yellow-footed rock-wallaby, which neared extinction after the arrival of Europeans due to hunting and predation by foxes, has now stabilized. Other endemic marsupials include dunnarts, planigales. Echidnas are the sole monotreme species in the park. Insectivorous bats make up significant proportion of mammals in the area. Reptiles include goannas, snakes, <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards,</b> skinks and geckos. The streambank froglet is an endemic amphibian.|$|R
25|$|There {{are more}} than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found {{throughout}} the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the thorny devil, bearded <b>dragon</b> and frill-necked <b>lizard.</b> There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they {{are commonly known as}} goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2m in length.

40|$|Variation in {{exposure}} to sex hormones during early development contributes to phenotypic plasticity in vertebrate offspring. As a proposed marker for prenatal sex hormone exposure {{and because of}} their association with various physiological and behavioral characteristics, digit ratio and/or digit length have received notable interest {{within the field of}} evolutionary ecology. However, the validity of digit measures as a proxy of prenatal sex hormone exposure is controversial and only few studies have provided direct evidence for the link between digit development and prenatal sex hormones. Here, we report morph- and sex-specific variation in digit ratio in wild painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Ctenophorus pictus). Lizards expressing a yellow bib have significantly larger third-to-fourth toe ratios (3 D: 4 D) than lizards without a bib. Males have significantly smaller 3 D: 4 D than females. Furthermore, we show that experimental elevation of yolk testosterone significantly increases 3 D: 4 D in hatchling painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards,</b> but has no influence on hatchling size. Our results provide direct and indirect evidence for the involvement of prenatal sex steroids in digit development and it is suggested that digit ratio may be used as a biomarker for prenatal steroid exposure in this reptilian species. As such, digit ratio may provide a useful tool to study temporal or spatial differences in the proximate hormonal mechanisms modulating physiological and behavioural phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Polymorphism {{within the}} same species, population, and sex is an {{interesting}} problem for the evolutionary biologist, since differences in fitness between the morphs have to cancel out over evolutionary time, otherwise morphs of lower fitness would become extinct. One way this may be achieved is through the adoption of different morph-specific reproductive strategies, allowing morphs to become conditional specialists in space (co-existing) or in time (and cycle in frequency). In either case, we expect selection to be disruptive on data pooled across morphs. Question: In the annual Australian painted <b>dragon</b> <b>lizard</b> (Ctenophorus pictus; less than 10...|$|R
40|$|Examination of size-free {{body shape}} {{for males and}} females of 41 species of Western Australian <b>dragon</b> <b>lizards</b> (Agamidae) {{indicate}} that males generally have a proportionally longer head, and females a proportionally longer abdomen. Principal component and cluster analyses show that size-free body shape differences between males and females are neither uniform nor consistent within the Agamidae, or the genus Ctenophorus. This inconsistency is problematic when linking morphological characteristics with performance traits, use of space, or preferred habitat for species. We recommend that male and female dragons are treated separately in morphological analyses, but acknowledge that this increases the complexity of analyse and interpretations...|$|R
