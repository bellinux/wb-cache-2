5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and <b>irreproachable</b> behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, an {{administrative}} report praised Charvet for constantly seeking high-novelty {{and setting the}} trend for other Parisian shirtmakers, having <b>irreproachable</b> manufacturing standards, and successfully enticing French factories to produce the raw materials traditionally supplied by England.|$|E
25|$|The medal {{could be}} awarded to {{selected}} Royal Navy and Royal Marines ratings after altogether 21 {{years of service}} and <b>irreproachable</b> behaviour, counted from the man’s twentieth birthday for Navy ratings and from his eighteenth for Marines.

25|$|Killigrew is {{best known}} for being the subject of John Dryden's famous, extolling ode, which praises Killigrew for her beauty, virtue, and {{literary}} talent. However, Dryden was one of several contemporary admirers of Killigrew, and the posthumous collection of her work published in 1686 included several additional poems commending her literary merit, <b>irreproachable</b> piety, and personal charm.|$|E
25|$|The Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) {{was awarded}} to non-commissioned {{officers}} and men who had completed eighteen years of <b>irreproachable</b> service {{in the ranks of}} the Natal Police or the Permanent Force of the Natal Colonial Forces. A recipient who was subsequently awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, had to stop wearing the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.|$|E
25|$|The medal was {{initially}} awarded to {{soldiers in the}} ranks of the Regular Force who had completed 21 years of service in the infantry or 24 years in the cavalry. From 1870 the qualifying period was reduced and the medal was awarded to Regular Force non-commissioned officers and men who had completed eighteen years of <b>irreproachable</b> service, irrespective whether the service was in the infantry or the cavalry.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from <b>irreproachable</b> musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Hopley, aged 41 at {{the time}} of the incident, was a {{schoolmaster}} in Eastbourne who ran a private boarding school out of his home at 22 Grand-parade. [...] He was well educated and from a middle-class family, the son of a Royal Navy surgeon and brother of artist Edward Hopley. [...] His household was fairly well off, and he and his wife kept several servants. [...] Hopley was described by Algernon Charles Swinburne as [...] "a person of high attainments and <b>irreproachable</b> character". [...] He expressed [...] "utopian" [...] educational ideals shared by many Victorian educational theorists. He wrote pamphlets on education topics which included [...] "Lectures on the Education of Man", [...] "Help towards the physical, intellectual and moral elevation of all classes of society", and [...] "Wrongs which cry out for redress" [...] advocating the abolition of child labour.|$|E
500|$|Stalin called {{everyone}} who didn't {{agree with him}} an [...] "enemy of the people." [...] He said {{that they wanted to}} restore the old order, and for this purpose, [...] "the enemies of the people" [...] had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be {{a knock on the door}} in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, <b>irreproachable</b> people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never! ...|$|E
500|$|American {{historian}} Dana Munro {{wrote in}} her study about Latin America that PedroII [...] "grew up to be serious minded, <b>irreproachable</b> in his private life, and indefatigable {{in the performance of}} what he considered his duty." [...] She added that he was [...] "an able and intelligent ruler if not a great statesman". Another American historian writing on Brazilian history, Thomas Skidmore, remarked that the Emperor [...] "brought a natural talent to his work. Even at age 14, he was steady, equilibrated and discrete". He states that during [...] "his reign, he acquired the reputation of being just and objective, projecting the image of an honest and ethical sovereign who would not hesitate in disciplining politicians who were caught turning away from his strict standards". The British historian Roderick. J. Barman wrote in his biography of PedroII that he [...] "was at once the model emperor and the model citizen. He literally and metaphorically towered above his fellow Brazilians. PedroII's achievements at home and the high reputation he established abroad convinced Brazilians that the goals he advocated would create a country as powerful and as civilized as France, Great Britain or the United States".|$|E
500|$|The motet {{is marked}} Allegro moderato and begins calmly in homophony. Max Auer {{notes that the}} {{beautiful}} work has touches with Mozart's Ave verum. A. Crawford Howie notes further that the work [...] "begins with Mozartian phrases, but soon introduces characteristic Brucknerian progressions". The repeat of the first line, beginning one step higher, is marked mf, confirming [...] "" [...] higher and stronger, then repeating it softly. The bass begins each [...] "". Musicologist Anthony Carver notes here as in many of Bruckner's motets the [...] "isolation of the bass part at structurally important points". The bass also begins the second line with a new rising motif, marked f; the upper voices follow in homophony. The line is repeated as a sequence a step higher, marked ff. After a pause of half a bar, the tenor alone begins in sudden pp the middle section on a repeated note, imitated by soprano and alto. Throughout the section, only the upper voices, without a bass foundation, sing in chromaticism, beginning in undefined tonality. In a gradual crescendo, the intensity is heightened, but only to mf. Iso Camartin notes in an article dedicated to {{the work in the}} Neue Zürcher Zeitung: das unanfechtbare Geheimnis (the <b>irreproachable</b> mystery) appears as unfassbar (incomprehensible) and beunruhigend (disturbing), described by Ryan Turner as [...] "transparently chromatic".|$|E
500|$|Crossland {{was named}} in the initial twelve-man squad for the first Test against Australia, which was played at Lancashire's Old Trafford ground. An {{official}} from the home ground chose the England team for each match. Lord Harris {{announced that he would}} not participate in the Test at Old Trafford if Crossland was selected. As a result, Lord Harris was withdrawn from the team and replaced by Tim O'Brien, although in the end Crossland did not play either. Lord Harris, who was both the captain of Kent and England in 1884, led the protests against throwing. He forced the retirement of two of Kent's bowlers, but was reasonably satisfied with Lancashire in 1884: for their match against Kent at Old Trafford, they dropped Nash, and by the meeting of the two sides in August that year, neither Crossland nor Nash were in the side. Lord Harris had hoped that this indicated that Lancashire were making efforts to [...] "of [...] own free will, and without agreement with other counties, to place [...] eleven in an <b>irreproachable</b> position", though Lancashire later clarified that Crossland had only missed the match as he was suffering from a shoulder injury; while Nash's bowling was not suited to the hard pitches those matches were played on. Crowd protests against Crossland spread; there was trouble during matches at both Yorkshire and Derbyshire in 1884. Towards the end of that season, the London Truth reported that during a club match in his home town of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Crossland was no balled by an umpire on account of throwing. Upon this, Crossland demanded the umpire retire from the match, and when the opposing captain refused, the match was abandoned. Crossland then announced, via the town crier, that his bowling would [...] "pass unquestioned" [...] in his next county match.|$|E

2500|$|But {{all these}} moderations {{of the rule}} {{disappeared}} on holidays; then an especially worthy hazzan was demanded, one whose life was absolutely <b>irreproachable,</b> who was generally popular, and who was endowed with an expressive delivery. Even {{a person who had}} ever litigated in a non-Jewish court, instead of a Jewish court, could not act as hazzan on those days, unless he had previously done penance. However many authorities were lenient in this regard, and as long as a cantor was [...] "merutzeh l'kehal," [...] desired by the congregation, he was permitted to lead the prayers even on the holiest of days.|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, the ten-year-old Marie was {{introduced}} to the piano teacher Heinrich Herz at the Paris Conservatory. [...] After just four months as an official student at the Conservatory, she won the [...] First Prize of Piano.

[...] Her higher mechanism, her beautiful style, her play deliciously moderate, with an <b>irreproachable</b> purity, an exquisite taste, a lofty elegance, constantly filled the audience with wonder." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{inscription}} in Syracuse {{dedicated to}} Euskia mentioning St Lucy's Day {{as a local}} feast {{dates back to the}} 4th century A.D., which states [...] "Euskia, the <b>irreproachable,</b> lived a good and pure life for about 25 years, died on my Saint Lucy's feast day, she for whom I cannot find appropriate words of praise: she was a Christian, faithful, perfection itself, full of thankfulness and gratitude". The Feast of Saint Lucy became a universal feast of the Church in the [...] 6th century, commemorating the Christian martyr's death on 13 December 304 A.D. St. Lucy's Day appears in the sacramentary of Gregory, {{as well as that of}} Bede, and Christian churches were dedicated to Saint Lucy in Italy as well as in England.|$|E
2500|$|As an example, Buñuel {{has told}} {{about one of}} his {{experiences}} with cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, a veteran who had become famous in cinematography circles by making a specialty of illuminating {{the beauty of the}} Mexican landscape using photographic chiaroscuro (stark contrast between illuminated space and dark shadows). [...] Figueroa had set up a shot for Nazarín near the valley of the Popocatépetl: [...] "It was during this shoot that I scandalized Gabriel Figueroa, who had prepared for me an aesthetically <b>irreproachable</b> framing, with the Popocatépetl in the background and the inevitable white clouds. I simply turned the camera to frame a banal scene that seemed to me more real, more proximate. I have never liked refabricated cinematographic beauty, which very often makes one forget what the film wants to tell, and which personally, does not move me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colin McArthur {{writes that}} Braveheart [...] "constructs Wallace {{as a kind}} of modern, {{nationalist}} guerrilla leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state." [...] Writing about Bravehearts [...] "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made [...] "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as [...] "the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to conscription and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve." [...] Canitz posits that depicting [...] "such lack of class solidarity" [...] as the conscriptions and related hangings [...] "would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally <b>irreproachable</b> primus inter pares among his peasant fighters." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{months of}} {{exploration}} in the Pacific, the ship visited many islands in Polynesia. On their {{arrival in the}} Marquesas Islands, the crews found ways [...] "to socialise" [...] with the islanders. Dumont's moral conduct was <b>irreproachable,</b> but he provided a highly summarised description of some incidents of their stay in Nuku Hiva in his reports. [...] During the voyage from the East Indies to Tasmania some of the crew were lost to tropical fevers and dysentery (14 men and 3 officials); but for Dumont the worst moment during the expedition was at Valparaiso, where he {{received a letter from}} his wife that informed him of the death of his second son from cholera. [...] Adélie’s sorrowful demand that he return home, coincided with a deterioration in his health: Dumont was more and more often hit by attacks of gout and stomach pains.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Schellenberg met Reinhard Heydrich {{and worked}} {{for him in the}} {{counter-intelligence}} department of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Besides his native German, Schellenberg also spoke French and English fluently. Correspondingly, his first foreign-intelligence assignment was to Paris in 1934, where his role was to check up on the political views of a professor. Then in 1937, Schellenberg was sent to Italy for a police assignment which included security duties for an upcoming visit by Mussolini; his outstanding work in providing security garnered positive attention from Heydrich, who then tasked him with additional organizational responsibilities, some of which later helped give birth to the RSHA. The official SS personnel report on Schellenberg described him as [...] "open, <b>irreproachable,</b> and reliable"; the file also delineated him as [...] "firm, tough, possesses energy" [...] and one who was [...] "very sharp thinking"; and his National Socialist worldview was labeled, [...] "thoroughly fortified." [...] Many of the SS street-brawling types despised men like Schellenberg, considering them effete, {{but for the most part}} Schellenberg made a good impression on the Nazi elite.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, while {{assessing}} the conclusions drawn by Sămănătorismul and being inquired by Daniel Cristea-Enache about the book's implications, Ornea discussed {{the paradox of}} his stated admiration for Iorga, the Sămănătorist theorist and historian. Acknowledging that Iorga's political thought signified [...] "xenophobic nationalism" [...] and evidenced that its proponent was a [...] "constant antisemite", Ornea assessed that, nevertheless, the same intellectual figure stood out for rejecting more violent forms of antisemitism, and was an outspoken adversary of the radically fascist Iron Guard. In parallel, he noted, Iorga's scientific and literary contribution were <b>irreproachable,</b> making informal references to the historian as [...] "apostle of the nation" [...] entirely justified. Ornea discussed such aspects {{in contrast to the}} legacy of interwar Trăirist philosopher and Iron Guard sympathizer Nae Ionescu, who introduced a theoretical separation between, on one hand, Romanians of the Orthodox faith, and, on the other, Romanians of other creeds and the ethnic minorities. Such distinctions, Ornea noted, [...] "defy the spirit of democratic tolerance", and were used by Ionescu himself as an ideological weapon not just against Jews such as Mihail Sebastian, but also against the Romanian Greek-Catholic man of letters Samuil Micu-Klein and the liberal current's founding figure Ion Brătianu.|$|E
2500|$|While the Anton Pann {{narrative}} earned {{appreciation for}} freely mixing picturesque elements into a historical novel framework, Dan's solo debut with Dragoste și moarte... takes direct inspiration from Gustave Flaubert. The book {{is seen by}} Ovid Crohmălniceanu as [...] "a good reconstruction of a particular human ambiance, with a suggestion regarding the forms of Bovarysme that envelop [...] setting." [...] The more complex Arsenic can be read, according to Crohmălniceanu, as both a thriller populated with [...] "dubious" [...] figures and, [...] "under careful reading", a study [...] "on the petty cowardice of existence." [...] The protagonist is a physician who renounces his professional standard, assists his friend, the simple giant Bibi, in plotting {{the murder of a}} common enemy, and then lives to regret his deed, while, at the same time, he betrays Bibi's confidence by pursuing an affair with his wife Ana; Ana however cheats on both men with the president of an insurance company. Călinescu remarks that the novel was constructed with an [...] "intelligent" [...] rhythm of suspense and humor, noting the [...] "fantasy" [...] invested in the secondary plots and characters: the colonel who dies obsessing about fodder, his bourgeois daughters, or the coroner who constructs absurd theories about criminal behavior. Arsenic received high praise from Crohmălniceanu: [...] "The book is written with much confidence, it displays remarkable intellectual detachment, fine Voltairian irony and an ingenious, <b>irreproachable,</b> counterpoint construction." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Construcția identității într-o societate totalitară, seen by Cernat as [...] "a study {{up to the}} {{international}} standards" [...] and a work of [...] "entomological precision", Dan Lungu focuses on how writers and intellectuals related to ideological pressures, explores in particular the theme of [...] "resistance through culture" [...] (as opposed to outspoken dissidence). The thesis advanced by Lungu is that Romania's pre-communist authoritarian traditions accompanied Westernization, and therefore failed to rally the society around the notion of legality. Paraphrasing the author's conclusions, Cernat writes: [...] "The 'voluntarist and elitist' projects of emancipation, the intellectuals' paternalistic Bovarysme, {{the destruction of the}} traditional model of the village and the partial assumption of modern values in the urban environment, the weakness of civil society have all facilitated adaptation to the Stalinist and, later, national-communist models [...] Hence the duplicity, the lack of solidarity among the 'resisters' within a patriarchal, mostly rural, country..." [...] Historian Cristian Vasile sees Lungu's study as akin to the contributions of anthropologist Katherine Verdery, in that it defines the writers' individual roles in [...] "the process of transforming society and creating the new man", while serving as an investigation of social identity constructs. Vasile quotes the book for its conclusions about the impact of agitprop, socialist realism and censorship on Romanian literature and education, including a corroboration of the censors' own dissatisfaction with their activity, or the link Lungu establishes between the spread of atheism and the communist version of science education. A distinct section of the essay refers to the tradition of Jewish Romanian literature, and in particular to the Jewish impact on modernist literature. In his review of the chapter, Cernat discussed the [...] "relevant—if at times exaggerated—conclusions" [...] Lungu draws on minority authors having been pushed by their social marginalization into becoming the cultural avant-garde. In Cernat's view, Construcția identității... "imposes itself through span, seriousness and an <b>irreproachable</b> professionalism", but suffers from [...] "a savant jargon which limits [...] reception to the circle of specialists." ...|$|E
