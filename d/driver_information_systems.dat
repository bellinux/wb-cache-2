40|$|This project {{focuses on}} route {{planning}} algorithms for Advanced <b>Driver</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (ADIS), {{which are also}} known as Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). Route planning has been approached by graph-theoretic algorithms for all-pair (transitive closure) and single-source (partial transitive) path computations. These algorithms compute many more paths beyond the single-pair path that is of interest to ATIS, and hence may not be satisfactory for ATIS due to the dynamic nature of edge costs (travel-time). For single-pair path computation, we explore specialized algorithms such as A*, which are designed to reduce irrelevant computation and to quickly discover the shortest paths. Our cost models and performance studies show that single-pair algorithms can outperform traditional algorithms in many situations. 1 INTRODUCTION Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) assist travelers with planning, perception, analysis and decision making to improve the convenience, safety a [...] ...|$|E
