5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E

The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3.

5|$|Tracing {{its history}} {{back to the}} 1870s, the Ghetto now {{includes}} more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, high-density housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, {{there are more than}} 400 houses currently used as student residential space. Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update the Ghetto, and several additional changes to the neighborhood are <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming years as part of the university's Master Plan.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had been <b>expected.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line.

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been <b>expected.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR– in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. 37,000 people used the line on the first day, but {{in the months following}} the line's opening only about 20,000–30,000 passengers a day used the service. The number of carriages used by the BS was cut back to three per train at peak times and only two during off-peak hours. The Daily Mail reported in April 1906 that the rush-hour trains were carrying fewer than 100 people at a time. To add to the line's misfortunes, it suffered its first fatality only two weeks after opening when conductor John Creagh was crushed between a train and a tunnel wall at Kennington Road station on 26 March.|$|E

In March 2004, with a federal election <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
