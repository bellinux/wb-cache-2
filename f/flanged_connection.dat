40|$|The {{deflections}} of gaskets {{after initial}} tightening largely affect the residual bolt {{forces and the}} tightness of bolted flanged connections. The bolt forces decrease significantly due to the deflections of gaskets after initial tightening in the cases where expanded PTFE gaskets are used. The visco-elastic characteristic of the gaskets is the main cause for the phenomenon. It was shown in the paper PVP 2012 - 78694 that the tightness improved even if the bolt forces reduced in the long term. This is because the gasket becomes packed under a high gasket stress. It is important to estimate the thickness change of gaskets to evaluate the tightness of bolted flanged connections. In this paper, an analytical model of a bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connection,</b> in which the flanges, the bolts and the gasket are represented by spring constants, is proposed. Experiments were carried out to measure the creep characteristic of the expanded PTFE gasket. The residual bolt forces and the deflection of the gasket were estimated based on the analytical model of the bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> and the creep characteristic of the gasket. Thus, the relationship between gasket deflection and the tightness of the bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> are clarified...|$|E
40|$|The {{functioning}} of an essential facility, {{such as a}} hospital, after an earthquake relies heavily on proper {{functioning of}} its nonstructural components such as fire suppression and water distribution systems, elevators and medical equipment. In recent earthquakes, nonstructural components in hospitals and medical buildings have suffered {{a large amount of}} damage, which resulted in a significant reduction of the functionality of the facilities. This paper presents findings from shake table experiments on typical hospital piping systems. A welded and a threaded piping system were tested with and without seismic restraints. The research identifies the capacity characteristics of a hospital piping system with and without bracings as well as the system’s weak points. Both systems were tested to the ICBO AC 156 acceptance criteria for nonstructural components. Results show that the braces limited the displacements of both systems, but they did not significantly reduce the accelerations. The input motion of 1 g was amplified to 2. 6 g at the top of all of the systems. There was no significant damage to the braced welded piping system due to the high displacements and accelerations. Two of the eleven braces failed at the highest input excitation, two 1. 27 cm diameter vertical hanger rods failed during the unbraced tests and a <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> began to leak during a pushover test. The braced threaded system experienced significant damage at relatively low amplitudes.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (FRP) materials {{have been used}} in the chemical and process industries for several decades, chiefly because of the ability of many FRP materials to resist attack by various chemicals. FRP tanks, pressure vessels and piping have successfully been used to replace expensive equipment formerly made in stainless steel or nickel alloys. Although the laminate theory has been used to establish design formulas for cylindrical and spherical shells, little work has been done to investigate bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections.</b> The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or the codes of other industrialized countries do not include specific rules for the design of FRP bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections.</b> Up to now, the only work done on fiber {{reinforced plastic}} flanges has either been experimental investigations, or finite element analyses. No attempt has been made on a stress analysis of bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections</b> based on the laminate theory. Thus the current design practice is merely an extension of metallic flange design methods. In this dissertation, two methods are proposed for a stress analysis of fiber reinforced plastic <b>flanged</b> <b>connections</b> with full face gaskets, using classical and shear deformation laminate theory, respectively. A sample calculation using the first proposed method is included. In order to verify the analytical results, a finite element analysis with 3 -D anisotropic layered solid elements, using ANSYS is performed. Finally, an experimental investigation into the effects of outside to inside diameter ratios on the flange stress distribution and maximum stress values is conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the time-correlated leakage {{model and}} fuzzy random {{probability}} theory, {{a formula for}} calculating fuzzy random reliability of sealing performance of bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections</b> was derived. The optimization variables were defined according to the sensitivity analysis of design parameters on fuzzy reliability of sealing performance. A fuzzy reliability optimization design method of flange was investigated, in which both the tightness of bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections</b> {{and the strength of}} flange were taken into consideration. As an example, an integral welding necked pipe flange was designed according to the optimization design method proposed in this paper. The designed flange not only satisfies the requirements of flange strength and sealing reliability of connections, but also its weight is reduced by 16 % compared with that prescribed in the standard...|$|R

40|$|The three {{critical}} components within a bolted, <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> are the flanges, gasket, and bolts. Until recently, simplified flange assembly target torque values for ASME B 16. 5 flanges were routinely determined by considering {{just one or}} two of these primary components. One approach considers only the gasket. Gasket-based target torque values are selected to optimize the gasket’s sealing performance by ensuring compression between minimum and maximum seating stress ranges, or based upon achieving specific levels of gasket Tightness (Tp).

The contract specifies that FDNW perform an interim (5 year) integrity assessment of the facility and prepare a written IAR in accordance with Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303 - 640. The WAC 173 - 303 defines a treatment, storage, or disposal (TSD) facility tank system as the ``dangerous waste storage or treatment tank and its ancillary equipment and containment. `` This integrity assessment evaluates the two tank systems at the facility: the evaporator vessel, C-A- 1 (also called the vapor-liquid separator), and the condensate collection tank, TK-C- 100. This IAR evaluates the 242 -A facility tank systems up to, but not including, the last valve or <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> inside the facility perimeter. The initial integrity assessment performed on the facility evaluated certain subsystems not directly in contact with dangerous waste, such as the steam condensate and used raw water subsystems, to provide technical information. These subsystems were not evaluated in this IAR. The last major upgrade to the facility was project B- 534. The facility modifications, {{as a result of}} project B- 534, were evaluated in the 1993 facility interim integrity assessment. Since that time, the following upgrades have occurred in the facility: installation of a process condensate recycle system, and installation of a package steam boiler to provide steam for the facility.

The research identifies the capacity {{characteristics of a}} hospital piping system with and without bracings {{as well as the}} system’s weak points. The system was tested to the ICBO AC 156 acceptance criteria for nonstructural components. The input motion of 1 g was amplified to almost 2. 6 g {{at the top of the}} braced and unbraced piping systems. There was no significant damage to the piping system due to the high displacements and accelerations. Two of the eleven braces failed at the highest input excitation, the 2 ” diameter vertical hanger rods failed during the unbraced tests, and a <b>flanged</b> <b>connection</b> began to leak during a pushover test. Preliminary results show that the braces limited the displacements, but they did not significantly reduce the accelerations of the system. Background The functioning of an essential facility, such as a hospital, after an earthquake relies heavily on proper functioning of its nonstructural components such as fire suppression and water distribution systems, elevators and medical equipment. In recent earthquakes, nonstructural components in hospitals and medical buildings have suffered a large amount of damage, which resulted in a significant reduction of the functionality of the facilities. The 1971 San Fernando Earthquake caused severe damage to many hospitals and medical facilities. As a result of that damage, four of the 11 damaged medical facilities in the area had to be evacuated (Wasilewski 1998). Due to this unacceptable performance, the State of California passed the Hospital Seismic Safety Act, which required that medical facilities be designed and built to remain operational after an earthquake event (Ayres and Phillips, 1998). The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) was charged with certifying that bracing components installed in California hospitals met a certain level of strength...|$|E

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} done in {{collaboration}} with Aker Solutions Subsea AS and proposes how one could securely cope with uncontrolled drift-off where the marine riser experience excessive moments and/or tension that will damage the well integrity and structure while the well is undergoing workover or intervention. This weak link design is meant to release the riser from the well structure before damage occurs, either when excessive moments, tension or both {{have the potential to}} damage the structure. The release mechanism should work as a 3 rd barrier, and by itself, with no input from the operator, make the riser disconnect safely. The mechanism should also secure the well so that the surface vessel can safely drift-off from position. The preliminary study project, which was finished in December 2010, produced several interesting concepts. One was chosen for further study and analysis in the master thesis by the candidate, Aker Solutions representatives and the supervisor from NTNU. In this thesis, the concept has been further developed, analyzed and dimensioned to cope with relevant example and extreme loading conditions provided by Aker Solutions Subsea AS. The concept developed in this thesis is based on an idea of a standard ANSI <b>flanged</b> <b>connection.</b> By using pressurized CO 2, the flange geometry produces a separation pressure which forces the flange bolts to break, thus separating the riser connection and disrupting the communication between the surface vessel and the subsea equipment. The system is initiated by a battery powered offset monitoring system which measures the riser offset at a position 55 meters above the EDP. When the separation has been initiated, the hydraulic pressure and control signal connection between the operator and the subsea well is terminated, thus closing the wellbore by utilization of the failsafe valves in the subsea tree and/or well control package. Analyses of the final concept in Abaqus show that the dimensions and geometry copes well with the applied loading condition. The weak link bolts are designed to break if subjected to a limited tension force. This enables the present weak link to be applied as a replacement for existing links which are solely based on tension response. </p...|$|E

40|$|Pressure vessel towers {{used in the}} {{petrochemical}} {{and chemical}} industry are designed to accommodate numbers of internals including trays and beds resulting in tall vertical structures. Transportation of tall towers from the fabrication shop to the construction site presents challenges that can result in high transportation costs or a logistically impossible task of moving the vessel. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the tower for transport by cutting part of the tower skirt and welding it in the field. Depending on the location, welding on site can be expensive, labour intensive and may cause problems {{in the quality of}} the weld and the tower being out of level. Using a <b>flanged</b> skirt <b>connection</b> will reduce the field labour spent on connecting the bottom part of the skirt {{to the rest of the}} vessel.

40|$|Two fused {{chloride}} salt eutectics, binary LiCl-KCl and ternary NaCl- KCl- MgCl/sub 2 /, {{were used}} in fuel processing studies {{as part of the}} Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor research and development program. Results of engineering work done at Brookhaven since 1950 are summarized. It was demonstrated that fused chloride salt technology is sufficiently developed so that loops and other experimental equipment can be designed and operated at 500 deg C {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The equipment, which was operated for many hours, included a large forced-circulation loop and many thermal-convection loops and tanks. The specifications used for the fabrication, cleaning, and testing of equipment for salt service are described. All welded systems, welded by the usual inert-arc procedures, are preferred, but ring type joint stainless-steel <b>flanged</b> <b>connections</b> were found satisfactory, mainly for connecting melt tanks to experimental equipment and for mounting orifice flowmeters. The surfaces of equipment to be used with fused salts were cleaned satisfactorily prior to assembly by several different methods, but sandblasting was found applicable to all types of equipment. Radiography was used to check all welds in contact with fused salt for flaws and, during operation, to locate and determine the cause of any malfunction. Components tested at the normal operating temperature of 500 deg C included pumps, valves, agitators, sightports, samplers, and filtens. Salt samples were usually taken by the thief method. Both stationary and movable resistance type, liquid-level probes were used and were reliable so long as the salt surface remained quiescent; otherwise, splashing and short-circuiting occurred. Nullmatic, pilot-operated pressure transmitters gave good service in conjunction with both orifice and Venturi flowmeters. A procedure is described for preparing pound quantities of pure eutectics, which, in the case of the ternary eutectic, differs from that used in preparing gram quantities. Both eutectics were pretreated with a Bi- Mg-U solution to remove oxidizing impurities before use in corrosion and processing experiments. The results of physical property measurements on the two eutectics are included. (auth...|$|R
30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>connections.</b> Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|R
5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or <b>flanged</b> process <b>connection.</b> The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a flanged pipe joint subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to <b>flanged</b> pipe joint <b>connection,</b> so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed. In addition, results are compared with the conventional analysis. To carry out the investigation, a flanged pipe joint subjected to bending has been modeled using finite element method, which also includes contact simulation. In this analysis, shell element has been used for the modeling of pipe and flange. Non-linear spring has been used to model contact surface and bolt. Non-linear finite element method has been used to find out results till failure by yielding of pipe.
