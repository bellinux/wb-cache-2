25|$|However, elsewhere, {{as in the}} United States, fictitious {{telephone}} numbers are often used in films and on television to avoid disturbances by calls from viewers. For example, The United States 555 (KLondike-5) exchange code was never assigned (with limited exceptions such as 555-1212 for <b>directory</b> <b>assistance).</b> Therefore, American films and TV shows have used 555-xxxx numbers, {{in order to prevent}} a number used in such a work from being called.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} and recognition received by [...] "Cog" [...] led {{a number of}} other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the design space. The first of these was Just Works, a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. Just Works was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, whose previous work included spots for BT Cellnet, Heinz, and Guinness, and the Oscar-nominated short film Holiday Romance. Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under BACC guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second Just Works spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. Just Works went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Club.|$|E

40|$|In the West Bank {{neighborhood}} of Minneapolis, nonprofit organizations successfully access {{the higher education}} resources in the neighborhood. Nonprofits use service learners, volunteers and interns from the University of Minnesota and Augsburg College to expand their workforce and increase their capacity. The small business community on the West Bank has yet to fully tap into the higher education resource pool available. The West Bank Business Association’s “Intern Link” is a student intern position that can help businesses develop projects to meet their marketing, web or business consulting needs by connecting businesses to local higher education resources. These projects will also be rich, real-world learning opportunities for students. When the Intern Link connects business projects to higher education offices, both businesses and students benefit, and the West Bank’s economic development is sparked as a result. This report includes background and tools for carrying out the Intern Link program. It is formatted as a users’ manual to support the West Bank Business Association in its recruitment, orientation and supervision of the Intern Link position. At the time of writing in May of 2011, the WBBA Executive Director and the CHANCE Coordinator are securing funding for the Intern Link position and are implementing a recruitment plan with the expectation of filling the position {{by the fall of}} 2011. The Manual also provides tools for the Intern Link to use in implementing the program.

2500|$|The use {{of numbers}} {{starting}} in 555- (KLondike-5) to represent fictional numbers in U.S. movies, television, and literature originated in this period. [...] The [...] "555" [...] prefix {{was reserved for}} telephone company use and was only consistently used for <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> (information), being [...] "555-1212" [...] for the local area. [...] An attempt to dial a 555 number from a movie {{in the real world}} will always result in an error message when dialed from a phone in the United States. [...] This reduces the likelihood of nuisance calls. [...] Also, QUincy(5-5555) was used, because there was no Q available.|$|E

The Government of Ontario enacted the Fair Access to Regulated Professions Act, 2006 to help immigrants qualify for 34 provincially regulated professions.
