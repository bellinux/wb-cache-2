40|$|Sockets for myoelectric {{prostheses}} {{have not}} changed significantly over the past 30 years. The Otto Bock Muenster style socket (MyoBock) {{was developed in the}} late 1960 ’s by Fruzinsky based on the original Muenster design of Hepp and Kuhn 3. This socket was designed to compliment the newly available myoelectric components of the time that allowed for self-contained, self-suspending transradial prostheses. The Northwestern University socket was first introduced by Billock 1 in 1972. Elements of these two socket designs represent the critical design elements of state-of-the-art transradial interface designs even today. <b>Flexible</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> have helped to improve the dynamics of these socket systems, however, the socket design did not change significantly {{as a result of the}} more flexible materials.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of two <b>flexible</b> <b>thermoplastics,</b> Nylon- 6 (Ny) and bisphenol-A polysulfone (PSu), and two wholly aromatic liquid crystalline polymers, Vectra-A 900 (VA) and Vectra-B 950 (VB), {{as well as}} that of Ny/VB and PSu/VA blends with 10 % LCP, has been investigated by the use of capillary viscometers equipped with cylindrical dies having different length-to-diameter ratios. The elongational viscosity of all materials was calculated, from the results of isothermal measurements carried out at 290 degrees C, by means of the Cogswell's analysis, based on the estimation of the pressure drop due to the converging flow at the die inlet. The behavior in elongational flow was compared with the {{rheological behavior}} in shear flow conditions. It was found that the elongational viscosities of VA and VB are very large and account for a fairly marked pressure drop at the die entrance, due to the orientation of the LCP domains taking place in the converging flow zone. For these materials, the ratio of the elongational viscosity to the Newtonian shear viscosity is up to two orders of magnitude higher than the value expected on the basis of the Trouton rule. For the flexible resins, the Trouton ratio is 3 and ca. 3 - 10, are common values for high molar mass linear polymers. The addition of 10 % LCP into the flexible resins strongly increases their elongational viscosity and makes the blends resemble neat LCPs in their extensional flow behavior. In shear flow, on the contrary, the addition of LCP was shown to induce a marked reduction of the melt viscosity, even when, as for the Ny/VB blend, the LCP is more viscous than the matrix...|$|R
40|$|Stretchable and {{flexible}} conductive polymers have aroused great interest recently {{because of their}} applications {{in the fields of}} novel electronics, such as smart textiles, artificial electronic skin, flexible electronic displays, etc. In this work, stretchable and <b>flexible</b> conductive <b>thermoplastic</b> polyurethane (TPU) /graphene composite foams have been developed by water vapour induced phase separation. The as-prepared TPU/graphene composite foams exhibited a lower modulus, larger elongation at break, and lower hysteresis during a cycle tensile test than a TPU/graphene composite did. It is expected that the improved elasticity of the TPU/graphene composite foams was caused by the deformation of cells, which partially offset the deformation of the TPU matrix. In addition, the cell walls divided the whole composites into many small parts, which could further restrain plastic deformation of hard segment domains under deformation...|$|R

30|$|Among {{the variety}} of {{polymers}} produced, 4 -hydroxybutyrate (4 HB) homopolymer or its copolymer are of interest for various biomedical applications (Martin and Williams 2003). It is a strong, <b>flexible</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> material that can be processed easily to form scaffolds, heart valves, or cardiovascular tissue supports (Martin and Williams 2003). In addition, 4 HB polymer is extremely well tolerated in vivo because biological hydrolysis of 4 HB homopolymer or copolymer yields 4 HB, which is a common metabolite {{in the human body}} (Nelson et al. 1981). A copolymer of 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB) and 4 HB units is degradable by lipase and PHA depolymerase, in contrast to most PHAs, which cannot be degraded by lipase (Saito and Doi 1994; Wu et al. 2009). Aside from 4 HB, the presence of structurally similar monomer units such as 5 -hydroxyvalerate (5 HV) and 6 -hydroxyhexanoate (6 HHx) in PHAs also adds elasticity to the polymer and enhances lipase-mediated degradation of the polymer (Mukai et al. 1993).|$|E

It is especially important for refrigerated and shelf-stable foods where oxygen deteriorates the quality of packaged products and reduces their shelf life. EVOH accounts for a majority of thermoplastic barrier materials used for rigid or semi-rigid retortable food containers. However. it is of limited use in flexible packages or lid films for rigid trays used for packaging thermally processed shelf-stable low acid foods due to its moisture sensitivity. Nevertheless, current use of other oxygen barrier materials such as polyvinylidene chloride and aluminum foil creates environmental concerns.

40|$|Recent advancements in 3 D {{printing}} technology {{have provided a}} potential low-cost and time-saving alternative to conventional PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) -based microfabrication for microfluidic systems. In addition to reducing {{the complexity of the}} fabrication procedure by eliminating such intermediate steps as molding and bonding, 3 D printing also offers more flexibility in terms of structural design than the PDMS micromolding process. At present, 3 D-printed microfluidic systems typically utilize a relatively ‘stiff’ printing material such as ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers), which limits the implementation of large mechanical actuation for active pumping and mixing as routinely carried out in a PDMS system. In this paper, we report the development of an active 3 D-printed microfluidic system with moving parts fabricated from a <b>flexible</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> elastomer (TPE). The 3 D-printed microfluidic system consists of two pneumatically actuated micropumps and one micromixer. The completed system was successfully applied to the detection of low-level insulin concentration using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and the test result compares favorably with a similarly designed PDMS microfluidic system. Prior to system fabrication and testing, the material properties of TPE were extensively evaluated. The result indicated that TPE is compatible with biological materials and its 3 D-printed surface is hydrophilic as opposed to hydrophobic for a molded PDMS surface.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a simple technique for the fabrication of a gold microelectrode array with an integrated Ag/AgCl reference microelectrode based on polyimide (PI) {{which is a}} <b>flexible</b> and biocompatible <b>thermoplastic</b> substrate. The investigated fabrication technology was based on soft lithography which involved a combination of replica molding (RM) and patterning of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), through microcontact printing (μCP). From a fabricated silicon microelectrode mold, an elastomeric stamp of the microelectrodes was replicated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and inked with octadecanethiol (ODT) for patterning of the gold surface. The non-patterned gold was then removed by selective chemical etching leaving very well defined gold microelectrodes with a high resolution. Finally, the integrated Ag/AgCl reference microelectrode was fabricated by silver electro-deposition onto the gold microelectrode. The developed biosensor was then tested for a medical application by immobilizing both monoclonal antibodies (mAb); anti-human interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and anti-human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) onto different working electrodes. Functionalization of the gold microelectrodes was made with carboxyl diazonium through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The multiple detection of the corresponding cytokines was verified by fluorescence, whilst electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis quantified a detectable IL- 10 cytokine concentration from 1 to 15 pg/mL. This confirmed the biorecognition between the anti-human mAb (IL- 10 and TNF-α) and of its corresponding cytokine. The obtained {{results show that the}} mAb's were efficiently immobilized and the proteins for human IL- 10 were detectable at weak concentrations. The electrochemical measurements were applied on the manufactured gold microelectrodes for ∼ 9 h. This shows a high resistance of the microelectrodes for long-lasting measurements and, therefore, highlights the good adhesion of gold-PI.
