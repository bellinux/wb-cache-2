5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley <b>experiment</b> (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the <b>experiment</b> should have given a positive result. However, the result of this <b>experiment</b> was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau <b>experiment</b> and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley <b>experiment</b> of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E

Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE <b>experiment</b> at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia.

This <b>experiment</b> showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted.
