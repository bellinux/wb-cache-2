5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using <b>gelatine</b> {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of <b>gelatine,</b> subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a military man, they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his <b>gelatine</b> covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a <b>gelatine</b> and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

25|$|In 1852, Talbot {{discovered}} that <b>gelatine</b> treated with potassium dichromate, a sensitiser introduced by Mungo Ponton in 1839, is made less soluble {{by exposure to}} light. This later {{provided the basis for}} the important carbon printing process and related technologies. Dichromated <b>gelatine</b> is still used for some laser holography.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century <b>gelatine</b> and {{isinglass}} {{production was}} well established at a site on West Street, production continued until ceasing in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Many experimenters {{tried to}} {{immobilize}} the electrolyte of an electrochemical cell {{to make it}} more convenient to use. The Zamboni pile of 1812 was a high-voltage dry battery but capable of delivering only minute currents. Various experiments were made with cellulose, sawdust, spun glass, asbestos fibers, and <b>gelatine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{attended}} the South London private school Dulwich College (1939–44), and while a pupil {{there was an}} avid comic collector and cartoonist. He produced a comic, The Junior, using heated <b>gelatine</b> and hectograph ink, which he sold for 1d around the school, but had published comics art {{by the time he}} was 14 (1942).|$|E
25|$|Modern {{preparation}} of a simple, light-sensitive surface involves forming an emulsion of silver halide crystals in a <b>gelatine,</b> {{which is then}} coated onto a film or other support. The crystals are formed by precipitation in a controlled environment to produce small, uniform crystals (typically < 1 μm in diameter and containing ~1012 Ag atoms) called grains.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{donkey meat}} is {{considered}} a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and Guo Li Zhuang restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. Donkey-hide gelatin is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product. Ejiao, the <b>gelatine</b> produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilo, at October 2017 prices.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Danish {{scientist}} Peter Boysen-Jensen {{demonstrated that}} the signal was not transfixed but mobile. He separated the tip from {{the remainder of the}} coleoptile by a cube of <b>gelatine</b> which prevented cellular contact, but allowed chemicals to pass through. The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{concern is}} the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, <b>gelatine,</b> or stearates. There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects. Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines, food additives, cosmetics, household products, workplace chemicals, and many other substances.|$|E
25|$|This way of {{evaluation}} deals with agar-agar or <b>gelatine</b> containing semi-solid layers made {{prior to the}} experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut {{at the start of}} the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the early}} {{industries}} to establish itself in Johnstown was the Knox <b>gelatine</b> plant. It was built in 1890 by Charles B. Knox, a prominent Johnstown resident, who developed the granulated, unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation today. When Knox died in 1908, his wife Rose Knox assumed management of the business. She {{became one of the}} earliest successful American businesswomen. The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city. Results of their philanthropy can still be found there today. They gave the city the block of land known as Knox Field, where the playgrounds, athletic fields, and bridle path are located. Knox Junior High School was named in honor of the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the Lipton Tea Company.|$|E
500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling <b>gelatine</b> mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and <b>gelatine</b> were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E
500|$|The {{project would}} soon head off in more {{productive}} directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, {{for which he}} departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a [...] "chronophotographic gun"—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon {{his return to the}} United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on <b>gelatine</b> frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device {{is often referred to as}} an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily [...] "freeze" [...] the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{recorded}} recipe named [...] "pavlova" [...] {{was published in}} the fifth Australian edition of Davis Dainty Dishes in 1926. However this [...] "pavlova" [...] recipe was not meringue based, but was instead a multi-coloured <b>gelatine</b> dish.|$|E
2500|$|Gelatin or <b>gelatine</b> (from [...] meaning [...] "stiff", [...] "frozen") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food {{derived from}} {{collagen}} obtained from various animal body parts. It {{is commonly used}} as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, vitamin capsules, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the Shroud may have been formed using a bas-relief sculpture. Researcher Jacques di Costanzo, noting that the Shroud image {{seems to have a}} three-dimensional quality, suggested that perhaps the image was formed using a three-dimensional object, such as a sculpture. While wrapping a cloth around a life-sized statue would result in a distorted image, placing a cloth over a bas-relief would result in an image like the one seen on the shroud. To demonstrate the plausibility of his hypothesis, Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over the bas-relief. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of ferric oxide and <b>gelatine.</b> The result was an image {{similar to that of the}} Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of [...] and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the <b>gelatine,</b> would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide. Similar results have been obtained by Nickell.|$|E
2500|$|Zefir ( [...] {{may also}} be spelled zephyr or zephir) {{is a type of}} soft {{confectionery}} made by whipping fruit and berry purée (mostly apple puree) with sugar and egg whites with subsequent addition of a gelling agent like pectin, carrageenan, agar, or <b>gelatine.</b> It is commonly produced and sold in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The name given after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes its delicate airy consistency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880 the Low Level Shaft was {{extended}} to the Lucy Tongue Level. The company employed an outside contractor to do this work. Warsop and Hill used their own rock drills and the more powerful blasting <b>gelatine.</b> Impressed by this technology, the company installed an air compressor in 1884 and bought {{a number of the}} rock drills from the contractors. These contractors also drove the crosscut which was needed to connect the bottom of the shaft to the Lucy Tongue Level. This crosscut, [...] long, was known as Warsop's Crosscut ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{sauce is}} made to [...] "take" [...] in many ways: with raw egg yolks, with <b>gelatine,</b> with veal or veal brain glaze. The most common method {{is to take a}} raw egg yolk in a small terrine, with a little salt and lemon juice: take a wooden spoon, turn it while letting a trickle of oil fall and {{stirring}} constantly; as your sauce thickens, add a little vinegar; put in too a pound of good oil: serve your sauce with good salt: serve it white or green, adding green of ravigote or green of spinach.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic plates preceded {{photographic}} {{film as a}} means of photography. A light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied to a glass plate. This form of photographic material largely faded from the consumer market {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were introduced. The wet collodion process was replaced by dry plates at the start of the 1870s. The mechanical production of dry photographic plates were invented by George Eastman who filed U.S. patent #226,503 on September 9, 1879, for (in his own words [...] "An Improved Process for Preparing <b>Gelatine</b> Dry-Film Plates") which was issued to him on April 13, 1880.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade Smith's Shaft was sunk to the 40Fathom Level, the 60Fathom Level, and in 1899 to the 75Fathom Level. In 1896 it was fitted with cages and an {{electric}} winding engine, and the old Lucy Engine Shaft was abandoned in 1899. By 1902 all ore production from above the Lucy Level had ceased. In 1904 Smith's Shaft was extended to the 90Fathom Level which became the major working level for many years. A small patch of ore above {{the north end of}} the Lucy Tongue Level was opened up in the 1890s, known as the Alma Workings. [...] Gelignite was introduced in the 1890s, replacing both blasting <b>gelatine</b> and gunpowder. The first carbide lamps were introduced at Greenside from 1909 onwards; before then all work had been done by candlelight.|$|E
2500|$|The No. 73 grenade had {{a roughly}} {{cylindrical}} shape and plastic screw-on cap, {{similar to that}} of a Thermos flask, from which the 'Thermos bomb' nickname was derived. It was approximately [...] in diameter and [...] in length, and weighed [...] Its explosive content consisted of [...] of polar ammonal <b>gelatine</b> dynamite or nitrogelatine – both of which were easily flammable and could be detonated by the impact of small-arms fire. When thrown at a tank or other vehicle, a weighted tape held in the users hand unravelled and pulled free a safety pin, which was attached to a Type 247 [...] "All-ways" [...] fuze (the same type used in the Gammon bomb and No 69 grenade); this armed and then detonated the grenade. Its weight meant that it could only be thrown short distances, limiting its range to between , and its detonation could injure the user if they did not find cover before it detonated. It was able to penetrate [...] of armour, and [...] "damage severely any light tank." [...] It was best used against the tracks of a tank, which it could easily blow off and force its crew to waste time by stopping and repairing it.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1830 and 1850, more heavy {{industry}} began to locate in Paris. [...] One tenth {{of all the}} steam engines in France {{were made in the}} capital. [...] The industrial enterprises were usually located in the outer parts of the city, where there was land and access to the rivers or canals needed to move heavy goods. [...] The metallurgy industry established itself along the Seine {{in the eastern part of}} the city. [...] The chemical industry was located near La Villette, in the outer part of the city, or at Grenelle. [...] Factories were established to make matches, candles, rubber, ink, <b>gelatine,</b> glue, and various acids. A thousand workers were employed by the Gouin factory in Batignolles to make steam engines. Fifteen hundred were employed by the Cail factories in Grenelle and Chaillot to make rails and ironwork for bridges. [...] At Levallois-Perret, a young engineer, Gustave Eiffel, started an enterprise to make the frames of iron buildings. [...] The eastern part of the city was subjected to noise, smoke, and the smells of industry. [...] Wealthier Parisians moved to the west end of the city, which was quieter and where the prevailing winds blew the smoke in the other direction. When the wealthy and middle-class people deserted these areas, most of the shops also closed and relocated elsewhere, leaving the outer suburbs of eastern Paris with only factories and housing occupied by the poor.|$|E
2500|$|George Norman Barnard (1819–1902) {{was born}} in Coventry, Connecticut, and as a child moved to upstate New York. After a brief career in hotel management, he opened a {{daguerreotype}} studio in Oswego, New York, becoming nationally known for his portraits. It is not known where Barnard learned his trade. On July 5, 1853, Barnard photographed the conflagration at the Ames flour mills in Oswego, producing {{what may be the}} first American [...] "news" [...] photograph. In 1854 he moved his operation to Syracuse, New York, and began using the wet-plate collodion process. In 1859, Barnard joined Edward Anthony's firm. At the outbreak of war, Barnard was working for Mathew Brady in Washington D.C. and New York City. Barnard, besides doing portraits and photographing the troops around Washington D.C., was among Brady's initial corps of photographers, who were sent into the field to photograph the battlefields of Northern Virginia, and the Peninsula, including Bull Run and Yorktown, as well as Harper's Ferry. Barnard {{is best known for his}} 1866 [...] masterpiece, Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign, which contains 61 Imperial size, albumen prints embracing scenes from the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, the Great March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas. He continued to photograph after the war, operating studios in Charleston, S.C. and Chicago. His Chicago studio was destroyed by the historic fire of 1871. In 1880 Barnard sold his Charleston studio and moved to Rochester, New York. From 1881 to 1883 he was the distinguished spokesman for George Eastman's line <b>gelatine</b> dry plates. Barnard ventured into his own short lived dry plate manufacturing concern with Robert H. Furman in 1862. In 1864, the Barnards moved to Painesville, Ohio and opened a studio which utilized their own manufactured dry plates. In 1888, George closed his business and his family moved to Gadsden, Alabama. In 1892, he moved for the last time to Cedarville, near Syracuse, New York, where he maintained his interest in photography, taking pictures of friends and family, and taking yearly class pictures of the school children. George Barnard died in 1902 at the age of 82.|$|E
60|$|Experiment 7.--A bit of half roasted meat (not measured) {{and a bit}} of <b>gelatine</b> {{were placed}} on the two ends of a leaf, which [page 303] opened spontaneously after eleven days; a vestige of the meat was left, and the surface of the leaf was here blackened; the <b>gelatine</b> had all disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|Gelatine.--I used pure <b>gelatine</b> in thin sheets given [page 111] me by Prof. Hoffmann. For comparison, {{squares of}} the same size as those placed on the leaves were left close by on wet moss. These soon swelled, but {{retained}} their angles for three days; after five days they formed rounded, softened masses, but even on the eighth day a trace of <b>gelatine</b> could still be detected. Other squares were immersed in water, and these, though much swollen, retained their angles for six days. Squares of 1/10 of an inch (2.54 mm.), just moistened with water, were placed on two leaves; and after two or three days nothing was left on them but some acid viscid fluid, which in this and other cases never showed any tendency to regelatinise; so that the secretion must act on the <b>gelatine</b> differently to what water does, and apparently {{in the same manner as}} gastric juice.* Four squares {{of the same}} size as before were then soaked for three days in water, and placed on large leaves; the <b>gelatine</b> was liquefied and rendered acid in two days, but did not excite much inflection. The leaves began to re-expand after four or five days, much viscid fluid being left on their discs, as if but little had been absorbed. One of these leaves, as soon as it re-expanded, caught a small fly, and after 24 hrs. was closely inflected, showing how much more potent than <b>gelatine</b> is the animal matter absorbed from an insect. Some larger pieces of <b>gelatine,</b> soaked for five days in water, were next placed on three leaves, but these did not become much inflected until the third day; nor was the <b>gelatine</b> completely liquefied until the fourth day. On this day one leaf began to re-expand; the second on the fifth; and third on the sixth. These several facts ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that {{inorganic}} and non-nitrogenous objects placed on the leaves do not excite any movement; but nitrogenous bodies, if in the least degree damp, cause after several hours the lobes to close slowly. Thus bits of quite dry meat and <b>gelatine</b> were placed {{at opposite ends of}} the same leaf, {{and in the course of}} 24 hrs. excited neither secretion nor movement. They were then dipped in water, their surfaces dried on blotting paper, and replaced on the same [page 297] leaf, the plant being now covered with a bell-glass. After 24 hrs. the damp meat had excited some acid secretion, and the lobes at this end of the leaf were almost shut. At the other end, where the damp <b>gelatine</b> lay, the leaf was still quite open, nor had any secretion been excited; so that, as with Drosera, <b>gelatine</b> is not nearly so exciting a substance as meat. The secretion beneath the meat was tested by pushing a strip of litmus paper under it (the filaments not being touched), and this slight stimulus caused the leaf to shut. On the eleventh day it reopened; but the end where the <b>gelatine</b> lay, expanded several hours before the opposite end with the meat.|$|E
60|$|Experiment 6.--A cube of albumen of 1/10 of an {{inch and}} a piece of <b>gelatine</b> of the same size as before were placed on a leaf, which opened spontaneously after {{thirteen}} days, The albumen, which was twice as thick as in the latter experiments, was too large; for the glands in contact with it were injured and were dropping off; a film also of albumen of a brown colour, matted with mould, was left. All the <b>gelatine</b> was absorbed, and there was only a little acid secretion left on the midrib.|$|E
6000|$|... "The motion {{through the}} air is indisputably of a very exhilarating description." [...] With that decision, the clergyman turned to give his orders to the attendant, in a firm, {{authoritative}} voice, {{for a cup of}} tea, two <b>gelatine</b> lozenges, bread and butter, salad, and pie to follow. [...] "The <b>gelatine</b> lozenges I must have. I require them to precipitate the tannin in my tea," [...] he remarked to the room at large, and folding his hands, remained for some time with his chin thereon, staring fixedly at a little picture over Mr. Hoopdriver's head.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the last}} chapter it was shown that a {{solution}} of isinglass of commerce, as thick as milk or cream, induces strong inflection. I therefore wished to compare its action with that of pure <b>gelatine.</b> Solutions of one part of both substances to 218 of water were made; and half-minim drops (.0296 ml.) {{were placed on the}} discs of eight leaves, so that each received 1/480 of a grain, or [...] .135 mg. The four with the isinglass were much more strongly inflected than the other four. I conclude therefore that isinglass contains some, though perhaps very little, soluble albuminous matter. As soon as these eight leaves re-expanded, they were given bits of roast meat, and in some hours all became greatly inflected; again showing how much more meat excites Drosera than does <b>gelatine</b> or isinglass. This is an interesting fact, as {{it is well known that}} <b>gelatine</b> by itself has little power of nourishing animals.* ...|$|E
