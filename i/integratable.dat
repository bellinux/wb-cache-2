40|$|Nanophotonic waveguides are the {{building}} blocks of integrated photonics. To date, while quarter-wave plates (QWPs) are widely used as common components {{for a wide range of}} applications in free space, there are almost no reports of <b>Integratable</b> QWPs being able to manipulate the angular momentum (AM) of photons inside nanophotonic waveguides. Here, we demonstrate two kinds of <b>Integratable</b> QWPs respectively based on the concept of abrupt phase change and birefringence effect. The orientation of the equivalent optical axis of an <b>Integratable</b> QWP is designable. Remarkably, a combination of two <b>integratable</b> QWPs with different equivalent optical axes leads to an integrated system that performances one-way AM conversion. Moreover, this system can be used as a point source that can excite different patterns on a metal surface via directional excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). These results allow for the control of AM of light in nanophotonic waveguides, which are crucial for various applications with limited physical space, such as on-chip bio-sensing and integrated quantum information processing...|$|E

40|$|Interference dips in {{electronic}} absorption spectra caused by coupling between excited states are calculated and interpreted using three methods: an analytical expression, an <b>integratable</b> expression, and wave packet propagation. All {{of the analyses}} give similar results. The dips (distantly related to Fano’s antiresonance) are caused by spin-orbit coupling between the states involved in spin-forbidden transitions with narrow bandwidths and the state involved in a spin-allowed transition with a large bandwidth caused by progressions in normal vibrational modes that are displaced between the excited and ground electronic states. The analytical expression involves the assumptions that only one vibrational eigenstate of the “forbidden ” electronic state is involved and that the broad background is represented by a Lorentzian-type function. The <b>integratable</b> expression replaces the Lorentzian function by one that represents the band shape caused by a progression of unresolved vibronic peaks. The wave packet propagation method is exact for the model. Analytical expressions for multiple interfering states and <b>integratable</b> expressions for multiple electronic states and multiple vibrational modes are derived. The spectra of Ni(H 2 O) 62 + and octahedral CrO 69 - units in ZrO 2 â 33 %Y 2 O 3 doped with chromium(III) are analyzed.
