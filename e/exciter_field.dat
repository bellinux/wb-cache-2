5000|$|An [...] "overvoltage clamping" [...] bulk {{semiconductor}} {{similar to}} an MOV, {{though it does}} not clamp as well. However, it usually has a longer life than an MOV. It is used mostly in high-energy DC circuits, like the <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> of an alternator. It can dissipate power continuously, and it retains its clamping characteristics throughout the surge event, if properly sized.|$|E
50|$|Varying {{the amount}} of current through the {{stationary}} <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly, mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output. The result {{of all this is}} that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator.|$|E
50|$|The {{main exciter}} is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} coupled {{to the main}} generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
40|$|The sizing {{procedures}} adopted for {{the everyday}} design of electrical machines {{are well known}} and consolidated. However, for brushless <b>exciters</b> of <b>field</b> wound, synchronous generators, there is significant room for improvement as {{the impact of the}} diodes’ commutations in the rotating bridge rectifier are often neglected. This paper deals with the development of a fast analytical, genetic-algorithm-based design tool for the excitation systems of salient-pole, field wound synchronous generators. As vessel for this study, the exciter of a particular 400 kVAis considered. The proposed tool is focused on achieving exciter designs that minimize the voltage drop due to the commutation processes in the rotating diode rectifier, with minimum impact on the overall efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{performance}} improvement of synchronous generator using <b>exciter</b> control with <b>field</b> coils parameter estimation technique. In general, the generator excitation system controller uses the PID controller. When the Field winding impedance changed, the PID gains must be changed. General method {{is difficult to}} apply varying capacity of the synchronous generator. The proposed control method determine automatically measure the internal impedance of the synchronous generator‘s exciter and configure the controller. This method can be applied regardless of the generator capacity. So {{it is possible to}} apply a variety of synchronous generator systems. The validity of the propose...|$|R
50|$|A {{brushless}} alternator {{is composed}} of two alternators built end-to-end on one shaft. Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions. The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter. The <b>exciter</b> has stationary <b>field</b> coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A bridge rectifier, called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary armature (power generation windings).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 An {{algorithm}} for computing the parameter sensitivities of an {{excitation system}} for a hydroelectric generation system is developed for model analysis in this thesis. The IEEE Type 1 excitation system representation, linked with a simplified alternator and voltage regulator equivalent, provide a closed-loop model for digital simulation. Parametric sensitivities are derived from computations upon the transient <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltage response caused by a perturbation of the regulator reference voltage. The digital-analog simulator language, MIMIC, was utilized to implement the model. <b>Exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltage responses from models differing by variations in one parameter are converted to sensitivities by a FORTRAN program. Sensitivities, <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltages and system parameters are listed as output data. A line printer plotting routine provides several types of graphic representation for the sensitivity responses. A broad range of model specifications was executed {{to demonstrate the utility}} of these programs. Observations directly from the sensitivity results revealed the effects of parameter derivations upon the system's response. Program flexibility, providing the user {{with a wide range of}} options in both model specification and information output, received major emphasis throughout this study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{excitation}} system {{is an important}} component element that influences the dynamic behavior of alternators. However, when the two-quadrant H-half bridge converter is used in the <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> current closed-loop control system, there will be some problems of nonlinearity. To prevent the converter from working in the nonlinear area, the working conditions of linear and nonlinear area of H-half bridge converter is discussed firstly in this paper. And then it is verified by the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The main {{role of the}} {{permanent}} magnet machine in the aviation frequency alternator is as the exciter. Its main function {{is not only to}} supply power for the generator controller but also supply the excitation current to <b>exciter</b> by supplying <b>field</b> winding of <b>exciter</b> with DC excitation voltage in the case without the emergency power. So we have to rectify 115 V AC of permanent magnet machine output and make DC/DC conversion, so that the output is the suitable DC voltage. In the actual, it is very troublesome to make parameter tuning to rectifier module and DC/DC module, so this it is necessary to make model and simulation research. In this paper, we make module, simulation and parameter tuning for the rectifier and DC/DC transformation module in the MATLAB environment. From the simulation results, we can get that the model is correct, the parameters are appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators ≥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} static excitation system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available field winding ceiling voltage of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional static excitation systems. However, a ceiling voltage factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque pulsations, low power factor and low utilization of the exciter is the end result. New power electronic interfaces on the shaft results in a betterutilization of the designed exciter and improves the mechanical performance {{as well as the}} controllability of the generator field winding. Permanent magnet rotating <b>exciters</b> increase the <b>field</b> forcing strength of the synchronous generator, yielding improved transient stability (Fault Ride-Through req.). Brushless exciters also reduces regular maintenance of the generator. The thesis includes experiments on a state of the art synchronous generator test setup including constructed PM exciter and different power electronic solutions. Some investigations has been done on industrial power plants as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of direct frequency converters with artificial and natural- switching {{term of the}} cyclical control algorithm is presented; the recommendations for their using in brushless asynchronized machines with three-phase winding are developed. Converters with {{a limited number of}} full-controlled valves have large losses in safety circuits of gates, they can be used in system of automatic excitation control. The best quality of voltage and current load are provided by converters with natural commutation using modulated input voltage, the combined potential compounds windings supply and the combined method of thyristor controlling. When the load is divided into two three-phase groups, an even number of phases of the power supply for single phase of the load are applied the bridge converter circuit. Regulation of the load current is carried out by the excitation current of <b>field</b> <b>exciters</b> and by the control angle of thyristor. Converters can be used in high-power asynchronized motors and generators. In asynchronized compensators it is possible to use diode-thyristor converters without transmitting the control signals to the rotating part. The frequency converters without modulation of input voltage have the smallest increase in rated capacity of power supply. However, they have a low quality form of the output voltage at high power factor of load...|$|R
