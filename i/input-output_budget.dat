40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to assess to which extent organic farming {{practices}} would affect the accumulation of total and available phosphorus (P) in a cropped soil in comparison to conventional practices. In order to achieve this, soil samples were taken from a long-term field trial comparing a non-fertilised control (NON), two conventionally cultivated treatments (MIN, CON), and two organically cultivated treatments (ORG, DYN). Soil samples were taken from each treatment at two depths (0 - 20 and 30 - 50 cm) before starting the field trial (1977) {{and at the end}} of every three crop rotations (1984, 1991 and 1998). They were then analysed for total P (Pt), total inorganic P (Pi), total organic P (Po) and isotopically exchangeable Pi. After 21 years, the average P <b>input-output</b> <b>budget</b> reached - 20. 9 kg P ha− 1 a− 1 for NON, - 7. 8 for DYN, - 5. 7 for ORG, - 5. 0 for MIN and + 3. 8 for CON. Total P, Pi as well as the amount of Pi isotopically exchangeable within 1 minute (E 1) were positively correlated to the P budget. Comparison between P budget and Pt in the top- and subsoils of the fertilised treatments suggested a net transfer of P from the 0 – 20 to the 30 – 50 cm layers between 13 and 26 kg P ha− 1 a− 1 during the first rotation and between 3 and 12 kg P ha− 1 a− 1 during the second rotation. During the third rotation a net upward movement of P from the subsurface to the topsoil ranging between 3. 7 and 10. 5 kg P ha− 1 a− 1 was estimated. In the topsoil, E 1 decreased from an initial value of 12 mg P kg− 1 to 11 in CON, 8 in MIN, 6 in ORG, 5 in DYN and 2 in NON after 21 years. In the subsoil, E 1 increased from an initial value of 2 mg P kg− 1 to 4 in MIN, ORG, DYN and NON and to 6 in CON. These results show that, with the exception of NON, all treatments had still an adequate level of available P after 21 years of trial and that, in this low to moderately P sorbing soil, an equilibrated <b>input-output</b> <b>budget</b> allows to maintain P availability at a constant level. In the organic systems, yields have so far partly been attained at the expense of soil reserves or residual P from earlier fertiliser applications...|$|E

Current atmospheric N deposition was 18 kg ha– 1 year– 1. Nitrogen fluxes in throughfall varied from 17 to 23 kg ha– 1 year– 1 with an increasing trend with stand age. The total N fluxes ranged from 7. 3 to 9. 3 kg ha– 1 year– 1 under the forest floor and from 1. 2 to 2. 5 kg ha– 1 year– 1 at 30 -cm soil depth with the high values in the older stand. The net mineralization potentials in the old stands ranged from 19 to 24 mg kg– 1 month– 1, and were 30 – 55 % higher {{than those in the}} young stands. The inorganic N concentration and flux at 30 -cm soil depth were significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with net mineralization potential.

From Feb, 2009 to Jan, 2010, researchers evaluated base cation <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> and identified the most important input and output pathways of base cations under three urea management levels. The balances of base cations showed net surpluses of 5. 2 - 34. 1 kmol 1 / 2 Ca 2 +, 25. 2 - 30. 0 kmol 1 / 2 Mg 2 +, 12. 0 - 15. 9 kmol K + and 22. 1 - 25. 1 kmol Na + /ha/year under different Nitrogen (N) levels. Different N levels did not produce significantly different effects on the budgets of base cations. The major contributor to Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Na + surpluses was irrigation water whereas the main contributor to K + surplus was the overuse of potassium (K) fertilizer. Chicken manure also was an important contributor to Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K + surpluses but not to Na + surplus.

Wet and dry deposition inputs were determined {{on a weekly basis}} from data collected at atmospheric deposition monitoring stations located near the study sites. Stream export was estimated from intensively sampled stream chemistry and continuous discharge data collected on all five basins. On four of the five basins, deposited sulfur was essentially in balance with stream flow export of sulfur (92 – 120 % exported) for the 1989 water year. The fifth basin had net retention of deposited sulfur, with only 42 % exported. All five basins retained the vast majority of deposited nitrogen (only 3 – 18 % exported). The fraction of atmospherically deposited sulfur exported in stream flow was greater by a mean factor of 14 versus nitrogen, implying that sulfur dominates base cation leaching processes on these non-carbonate-based catchments.

Measure-ments of PCB and PAH concentrations {{have been made in}} rain, air, water, dated sediment cores, and sediment trap samples over a 2 -yr study period and used to determine fluxes to and from the lake. A steady state mass balance model was used to construct an <b>input–output</b> <b>budget</b> for the chemicals and to investigate the relative importance of transport {{into and out of the}} lake. The hydraulic transport from the lake was the most important loss mechanism for both PCBs and PAHs. Volatilization, not sedimentation, is currently the dominant loss process for PCBs in the water column, whereas, sedimentation exceeds volatilization for PAHs. The data further suggest that the current sediment–water flux is upward for PCBs and downwards for PAHs, indicating that the sediments might be acting as a secondary source for PCBs but continue to act as a sink for PAHs. Riverine, catchment runoff, or both are believed to be the most important input for PCBs and PAHs to the lake although direct aerial deposition to the lake is also important for PCBs. Differences in the mixtures of compounds in the various compartments suggests sig-nificant fractionation of PCBs and PAHs in the air–water–sediment system in the lake.

According to the calculated P <b>input–output</b> <b>budget,</b> 9 – 14 of the 20 kg P/ha added as superphosphate annually remained in the system, depending on the treatment. The measured increase in total P in 0 – 0. 20 m did not differ between treatments, showing an accumulation rate of only 9 ± 2 kg P/ha. year. These results suggest a loss of 4 ± 2 kg P/ha. year, presumably into lower soil layers. Resin-extractable P at 0 – 0. 10 m increased by 1. 7 kg P/ha. year, irrespective of the treatment. The increase in total P after 24 years was almost completely accounted for by the increase in total extractable inorganic P. Changes in organic P paralleled changes in organic carbon, with a significant loss in treatments with stubble burning (wheat–lupin rotation and continuous wheat), and a significant accumulation in a wheat–subterranean clover rotation with stubble retention and direct drilling. We conclude that on the time scale of this experiment, the dynamics of carbon and organic P are closely linked. E. K. Bünemann, D. P. Heenan, P. Marschner and A. M. McNeil...|$|E

The study approach is based on a large number of permanent plots for extensive monitoring (Level 1). At this level, crown condition is assessed annually, and soil condition and the nutritional status of forests surveyed. Some of the permanent plots were selected for intensive monitoring (Level 2), focussing mainly on the impact of atmospheric pollution on forest ecosystems. Level 2 monitoring also includes increment analyses, ground vegetation assessment, atmospheric deposition, soil solution analyses and climatic observations. This paper summarises the main results of a pluriannual research, which provides a general picture of the state of forest health in the region and focuses on more detailed investigations, described as case studies. Modified wet and dry samplers which use a water surface to collect dry deposition were used in a pluriannual field campaign at five sites in alpine and prealpine areas, to measure the total atmospheric depositions and to evaluate the nitrogen and sulphate exceedances of critical loads. Throughfall and bulk precipitation chemistry were studied for five years (June 1994 -May 1999) at two high elevation forest sites (Val Gerola and Val Masino) which were known to differ in terms of tree health, as assessed by live crown condition. Results indicated a higher contribution from the dry deposition of N-NO 3 -, N-NH 4 + and H+ and considerable canopy leaching of Ca 2 +, K+ and weak organic acids at Val Gerola, where the symptoms of damage were more evident. In the area of Val Masino (SO), included since 1997 in the national CONECOFOR network, investigations focused on the effectiveness of the biological compartment in modifying fluxes of atmospheric elements, and on the role of nitrogen both as an acidifying element and as a nutrient.

40|$|Compared to conifers, {{broadleaf}} {{forests are}} {{less prone to}} soil and water acidification, because (1) they often have soils with larger exchangeable base cation pools, (2) the pollution scavenging capacity of deciduous trees is lower, and (3) they grow more slowly and are often less intensively managed. Since the 1980 s, atmospheric deposition acidity has strongly decreased in forest ecosystems, so that the present acidification status of broadleaf forests should be improving. We used a 35 year-old beech plot in the Morvan Mountains (Burgundy, France) to question past and present acidification processes in broadleaf ecosystems. Soil exchangeable Mg, Ca and K pools measured from samples collected in 1974 and 2001 were compared and <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> were computed over the 2003 - 2008 period. The objectives were (i) to assess Mg and Ca pool size changes over 1974 - 2008, (ii) to discuss the potential causes of these changes and, (iii) discuss the limits of conventional methods to study nutrient pool size changes (soil data comparison and nutrient budgets). Soil exchangeable Mg pools decreased during the 1974 - 2001 period while Ca and K pools remained constant, and very small. Soil solution monitoring and <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> over the 2003 - 2008 period suggested an ongoing loss of exchangeable Ca and Mg, {{partly due to the}} desorption of sulphate from the soil which induced Mg, Ca and K depletion. Given the very low concentration in exchangeable base cations, and assuming no change in soil spatial variability, we computed that resampling soils at 10 years intervals may not unequivocally demonstrate a gain/loss of exchangeable base cations. Foliar Mg concentrations were continuously below the deficiency level, K and N concentrations decreased but Ca did not. From this, we discuss the validity/limits of the different approaches used, how the ecosystem can cope with such low levels of nutrients, and the fluxes and processes within the ecosystem that should be investigated in this perspective.

The intrasystem fluxes of uptake, return, canopy leaching and mineralization were simulated over the period of forest aggradation. A forest-dynamics model, based on previous models, was created to model biotically-driven fluxes at this site; biomass nutrient concentrations were parameterized with a field study. A two-year watershed mass-balance study was then conducted to estimate geologic fluxes for comparison with modeled biotic fluxes. Results show the major biotic fluxes to be much greater, highlighting the importance of considering biomass dynamics in ecosystem nutrient-cycling studies. Mineralization from forest-floor biomass compartments proved to be an increasingly important avenue for internal recycling during aggradation.

Bulk precipitation is acidic. Some pollution episodes occur in winter and early spring, but the annual bulk deposition acidity is rather low.

A comparison of elemental <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> and mass accumulation rates (MAR) in bottom sediments shows that most major elements, except Ca, Si, and Mn, have comparable riverine particulate matter fluxes and MARS. The addition of wet atmospheric deposition fluxes results in an excess of Ca, Mg, and Na entering the lake.

Results of throughfall and deposition measurements at 163 plots in Europe show that total deposition of S and N compounds ranged from 100 to 3000 mol ha/yr in approximately 90 % of the plots, but values up to 4000 - 8000 mol ha/yr were also observed. Approximately 50 % of the plots received N inputs, dominated byNH 4, above 1000 mol ha/yr which is a deposition level at which species diversity of the ground vegetation may be at risk.

In the riparian wetland we also measured changes in groundwater N. Groundwater N changed significantly from tension lysimeters {{at the edge}} of the peatland to piezometer nests within the peatland. Mean N concentrations at the peatland perimeter were 1 Ð 5, 0 Ð 5 and 18 Ð 6 µmol L 1 for NH 4 C, NO 3 and DON (dissolved organic nitrogen), respectively, whereas peatland groundwater N concentration was 56 Ð 9, 1 Ð 5 and 31 Ð 6 µmol L 1 for NH 4 C, NO 3 and DON, respectively.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrological}} and biogeochemical {{monitoring of}} catchments {{has become a}} common approach for studying {{the effect of the}} evolution of agricultural practices on water resources. In numerous studies, the catchment is used as a "mega-lysimeter" to calculate annual <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets.</b> However, the literature reflects two opposite interpretations of the trends of nitrate concentration in streamwater. For some authors, essentially in applied studies, the mean residence time of leached nitrate in shallow groundwater systems is much less than one year and river loads reflect annual land use while for others, nitrate is essentially transport limited, independent of soil nitrate supply in the short term and annual variations reflect changes in climatic conditions. This study tests the effect of agricultural land-use changes on inter-annual nitrate trends on stream water of six small adjacent catchments from 0. 10 to 0. 57 km 2 in area, on granite bedrock, at Kerbernez, in Western Brittany (France). Nitrate concentrations and loads in streamwater have been monitored for nine years (1992 to 2000) at the outlet of the catchments. An extensive survey of agricultural practices from 1993 to 1999 allowed assessment of the nitrogen available for leaching through nitrogen budgets. For such small catchments, year-to-year variations of nitrate leaching can be very important, even when considering the ‘memory effect' of soil, while nitrate concentrations in streamwater appear relatively steady. No correlation was found between the calculated mean nitrate concentration of drainage water and the mean annual concentration in streams, which can even exhibit opposite trends in inter-annual variations. The climatic conditions do not affect the mean concentration in streamwater significantly.

The present study sought to quantify the impacts of strip-mining and reclamation on the base cation pools and cycling within a watershed. To that end, a paired watershed study was conducted comparing a strip-mined watershed (TMat 1) to a second-growth forested watershed (TNef 1). Base cation <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> were constructed for two watersheds using precipitation collection and stream sampling techniques. Soil base cation pools and cation exchange capacities were measured, and lysimeter samples were analyzed for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. In-stream silica concentrations were also measured to help discern whether base cation export was due to a silicate mineral weathering source or from the soil exchange complex. Although it was difficult to determine the source of base cations, TMat 1 was exporting vastly greater quantities of all four base cations than was TNef 1. Mineral soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Na were significantly greater at TMat 1, due to mining and exposure of mineral surfaces such as limestone and other bedrock. Mineral soil CEC was not significantly different between the two sites. Similarly, 15 cm deep lysimeters also had significantly higher levels of Ca, Mg, and Na at TMat 1 than TNef 1.

Complementary measurements during 3 years after planting the same Eucalyptus clone in the experimental savanna made it possible to establish <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> of nutrients for the whole rotation and to compare them with the native savanna ecosystem. Even if the nutrient fluxes in the savanna ecosystem were affected by afforestation, the biogeochemical cycles remained highly conservative after planting eucalypts.

Both ecosystems were efficient in preventing losses by deep drainage (< 5 kg ha- 1 year- 1 for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg). After afforestation, weeding in the Eucalyptus stands eliminated the leguminous species responsible for N input by symbiotic fixation of about 20 kg ha- 1 year- 1. Whereas the budgets of P, K, Ca and Mg were roughly balanced, the current silviculture led to a deficit of about 140 kg N ha- 1 in the soil, throughout a 7 -year rotation.

The pools of exchangeable magnesium and calcium are measured by ion-exchange soil extractions. These pools are sustained in the long term by the weathering of primary minerals in the soil and atmospheric inputs. This conceptual model is the base of <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> from which soil acidification and the sustainability of soil chemical fertility is inferred. However, this model has been questioned by data from long-term forest ecosystem monitoring sites, particularly for calcium. Quantifying the contribution of atmospheric inputs, ion exchange and weathering of both primary, secondary and non-crystalline phases to tree nutrition in the short term is challenging. In this study, we developed and applied a novel isotopic dilution technique using the stable isotopes of magnesium and calcium to study the contribution of the different soil phases to soil solution chemistry in a very acidic soil. The labile pools of Mg and Ca in the soil (pools in equilibrium with the soil solution) were isotopically labeled by spraying a solution enriched in 26 Mg and 44 Ca on the soil. Labeled soil columns were then percolated with a dilute acid solution during a 3 -month period and the isotopic dilution of the tracers was monitored in the leaching solution, in the exchangeable (2 sequential 1 mol L− 1 ammonium acetate extractions) and non-crystalline (2 sequential soil digestions: oxalic acid followed by nitric acid) phases. Significant amounts of Mg and Ca isotope tracer were recovered in the non-crystalline soil phases. These phases represented from 5 % to 25 % and from 24 % to 50 %, respectively, of the Mg and Ca labile pools during the experiment. Our results show that non-crystalline phases act as both a source and a sink of calcium and magnesium in the soil, and contribute directly to soil solution chemistry on very short-term time scales. These phases are very abundant in acid soils and, in the present study, represent a substantial calcium pool (equivalent in size to the Ca exchangeable pool). The gradual isotopic dilution of Mg and Ca isotope ratios in the leaching solution during the experiment evidenced an input flux of Mg and Ca originating from a pool other than the labile pool. While the Mg input flux originated primarily from the weathering of primary minerals and secondarily from the non-crystalline phases, the Ca input flux originated primarily from the non-crystalline phases. Our results also show that the net calcium release flux from these phases may represent a significant source of calcium in forest ecosystems and actively contribute to compensating the depletion of Ca exchangeable pools in the soil. Non-crystalline phases therefore should be taken into account when computing <b>input-output</b> nutrient <b>budgets</b> and soil acid neutralizing capacity. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{rates of}} {{nutrient}} losses {{is crucial for}} sustaining the health of tropical forests. Investigations of dissolved and particulate nutrient export from two forested catchments (C 1 and C 2), at Bukit Tarek Experimental Catchment in Selangor, Malaysia revealed low levels of electrical conductivity and solute concentrations that reflect poor site fertility. Concentrations of K +, NO 3 -N and Mg 2 + increased during storms whereas those of SiO 2 and alkalinity decreased. Cumulative plots of monthly solute loadings exhibit three different patterns: (1) larger export during storms of NO 3 -N, K+, Mg 2 + and Cl -; (2) larger export during low flow conditions of SiO 2, PO 43 - and Na+; and (3) fairly equal export during low flow and storms for NH 3 -N and Ca 2 +. Such patterns demonstrate the roles of various flow paths for evacuating solutes. During heavy storms, near surface lateral flow takes up additional solutes from nutrient matter in the organic soil. SiO 2 dominates the solute export in both catchments contributing about 76 % of the total solute load. Compared to reported values for other tropical forest sites of varying fertility, exports of dissolved Ca 2 + and K+ are low whereas Mg 2 + {{is close to the}} average. However, when confined to sites with low soil fertility; the exports of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K+ at Bukit Tarek are similar to the medians of the reported values. Interestingly, export of Mg and Ca in suspended particulate matter (SPM) exceeded the removal of these nutrients in dissolved forms. This highlights the need to re-evaluate results of nutrient <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> derived solely from dissolved loadings, especially when the net gains are small. Sources of stream litter were limited to near channel margins, resulting in very low outputs per unit area. Consequently, the nutrient losses via this mode were negligible compared to the dissolved load. Removal of nutrients in bed load was also small, being less than 1 % of the dissolved loads except for N (2. 1 and 2. 5 % for C 1 and C 2, respectively) and total P (7. 5 and 11 %, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of fast-growing tropical Eucalyptus plantations {{is of concern}} {{in a context of}} rising fertilizer costs, since large amounts of nutrients are removed with biomass every 6 - 7 years from highly weathered soils. A better understanding of the dynamics of tree requirements is required to match fertilization regimes to the availability of each nutrient in the soil. The nutrition of Eucalyptus plantations has been intensively investigated and many studies have focused on specific fluxes in the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients. However, studies dealing with complete cycles are scarce for the Tropics. The objective of this paper was to compare these cycles for Eucalyptus plantations in Congo and Brazil, with contrasting climates, soil properties, and management practices. The main features were similar in the two situations. Most nutrient fluxes were driven by crown establishment the two first years after planting and total biomass production thereafter. These forests were characterized by huge nutrient requirements: 155, 10, 52, 55 and 23 kg ha(- 1) of N, P, K, Ca and Mg the first year after planting at the Brazilian study site, respectively. High growth rates the first months after planting were essential {{to take advantage of the}} large amounts of nutrients released into the soil solutions by organic matter mineralization after harvesting. This study highlighted the predominant role of biological and biochemical cycles over the geochemical cycle of nutrients in tropical Eucalyptus plantations and indicated the prime importance of carefully managing organic matter in these soils. Limited nutrient losses through deep drainage after clear-cutting in the sandy soils of the two study sites showed the remarkable efficiency of Eucalyptus trees in keeping limited nutrient pools within the ecosystem, even after major disturbances. Nutrient <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> suggested that Eucalyptus plantations take advantage of soil fertility inherited from previous land uses and that long-term sustainability will require an increase in the inputs of certain nutrients.

Trend {{analysis was conducted}} on monthly ion concentrations in deposition and runoff when more than 9 years of data were available (14 regions, 17 sites). Annual average SO 4 deposition during the 1990 s ranged between 7. 3 and 28. 4 kg ha(- 1) per year, and inorganic nitrogen (N) deposition was between 2. 8 and 13. 8 kg ha(- 1) per year, of which 41 - 67 % was nitrate (NO 3 -N). Over the period of record, SO 4 concentration in deposition decreased in 13 / 14 (13 out of 14 total) regions and SO 4 in runoff decreased at 14 / 17 catchments. In contrast, NO 3 -N concentrations in deposition decreased in only 1 / 14 regions, while NH 4 -N concentration patterns varied; increasing at 3 / 14 regions and decreasing at 2 / 14 regions. Nitrate concentrations in runoff decreased at 4 / 17 catchments and increased at only 1 site, whereas runoff levels of NH 4 -N increased at 5 / 17 catchments. Decreasing trends in deposition were also recorded for Ca, Mg, and K at many of the catchments and on an equivalent basis, accounted for up to 131 % (median 22 %) of the decrease in acid anion deposition. Base cation concentrations in streams generally declined over time, with significant decreases in Ca, Mg and K occurring at 8, 9 and 7 of 17 sites respectively, which accounted for up to 133 % (median 48 %) of the decrease in acid anion concentration. Sulphate export exceeded input at 18 / 21 catchments, likely due to dry deposition and/or internal sources. The majority of N in deposition (31 - 100 %; median 94 %) was retained in the catchments, {{although there was a}} tendency for greater NO 3 -N leaching at sites receiving higher (< 7 kg ha(- 1) per year) bulk inorganic N deposition.

40|$|Human {{activities}} are increasingly altering {{the ways in}} which energy and elements cycle within and move between ecosystems. Through fossil fuel combustion and the use of synthetic fertilizers we continue to expose much of the biosphere to new rates and ratios of essential element supply. We are also shifting climate patterns on local, regional and global scales in ways that affect reaction rates and residence times of elements within ecosystems. Even the simplest ecosystems are usually too complex to predict many of the potential consequences that human activities will have on their sustained functioning. Because of this, we often monitor ecosystems as integrated wholes, looking to explain processes that account for important patterns observed across space and time. This dissertation consists of 3 data chapters, all of which use the small watershed ecosystem as the principal unit of study for understanding how human activities have altered element cycling in temperate forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In Chapter 2, we present results from repeated synoptic surveys of streamwater chemistry for ~ 30 watersheds spanning one of the largest nitrogen (N) deposition gradients in North America, located within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We primarily focus on patterns in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and composition across the N gradient, with particular attention given to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). DON dominates the global flux of N between terrestrial and aquatic systems, yet we have little understanding of how this prevailing N form responds to human N pollution. We found that DON concentrations often declined significantly with increasing catchment N loading and, through laboratory bioavailability assays, found that when N limitation is alleviated increased microbial demand for labile carbon (C) may drive this pattern. We use these findings to suggest a new hypothesis for the potential responses of DON to anthropogenic N pollution that accounts for the dual role that DON plays in both C and N cycles. Chapter 3 is an extension of Chapter 2, in which we attempt to assess the role of DON as either a C or N source within an entire stream reach through a series of independent manipulations of labile C and inorganic N availabilities. In the second order reach of Walker Branch, a well-studied stream in eastern Tennessee, we performed a series of progressive (i. e., sequentially increasing concentrations), kinetic (i. e., very short duration), enrichments of acetate and nitrate on two successive days during April of 2009 before the tree canopy emerged and when in-stream algal production was high. In this system and on these short timescales, we were unable to elicit the same responses observed at sites across the chronic N deposition gradient in Chapter 2. We did, however, observe that DOM processing and composition was significantly altered. Using fluorescence characterization of DOM, we found that adding acetate displaced heterotrophic demand for terrestrially derived DOM. Conversely, nitrate additions stimulated production of highly bioavailable autochthonous DOM within the stream channel, which resulted in an indirect displacement of demand for terrestrially derived DOM. Understanding DOM dynamics in streams has long been a priority for stream ecologists because it represents an important energy and nutrient source fueling stream metabolism. Our results provide new insight into the processes controlling DOM concentrations and composition in Walker Branch, as well as demonstrate the potential of this method for future investigations of DOM in stream ecosystems. Chapter 4 deviates from the preceding chapters' focus on N availability and ecosystem DOM dynamics, instead assessing the role of climate change on long-term streamwater concentrations and fluxes from the West Fork of the Walker Branch watershed. At this site, mean annual temperatures have increased by ~ 2 &# 730;C, while mean annual precipitation and runoff have declined by ~ 20 % and > 40 %, respectively, since 1989. We use weekly streamwater samples to assess trends in concentrations and fluxes for 9 different solutes over this period and, using wet deposition data, also evaluate changes in approximate watershed <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets.</b> The observed change in runoff was accompanied by a change in the proportional contributions of different soil flowpaths to streamflow generation through time, with deep groundwater playing an increasingly important role in recent years. Solutes that increase in concentration deeper in the soil profile exhibited significant increases in streamwater concentrations through time, while solutes with higher concentrations in soil solution in the upper profile decreased in concentration. Nutrient solutes, which exhibit much less variation across soil flowpaths, typically display large seasonal patterns in streamwater concentrations that are driven by in-stream biological uptake. However, most nutrient solutes exhibited little or no trend in concentrations through time, indicating that the biological controls on these solutes have remained relatively unaltered by the observed changes in climate over the 20 -year period. On shorter timescales, changes in the frequency or severity of multi-year droughts, as well as changes in the frequency or intensity of storms that disrupt in-stream uptake, can have large impacts on watershed <b>input-output</b> <b>budgets</b> of nutrient solutes even if the effects do not manifest as linear trends through time. Our results demonstrate the important role that changing climates can have on watershed element cycles, illustrating that climate effects can manifest through either changes in hydrologic regime or through changing biogeochemical process rates. Taken together, these chapters illustrate that human {{activities are}} indirectly but substantially changing biogeochemical cycles in temperate forests throughout the Southern Appalachians. Ecosystem structure and function depends on {{the ways in which}} energy and elements move within and between ecosystems. We rely on the sustained integrity of ecosystems for their many services and, because of this, it is essential that we understand ecosystem responses to current and future human impacts.

The work {{is a product of}} the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, a long-term study of urban and suburban ecosystems, and a component of the US National Science Founda-tion’s long-term ecological research (LTER) net-work. As expected, urban and suburban watersheds had much higher N losses than did the completely forested watershed, with N yields ranging from 2. 9 to 7. 9 kg N ha 1 y 1 in the urban and suburban watersheds compared with less than 1 kg N ha 1 y 1 in the completely forested watershed. Yields from urban and suburban watersheds were lower than those from an agricultural watershed (13 – 19. 8 kg N ha 1 y 1). Retention of N in the suburban watershed was surprisingly high, 75 % of inputs, which were dominated by home lawn fertilizer (14. 4 kg N ha 1 y 1) and atmospheric deposition (11. 2 kg N ha 1 y 1).

40|$|In the Vosges Mountains (NE of France), {{integrated}} plot-catchment {{studies have}} been carried out since 1985 in the Strengbach basin to study the influence of acid atmospheric inputs on surface water quality and element budgets. In this paper, available mid-term time series (1985 – 1991) have been considered to detect obvious trends, if any, in surface water chemistry and element budgets. Air quality data showed a slight decline for SO 2, whereas NO 2 slightly increased over the period, but these trends are not very significant. This is in agreement with increased N concentration (mainly as NH 4 +) and with the stability of SO 4 2 – in open field precipitation. Because of a significant decrease in rainfall amount over the period, only inputs of NH 4 + increased significantly whereas H+ and SO 4 2 + inputs declined. In spring and streamwaters, pH and dissolved Si concentration increased mainly {{as a result of a}} reduced flow. Na+, K+, Cl– and HCO- 3 ~– concentrations remained stable whereas Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and SO 4 2 + concentrations declined significantly. Only NO 3 – concentration increased significantly in springwaters. The catchment budgets revealed significant losses of base cations, Si and SO 4 2 –. These losses decreased over the period. Nitrogen was retained in the ecosystem.

40|$|Despite chronically {{enhanced}} nitrogen (N) deposition {{to forest}} ecosystems in Europe and NE America, considerable N retention by forests has been observed. It {{is still unclear}} which factors determine N retention in forest soils. However, this knowledge is crucial {{to assess the impact}} of changing anthropogenic N emissions on future N cycling and N loss of forests. For coniferous and deciduous forest stands at comparable sites, it is known that both N deposition to the forest floor as well as N loss by leaching below the rooting zone are significantly higher in coniferous stands (De Schrijver et al., 2007). In addition, the N loss in coniferous stands is often more enhanced than can be explained by the higher N input only, which suggests lower N retention by coniferous stands and may be related to differences in litter quality, microbial activity, and N uptake by plant roots. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of forest type on N retention. N dynamics were examined for two adjacent forest stands (pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)) on a well-drained soil type and with a similar stand history, which are located in a region with high N deposition (Belgium). Firstly, <b>input-output</b> N <b>budgets</b> were established by quantifying atmospheric deposition and leaching, which confirmed the above finding of higher N deposition and disproportionately higher N loss by the pine stand than the oak stand. Secondly, the fate of inorganic N within the ecosystems was studied by spraying dissolved 15 N onto the forest floor, both as ammonium (NH 4 +) and nitrate (NO 3 -). The 15 N recovery over time in organic and mineral soil layers, tree roots, water leaching, ferns, foliage, and stem wood was compared between the two forest stands and N treatments. Thirdly, in situ gross N transformation rates in undisturbed mineral forest soils were determined via a 15 N tracing approach (Müller et al., 2007). Meaningful differences between the two forest stands were found for the rates of mineralisation, heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrification, and NH 4 + and NO 3 - immobilisation. Unexpectedly, dissimilatory NO 3 - reduction to NH 4 + (DNRA) was detected in the oak soil. This process has mainly been described for unpolluted soils (e. g., Huygens et al., 2008), and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DNRA under field conditions in a temperate forest soil under high N deposition...|$|R

Inputs included bulk deposition, estimated dry deposition and weathering. Outputs were leaching and biomass exportation. Atmospheric deposition was the main input flux. The estimated dry deposition accounted for about 40 % of the total trace metal deposition. The relative importance of leaching (estimated by a lumped parameter water balance model, BILJOU) and net biomass uptake (harvesting) for ecosystem exportation depended on the element. Trace metal distribution between tree compartments (stem wood and bark, branches and needles) indicated that Pb was mainly stored in the stem, whereas Zn and Ni, {{and to a lesser extent}} Cd and Cu, were translocated to aerial parts of the trees and cycled in the ecosystem. For Zn and Ni, leaching was the main output flux (N 95 % of the total output) and the plot <b>budget</b> (<b>input–output)</b> was negative, whereas for Pb the biomass net exportation represented 60 % of the outputs and the budget was balanced. Cadmium and Cu had intermediate behaviours, with 18 % and 30 % of the total output relative to biomass exportation, respectively, and the budgets were negative.

40|$|Abstract. Cranberry bogs make up an {{important}} part of the landscape, economics, and cultural heritage of SE Massachusetts. Because cranberry bogs use ponds and rivers as water sources and as discharge points, the control of runoff of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to surface waters from cranberry farming is a concern for the health and management of fresh and estuarine waters in watersheds where cranberry bogs occur. We quantified the movement of N and P into and out of three cranberry bogs in the Weweantic and Wareham River Watersheds during one water year and annual cropping cycle. We combined measurements of water flow with measurements of dissolved and particulate N and P concentrations in different components of the annual farming cycle to estimate N and P <b>input-output</b> balances. Water <b>budgets</b> varied widely among bogs. Two bogs showed net movement of groundwater into the bog, one of which had very high inflow, and the third bog had net water flow into groundwater. Two bogs exhibited small net N imports (0. 1 and 2. 0 kg N ha- 1) in fluvial exchanges and one bog exhibited substantial N export (12. 6 kg N ha- 1). Between 73 and 77 % of all fluvial N exports exited in surface water during non-flood baseflows. Bogs exported between 2. 1 and 4. 5 kg P ha- 1 in fluvial exchanges and 55 and 81 % of all P export occurred during non-flood baseflows. High variability of net N exchange likely arose from the hydro-geographical setting in which the bogs occurred. The variation in the magnitude and direction of P exchanges was much less and depended less on bog setting. Given the finding of that most annual export of N and P occurred in surface water flows during times that water was not actively pumped onto or released from bogs, water management specifically aimed at N and P removal from the small but steady outflow of surface water during non-flood periods could be beneficial. Management might include additional storage time in ponds or increased naturalization of stream channels...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} way {{for assessing the}} nutrient status of an ecosystem is the establishment of nutrient <b>input-output</b> mass balance <b>budgets</b> at the catchment scale. For example, outputs (i. e. losses in streamwater, through havesting etc.) greater than inputs (i. e. weathering, dry and wet deposition, fertiliser) indicate that a depletion of the given element is taking place. In forest ecosystems, element input via throughfall is an important pathway in nutrient cycling. Precipitation interacts with the stand canopy, resulting in increased/decreased solute inputs to the forest floor. For example, acid deposition (H, N) may be substantially increased through the filtering action of the tree canopy. Indeed, canopy throughfall chemical composition includes wet deposition (rainfall), dry deposition intercepted by the canopy and elements leached from the foliar tissue (canopy leaching). Moreover, interactions between canopy and atmosphere or precipitation depend on several factors such as: season, tree species and physiology, stand structure and health. However, canopy leaching results from an internal nutrient cycling process. Ignoring this component in throughfall measurements thus leads to an overestimation of the inputs to the ecosystem. In this paper, main results of studies performed in the Belgian Ardennes at the watershed (80 ha) and plot scale are summarised. The aim {{of this research was}} to quantify long-term nutrient budgets in a forested watershed, within a context of sustainable management. In this area, soils are naturally acidic and poor in magnesium, so that forest dieback symptoms reported from 1983 onwards were related to increased pollution exacerbating magnesium deficiency. There is concern that acid (S and N) deposition, together with sylvicultural management (harvesting, spruce monocultures etc.) could deplete the available cation pool and that soils {{would not be able to}} support intensive sylviculture on the long term. We measured concentrations and fluxes of major ions in bulk deposition, throughfall and stream water over 13 years. Throughfall deposition under coniferous (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and several deciduous tree species was also compared. A canopy budget method was used for distinguishing between external (dry deposition) and internal (canopy leaching) sources of ions in the throughfall flux. The contribution of canopy leaching in throughfall measurements and consequences for mass balance calculations will be discussed. Furthermore, nutrient fluxes through the ecosystem will be examined with regard to the long term nutrient status of the system...|$|R
