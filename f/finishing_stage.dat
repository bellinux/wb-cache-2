25|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final <b>finishing</b> <b>stage</b> of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.|$|E
