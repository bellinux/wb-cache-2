But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive <b>in</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> major respects.|$|E

The ICC board ratified the recommendation, and the event took place in South Africa between 22 September and 5 October 2009.

25|$|An accumulator, Butt {{works hard}} for his runs, not indulging <b>in</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> big hits; his {{statistics}} show the {{low number of}} 19 international sixes to date (1 September 2010) of which he's scored 10 in Twenty20 cricket, 7 in One-Day Internationals and only six in Test cricket. He scores {{a lot of his}} runs between backward point and extra cover. He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using the pace of the ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is best to keep the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to third man if there are no slips, especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots. However, many commentators have expressed that his defensive technique has flaws, and that he is prone to playing at balls outside off-stump which should be left.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Mt.

Just prior to their Regional tournament, the IHSA learned that the school had competed <b>in</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> invitational tournaments, and disqualified the school from further competing as a team. Mt. Carmel did not deny the assertion; however, they claimed that one of the varsity tournaments had only had JV and frosh-soph wrestlers competing. Mt. Carmel won a temporary injunction from the Cook County Circuit Court to permit their team to compete in the regionals. While the individual tournaments progressed, Mt. Carmel won a court victory, which forced the IHSA to permit the team to wrestle. When the IHSA's appeal was denied, and after temporarily suspending the tournament, the IHSA decided to end the season without a Class AA state championship dual team tournament; {{the first time in the}} history of the Association that a state tournament had been cancelled due to a cause other than war.|$|E

500|$|In his {{preview of}} the 2009 season for ESPNcricinfo, Andrew McGlashan {{identified}} Somerset's opening partnerships with bat and ball as their main strengths, but predicted that the middle order would struggle {{to make an impact}} in the County Championship, stating that [...] "none [...] jump out as potential match-winners in four-day cricket." [...] He speculated that the team's best chance of success would come in the one-day competitions. The Daily Telegraph provided a more positive outlook, claiming that the county had [...] "enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge [...] again." [...] They identified spin bowling as an area of weakness following the departure of Blackwell. Bob Willis, writing in The Guardian, shared this view, and predicted that Somerset would also be hindered by the difficulty of getting 20 wickets at home, resulting <b>in</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> draws.|$|E

He believed that his House audition was not particularly good, but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson. Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein's portrayal of a prostitute on The West Wing, and sent her a copy of the pilot script. Edelstein was attracted {{to the quality of the}} writing and her character's [...] "snappy dialogue" [...] with House, and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy.|$|E

500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and <b>in</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that was what he was supposed to do".|$|E
500|$|Terry-Thomas's final {{film with}} the Boulting {{brothers}} was I'm All Right Jack, a post-war follow-up to Private's Progress with Terry-Thomas reprising {{the role of}} Major Hitchcock to an industrial setting, as the [...] "tetchily incompetent" [...] personnel manager. Many of the other cast from Private's Progress also returned, including Attenborough, Carmichael and Dennis Price; {{they were joined by}} Peter Sellers, who took most of the plaudits from the critics, although Stanley Kauffman, writing in The New Republic also delighted in Terry-Thomas's [...] "finesse" [...] and [...] "extraordinary skill". The Los Angeles Times retrospectively considered I'm All Right Jack and Carlton-Browne of the F.O. to have been Terry-Thomas's best works. His final film of 1959 was as William Delany Gordon <b>in</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Many</b> Crooks. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times thought that Terry-Thomas provided [...] "some of the fieriest conniptions to be seen on the contemporary screen", going on to say that the actor's [...] "skill is exercised in demonstrating how magnificently and completely a mad-cap comedian can completely blow his top. His eyes flash, his lips curl, his sibilants whistle and he glares like a maniac". Filming took place during the daytime; in the evenings he appeared at the London Palladium, something he found trying on his nervous system.|$|E
