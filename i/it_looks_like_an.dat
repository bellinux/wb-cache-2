It is about one third the {{diameter}} of the Great Dark Spot and received the nickname [...] "Wizard's Eye" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud {{in the middle of the}} Wizard's Eye. Mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms. Jovian storms like the Great Red Spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.|$|E

It is found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, northwards from the Puget Sound along the British Columbia coast (including the Queen Charlotte Islands), along the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to the far eastern Bering Sea coast of Russia, and may also occur on the Kuril Islands and the coasts of Kamchatka.

500|$|These rules often {{force the}} {{placement}} of certain tiles: for example, the concave vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an [...] "ace" [...] by Conway; although <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way. Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures [...] namely, the [...] "star" [...] (top left) and the [...] "sun" [...] (top right) [...] have 5-fold dihedral symmetry (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image). Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force {{the placement of}} additional tiles.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine piece was considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked questions about the bill's provisions, {{though he did not}} object to its passage. When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda. [...] Gard expressed his concerns about commemorative coins, [...] "but {{for the life of me}} I can not see what advantage there is for a State celebration to gather up a lot of coins with a particular stamp on them.

Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and Soubin Saheer but criticized the script, saying, [...] "Loham is about a topical subject, but it is far from engaging". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee said that technically the film is slick with well shot sequences.

2500|$|Many {{ghost stories}} in the region combine these elements. For instance, they might involve a protagonist who fails to flee or take {{countermeasures}} when they run across a bhoot. Instead, they unwittingly accept the bhoot's companionship (e.g., makes the ghost a companion as he/she walks through a forest, picks up the ghost in his car because <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> attractive woman waiting by the roadside at night). They become progressively aware that their companion is dressed entirely in white and has a funnily nasal voice, before the horrifying realization dawns on them that their companion's feet are turned backwards, [...] or he/she is not casting a shadow in the moonlight, or is walking without actually touching the ground. Bhoots are said to seek out milk and immerse themselves in it. Consuming bhoot-contaminated milk is considered a typical route for bhoot-possession of humans, which {{has also been a}} frequent plot element in bhoot stories.|$|E

At the 1975 USSR junior Championships Davydova {{finished}} 3rd AA and won golds on vault and bars. Following her success here she {{became a member of}} the senior squad. In March 1976 Davydova [...] achieved 2nd place All-Around at the USSR championships, in her first try as a senior. She also won the gold on bars and a silver on floor. In the Sovetskii Sport magazine Ally Svirsky wrote [...] "Davydova's exercise included a complex salto between the bars". She added [...] " [...] Davydova's routines were adorned with many original parts. For example, she took her hands off in a handstand on the high bar and changed the position of her hands. She earned a 10.0". Another Soviet paper wrote [...] "She is so fast <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aeroplane propellor is whirling". At the inaugural American Cup, Davydova astonished the gymnastics world by performing a side somersault on the beam, the first woman to do so. However, she only received 3rd place AA, due to her poor health in the match. The competition was won by Nadia Comăneci, whose gymnastics Yelena Davydova greatly admired. At the USSR Cup Davydova tied for 6th place AA – and won bronze on vault, only 0.025 behind world vault championOlga Korbut — but only the top 5 and one gymnast in 9th place were chosen for the Soviet Olympic team. Sovetski Sport, 22 June 1976, [...] "We won't anticipate the decision of the Training Council who must name the members of the Olympic team. But we shall note that the new wave – M. Filatova, N. Shaposhnikova, E. Davydova and O. Koval – were well prepared and appear to be more useful than the more experienced sportsmen" [...] Larisa Latynina, who had won 18 Olympic medals – a record for either gender in any sport, was the senior coach for the team, and was determined to uphold the classical gymnastics tradition against the new athletic school of gymnastics as represented by Comaneci, Davydova and others.

60|$|We {{climbed the}} moraine on the {{opposite}} side of the glacier, and then crept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so, in pretty constant danger of a tumble to the glacier below. The fall would have been only one hundred feet, but it would have closed me out as effectually as one thousand, therefore I respected the distance accordingly, and was glad when the trip was done. A moraine is an ugly thing to assault head-first.

All this glory disappears when the bird is dead, and even when it alights to rest on a bough. Sitting still, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exceedingly attenuated kingfisher, without the pretty plumage of that bird, but retaining its stiff artificial manner. No artist has been so bold as to attempt to depict the bird as it actually appears, when balanced before a flower the swift motion of the wings obliterates their form, making them seem like a mist encircling the body; yet {{it is precisely this}} formless cloud on which the glittering body hangs suspended, which contributes most to give the humming-bird its wonderful sprite-like or extra-natural appearance. How strange, then, to find bird-painters persisting in their efforts to show the humming-bird flying!
