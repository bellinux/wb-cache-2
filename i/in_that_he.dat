5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

50|$|On 24 April 1897 Vivekananda wrote {{a letter}} to Sarala Ghoshal. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> letter <b>he</b> {{stressed}} giving the public only positive education, because of his belief that negative thoughts weaken men. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> letter, <b>he</b> also reiterated this sloka.|$|R
5|$|Many {{elements}} in the panel incorporate earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, Bosch is innovative <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> describes hell not as a fantastical space, but as a realistic world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
50|$|He {{started playing}} in Indonesia in 2003, joining PSM Makassar. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> season <b>he</b> scored 27 goals.

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|The accused Fritz Knöchlein, a German national, in {{the charge}} of the Hamburg Garrison Unit, {{pursuant}} to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals, is charged with committing a war crime <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{in the vicinity of}} Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the killing of about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} one of Ippo's senpai, Masaru Aoki, who has been boxing {{for a number of}} years before Ippo. He enters the Class A Tournament, but loses. Afterward, he begins his {{comeback}} and rises through the Lightweight division to win the Lightweight Championship against Katsutaka Imae. Aoki's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of the fights, and achieved a draw in the Title bout. After Aoki's story arc, the game shifts again to another of Ippo's senpai, Tatsuya Kimura, who began boxing with Aoki. His story is very similar to Aoki's <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also enters the Class A Tournament and loses. Afterward, he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior Lightweight Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba. Kimura's story is also different than the manga <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lost several of the fights and did not become the Junior Lightweight Champion.|$|E

5|$|Whedon's use {{of music}} in his {{television}} shows has been regarded as 'filmic', <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been argued {{to use it to}} remind viewers at 'pivotal moments' of earlier events, resulting in a tighter continuity throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} {{editorial}} director in 2008, and {{was followed by}} Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not have a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|Detractors {{have raised}} {{concerns}} over Lichtenstein's appropriation, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> directly references imagery {{from other sources}} in Whaam! and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí {{was inspired by}} oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was first}} {{published}} during {{the early days of}} the Modern Age of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often places their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano would be the first to put his political views in the series, an element never before seen in mainstream comics, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled A Fistful of Dynamite. Leone was initially dissatisfied with his performance <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident {{that ended with}} Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.|$|E
5|$|Katharine Hepburn {{joined the}} cast in mid-April 1942 after Stewart {{sent her a}} copy of the {{unfinished}} script. Hepburn was fascinated by the character of Christine, and felt that doing the film would be a way of contributing to the war effort. MGM executives did not want Hepburn attached to the picture, feeling it was an inappropriate follow-up for her (first) previous pairing with Tracy in Woman of the Year (1942), but Hepburn insisted, and MGM relented. Hepburn showed some concerns with Stewart's redrafting of the script, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> toned down the novel's love story, placing more emphasis on the character of O'Malley role and the action. She asked for more romance in the film. Although Hepburn had spent much of the prior year searching for scripts with equally strong male and female parts for her and Tracy, she now requested that the O'Malley role be restored to the function it served in the novel (where O'Malley is impotent, troubled, and despairing of love) and her own part expanded. Film producer Victor Saville threatened to resign if the changes were made, and Spencer Tracy supported him, which led to the changes being rejected.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
