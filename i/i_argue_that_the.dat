40|$|I’m {{grateful}} to Dr. Martindale for introducing {{the reader to}} an important and lively debate among practitioners and academics over the relevance of recent research on children’s suggestibility. In my Cornell Law Review article, <b>I</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recent research on suggestibility was inspired by highly coercive interviewing techniques in widely publicized cases <b>that</b> are not <b>the</b> norm in child sexual abuse investigations. These techniques include telling children {{that they have been}} abused, telling children that a particular person is the abuser, and asking children to imagine details regarding how abuse could have taken place. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> research fails to mirror factors in real-world sexual-abuse cases <b>that</b> reduce <b>the</b> likelihood <b>that</b> false allegations will occur. These factors include the age of the child, children’s reluctance to accuse loved ones of immoral acts, and children’s embarrassment regarding sexual topics. My goal was to alert judges, attorneys, and child-abuse professionals to the importance of carefully examining the methods used by researchers before concluding that research applies to a particular case. Certainly there are cases in which highly coercive tactics have been used, and in which expert testimony on the dangers of such tactics is justified.

In this article, I discuss how the EU enlargement affects {{the member states}} of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The empirical focus is {{the impact on the}} Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), which is of key importance in regulating the relationship between the EU and EFTA. <b>I</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enlargement process has not challenged fundamentally the existenceof the EEA Agreement nor its institutions.

40|$|Research on the persuasive {{power of}} money {{has focused on}} money's {{instrumental}} function, and thus addressed the question "What money does for people'. This dissertation, however, analyzed the persuasive effect of money by focusing on money's cognitive effects. In doing so, it addressed the question 'What money does to people'. <b>I</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> besides money's instrumental value (i. e., money allows people to buy things), money has specific cognitive effects, which ultimately determine whether money will change behavior in the intended way. I explored this notion in four empirical chapters. First, <b>I</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> persuasive power of money increases when financial incentives involve the prospect of losing, rather than gaining money. Specifically, financial incentives can be perceived as involving either the opportunity to gain or to lose money, depending on whether rewards involve ones own or new money (Chapter 2), and on how rewards are communicated (Chapter 3). Second, <b>I</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> persuasive power of money may be limited when the desire to obtain money {{is perceived to be}} in confict with competing goals. Specifically, the pursuit of money may be in confict with the goal to avoid taboo trade-offs (viz., trading privacy for money; Chapter 4), and with the goal to preserve a moral self-concept (Chapter 5). The main findings of the four empirical chapters are presented, along with their practical and theoretical implications. ...|$|R
