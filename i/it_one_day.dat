Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that they come out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", {{which is the first}} Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives {{eventually}} expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa.

The song [...] "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] has been described as [...] "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, [...] "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything.

It was the subject of one of Edward Steichen's atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by Alfred Stieglitz taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage.
