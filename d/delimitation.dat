5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species <b>delimitation</b> in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species <b>delimitation</b> in the genus. Volvopluteus michiganensis is distinguished from other species of Volvopluteus by its relatively shorter spores, measuring on average less than 12.5µm long.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples.

5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry and Hunting Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a preliminary project for the <b>delimitation</b> of the Cordillera Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 hectares. On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species {{in the area of the}} Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated <b>delimitation</b> proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the vicuña and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares. Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 hectares.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the Czech {{invasion}} in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were {{to be held in}} the whole of Cieszyn Silesia.

When the Czech demand was rejected by the Poles, the Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force.|$|E

5|$|Kanchipuram Lok Sabha {{constituency}} is a {{newly formed}} constituency of the Parliament of India after the 2008 <b>delimitation.</b> The constituency originally existed for the 1951 election, and {{was formed in}} 2008 after merging the assembly segments of Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Madurantakam (SC), Uthiramerur and Kanchipuram, which {{were part of the}} now defunct Chengalpattu constituency, and Alandur, which was part of the Chennai South constituency. This constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) candidates. K. Maragatham from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is the current Member of Parliament for the constituency. Indian writer, politician and founder of the DMK, C. N. Annadurai, {{was born and raised in}} Kanchipuram.

5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} sense, to mean the <b>delimitation</b> of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species {{is even more important}} for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic {{language}}s. The <b>delimitation</b> of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} the first and only volume by Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas, and their {{intention}} was not only to define and describe the lands that were populated by Greeks, but also to describe the current social developments in the wider region. With this work they gave a precise <b>delimitation</b> of European Hellas (Greece) of that time, a few decades before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821). According to their description this area would not only include present-day Greece, but also Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and the southern half of Bulgaria, an area that included all the areas ruled by the Macedonian Kings, in addition to those of classical Greece incorporating most of the Orthodox populations of the Balkan peninsula, which was during that time under Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the <b>delimitation</b> of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
