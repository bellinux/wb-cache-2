5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E

5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} Functionalism. This, in turn, {{has evolved into}} more recent world-class masterpieces such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge {{paving the way for}} a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence both at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, Danish {{architecture}} has flourished both at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> Two important areas of Greater Copenhagen have provided substantial opportunities for architectural developments on the domestic front while a number of firms have gained international recognition, winning important commissions abroad.

5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} embarrassment to the {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad</b> through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff.

5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany.

The {{best known}} winegrowing areas of Slavonia are centered on Đakovo, Ilok and Kutjevo, where Graševina grapes are predominant, but other cultivars are increasingly present. In past decades, an increasing quantity of wine production in Slavonia was accompanied by increasing quality and growing recognition at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> Grape vines were first grown {{in the region of}} Ilok, as early as the 3rd century AD. The oldest Slavonian wine cellar still in continuous use for winemaking is located in Kutjevo—built in 1232 by Cistercians.|$|E

5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad.</b> He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad</b> as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had ever been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad</b> and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>abroad</b> between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E

Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at <b>Home</b> <b>and</b> <b>Abroad,</b> which was published in 1941.

He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E
