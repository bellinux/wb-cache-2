Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E

A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced.</b> The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E

Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced.</b> This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company.

5|$|Leopold, however, {{reneged on}} his {{humanitarian}} promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals {{and the land}} to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export, which allowed the colony to become extremely profitable for the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, and the Force Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect it. In some cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely profitable, but {{the population of the}} Congo is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control.|$|E

From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop {{around the perimeter of}} North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes.

Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced,</b> their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

5|$|Several taxa {{have been}} named as {{belonging}} to the genus Sarcosphaera over the years, but most lack modern descriptions and have not been reported since their original collections. For example, Sarcosphaera funerata was renamed by Fred Jay Seaver in 1930 based on the basionym Peziza funerata, originally described by Cooke in 1878. Sarcosphaera gigantea was a species collected from Michigan, originally described as Pustularia gigantea by Heinrich Rehm in 1905, and considered distinct from S.coronaria {{on the basis of}} its smaller spore size. Sarcosphaera ulbrichiana was described by Wilhem Kirschstein in 1943. Other taxa <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to synonymy with S.coronaria, or transferred to other genera. Sarcosphaera eximia (originally Peziza eximia Durieu & Lév. 1848, and later transferred to Sarcosphaera by René Maire), Sarcosphaera crassa (considered by Zdeněk Pouzar in a 1972 publication to be the correct name for S.coronaria) and Sarcosphaera dargelasii (originally Peziza dargelasii Gachet 1829, transferred to Sarcosphaera by Nannfeldt) are now considered synonyms of S.coronaria. Sarcosphaera ammophila (originally Peziza ammophila Durieu & Mont.) and Sarcosphaera amplissima (originally Peziza amplissima Fr. 1849) have since been transferred back to Peziza. The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) considers Sarcosphaera to be monotypic, and Index Fungorum has only Sarcosphaera coronaria confirmed as valid.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E
