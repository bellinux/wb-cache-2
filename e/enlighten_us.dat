This is the man--the best of doctors and good fellows." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the very name of Typee struck a panic into my heart which I {{did not attempt}} to disguise. The thought of voluntarily {{throwing}} ourselves into the hands of these cruel savages, seemed to me an act of mere madness; and almost equally so the idea of venturing into the valley, uncertain by which of these two tribes it was inhabited. That the vale at our feet was tenanted by one of them, was a point that appeared to us past all doubt, since we knew that they resided in this quarter, although our information did not <b>enlighten</b> <b>us</b> further.|$|E
40|$|Ernesto Laclau, one of {{the most}} {{significant}} political scientists of the 20 th century, talks about his theoretical work and expresses his views on current events.

5000|$|Asked {{during the}} same {{interview}} by Halloran why Waas had chosen not only not to appear on cable television shows, but had also been known to decline to go on such shows as Nightline and Meet the Press, he responded: [...] "There's not much of it that really <b>enlightens</b> <b>us.</b> There are journalists who don't do journalism anymore.

60|$|We {{were all}} sitting on deck together, {{those of us}} who were not on duty, and {{listening}} to yarns from one another, as idle men will, when the conversation happened accidentally to turn on Queensland, and Lemarchant began to <b>enlighten</b> <b>us</b> about his own doings when he was in the colony. He boasted a great deal about his prowess as a disperser of the black fellows, which he seemed to consider a very noble sort of occupation. There was nobody in the colony, he said, who had ever dispersed so many blacks as he had; and he'd like to be back there, dispersing again, for, in the matter of sport, it beat kangaroo-hunting, or any other kind of shooting he had ever yet tried his hand at, all to pieces.|$|E
60|$|LORD, <b>enlighten</b> <b>us</b> to see {{the beam}} that is in our own eye, and blind us to the mote that is in our brother's. Let us feel our {{offences}} with our hands, make them great and bright before us like the sun, make us eat them and drink them for our diet. Blind us to the offences of our beloved, cleanse them from our memories, {{take them out of}} our mouths for ever. Let all here before Thee carry and measure with the false balances of love, and be in their own eyes and in all conjunctures the most guilty. Help us at the same time with the grace of courage, that we be none of us cast down when we sit lamenting amid the ruins of our happiness or our integrity: touch us with fire from the altar, that we may be up and doing to rebuild our city: in the name and by the method of him in whose words of prayer we now conclude.|$|E
60|$|N.B.--Perhaps it was Oliver Twist or The Old Curiosity Shop--I am {{not certain}} {{which was the}} current {{excitement}} just then; but I am quite sure it was Mrs. Nickleby who first disclosed to us that our guest had a splendid pair of dark eyes. Hitherto he had kept them averted in the studious manner I have often noticed in persons who {{did not wish to}} excite suspicion of staring at my peculiarities; but that lady's feelings when her neighbour's legs came down her chimney were too much for his self-consciousness, and he gave a glance that disclosed dark liquid depths, sparkling with mirth. He was one number in advance of us, and could <b>enlighten</b> <b>us</b> on the next stage in the coming story; and this went far to reconcile us to the invasion, and to restore him to the proper use of his legs and arms--and very shapely limbs they were, for he was a slim, well-made fellow, with a dark gipsy complexion, and intelligent, honest face, altogether better than we expected.|$|E
30|$|Hannum {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} DNA methylation sequencing {{to examine the}} relationship between DNA methylome and aging rate. Notably, they succeeded in building a quantitative and reproducible model based on the epigenetic bio-markers to predict aging rate with high accuracy. This progress <b>enlightens</b> <b>us</b> in many aspects particularly in applying this novel set of bio-markers on studying the mechanism of aging rate using adult tissue-specific stem cells, building up a potential quantitative model to explore the mechanism for other epigenetic factors like non-coding RNA, and understanding the principle and mechanism of 3 D chromatin structure in epigenetic modulation.|$|R
40|$|A {{serious concern}} within the {{territory}} of the ethics language is represented by the endeavour to continuously clarify even the basic concepts of ethics, morals, and morality. Face to the reality as regards moral philosophy in its wholeness and dynamics, as a very complex and dilemmatic field of knowledge and practice, we {{have to take into account}} the temptations to pointing out the significance of its very own terminology. In this paper we aim to emphasize some of the relevant contributions to <b>enlightening</b> <b>us,</b> in a proper way, about a sort of resemanticization especially focused on the above mentioned concepts...|$|R

Dr. Pategama Gnanarama <b>enlightens</b> <b>us</b> {{in many areas of}} subjects hitherto unexplored by scholars. His views on the beginnings of the Bhikkhuni Order are interesting and refreshing.

60|$|Mr. Scott {{does not}} seem {{to know more about the}} Mysteries than Mr. Macdonald, and his article on Mulungu does not much <b>enlighten</b> <b>us.</b> Does Mulungu, as Creative God, receive sacrifice, or not?[14] Mr. Scott gives no {{instance}} of this, under Nsembe (sacrifice), where ancestors, or hill-dwelling ghosts of chiefs, are offered food; yet, as we have seen, under Mulungu, he avers that the chiefs and people do sacrifice to God. He appears to be confusing the Creator with spirits, and no reliance can be placed on this part of his evidence. 'At the back of all this' (sacrifice to spirits) 'there is God.' If I understand Mr. Scott, sacrifices are really made only to spirits, but he is trying to argue that, after all, the theistic conception is at the back of the animistic practice, thus importing his theory into his facts. His theory would, really, be in a better way, if sacrifice is not offered to the Creator, but this had not occurred to Mr. Scott.|$|E
6000|$|As far as archaeological {{excavations}} and discoveries <b>enlighten</b> <b>us,</b> these relative uses {{of bronze}} and iron {{did not exist}} in the ages of Mycenaean culture which are represented in the tholos of Vaphio and the graves, earlier and later, of Mycenae. Even in the later Mycenaean graves iron is found only in the form of finger rings (iron rings were common in late Greece). [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, pp. 72, 146, 165.] Iron was scarce in the Cypro- Mycenaean graves of Enkomi. A small knife with a carved handle had left traces of an iron blade. A couple of lumps of iron, one of them apparently the head of a club, were found in Schliemann's [...] "Burned City" [...] at Hissarlik; for the rest, swords, spear-heads, knives, and axes are all of bronze in the age called [...] "Mycenaean." [...] But we do not know whether iron implements may not yet be found in the sepulchres of Thetes, and other poor and landless men. The latest discoveries in Minoan graves in Crete exhibit tools of bronze.|$|E
60|$|The English {{reader will}} draw from this work of Brissot, {{and from the}} result of the last struggles of this party, some useful lessons. He will be enabled to judge of the {{information}} of those who have undertaken to guide and <b>enlighten</b> <b>us,</b> and who, for reasons best known to themselves, have chosen to paint the French Revolution and its consequences in brilliant and flattering colors. They will know how to appreciate the liberty of France, which has been so much magnified in England. They will do justice to the wisdom and goodness of their sovereign and his Parliament, who have put them into a state of defence, in the war audaciously made upon us in favor of that kind of liberty. When we see (as here we must see) in their true colors the character and policy of our enemies, our gratitude will become an active principle. It will produce a strong and zealous coöperation with the efforts of our government in favor of a Constitution under which we enjoy advantages the full value of which the querulous weakness of human nature requires sometimes the opportunity of a comparison to understand and to relish.|$|E
