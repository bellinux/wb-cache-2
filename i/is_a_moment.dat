5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.|$|E

25|$|One {{year from}} Season 4, Lucas becomes {{the head coach}} of the Cobras, his college {{basketball}} team, and leads them to victory in the championships. Thinking about his future, he goes to see Peyton and asks her to marry him. She declines, feeling that it is too soon. As he is about to leave LA, his novel is picked up by a fresh new editor, Lindsey Strauss. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when his greatest dream came true. He is about to call Peyton, but decides against it, and instead calls Brooke. They spend a crazy evening together, and, in the end, he kisses her because he feels lonely. Although Brooke still loves him at the time, she pushes him away, remembering Peyton. Soon after, he is scheduled to have a book signing in LA where Peyton is living and working. Having missed her, he calls her and invites her to come to the signing. Peyton comes, but she witnesses Lindsey giving Lucas a congratulatory kiss and assumes they are in a relationship and leaves thinking there is no hope for her and Lucas. Lucas thinks that Peyton did not bother to come, and consequently begins dating Lindsey.|$|E

I thought: [...] 'This is it. It is a three-minute game for our season, {{everything}} you've been working for your whole life.' I smiled, and went for it. That was the most surreal moment.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126–0 {{in favor of a}} {{constitutional}} amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic. [...] A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: [...] "For me, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] The new state became the Republic of Singapore, with Yusof bin Ishak appointed as its first President.|$|E

500|$|Part of {{the story}} {{involves}} the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns [...] "Dr. Fell"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate {{the death of a}} gypsy pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as [...] "very thoughtful". Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption. Starling does not, however, and perseveres to the end, even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself.|$|E
500|$|From Rite to Ritual {{examined}} {{relationships between}} Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described {{the work as}} showing [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief". Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the [...] "surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references" [...] made the work [...] "outstanding" [...] and of [...] "great complexity and grace". Art writer Nicolas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel [...] "between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikey MiGo of 411mania {{wrote that}} the song is a [...] "welcomed change" [...] from Timberlake's past work. She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never seen anyone muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's pressed up on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> alone, to give you my tongue and {{get you out of}} control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical." [...] She concluded that [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] establishes a pattern for the rest of FutureSex/LoveSounds: [...] "infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music, marred by retardedly retarded lyrics".|$|E

500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} big push. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who would have noticed another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also {{said that it was}} great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E
500|$|Underwood's {{sexuality}} is ambiguous {{throughout much of}} the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in [...] "Chapter 8" [...] he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being [...] "secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks). The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.|$|E

500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E
500|$|Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) {{is being}} {{released}} from a military prison for unknown reasons. Upon leaving, he runs into Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) and Desmond {{while he was in}} prison, and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship. Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Charles Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island. He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit, Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) (who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks) who takes him to the [...] The two live together for three years before Desmond finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond's boat. Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down, Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the hatch door, and turns on a light. Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself.|$|E
