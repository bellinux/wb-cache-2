Amerike sponsored the explorer John Cabot, who sailed from Bristol in 1497 and discovered Newfoundland and is now believed by some scholars to have given his patronymic to name the continent of America.|$|E

From the beginning of Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons of which had been dropped during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|In June 1929, the Copiaus {{formed a}} new troupe, La Compagnie des Quinze, led by Michel Saint-Denis.

25|$|After a large {{demonstration}} in 1930, the Mexican Communist Party was banned, Mexico stopped {{its support for}} the rebels of César Sandino in Nicaragua, strikes were no longer tolerated, and the government ceased re-distributing lands amongst poorer peasants.

25|$|The Ottoman Empire <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{foremost}} {{military power}} in Europe, reaching its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, when it posed {{a serious threat}} to Christian Europe. Its armies overran the entire Balkan peninsula and Greece, and reached the borders of Austria, laying siege to Vienna twice (in 1529 and 1683). Its fleets dominated the Mediterranean Sea. However, the Ottomans had gradually fallen behind the other European powers, as they failed to modernise their political institutions, economic system and military forces. During the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire steadily lost territory in eastern Europe to the neighbouring Austrian and Russian empires (which annexed Hungary and southern Russia, respectively).|$|E

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Yekuno Amlak is based on oral traditions and medieval hagiographies. Yekuno Amlak was educated at Lake Hayq's Istifanos Monastery near Amba Sel, where later medieval hagiographies state Saint Tekle Haymanot raised and educated him, and helped him to depose the last King of the Zagwe Dynasty. Earlier hagiographies, however, state that it was Iyasus Mo'a, the abbot of Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq, who helped him achieve power. G.W.B. Huntingford {{explains}} this discrepancy by pointing out Istifanos <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> premier monastery of Ethiopia, but Tekle Haymanot's Debre Libanos eventually eclipsed Istifanos, and from the reign of Amda Seyon it became the custom to appoint the abbot of Debre Libanos Ichege, or secular head of the Ethiopian Church. However, neither of these traditions is contemporary with any of the individuals involved.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese invading forces {{landed in}} Sandakan on January 19, 1942. For {{the first few}} months of Japanese {{occupation}} of British Borneo, the Keiths were allowed to stay in their own home. On 12 May Agnes and George were imprisoned on Berhala Island (Pulau Berhala) near Sandakan, in a building that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Government Quarantine Station, along with other Western women and children. Harry was imprisoned nearby. They spent eight months there before Agnes and George were sent to Kuching in Sarawak. They left by a small steamer on January 12, 1943, and arrived eight days later. They were imprisoned in Batu Lintang camp near Kuching, unusual in that it accommodated both prisoners of war and civilian internees in between eight and ten separate compounds. Harry later arrived at the camp. The camp was finally liberated on 11 September 1945 by the 9th Australian Army Division under the command of Brigadier T. C. Eastick. All three members of the Keith family had survived their internment.|$|E

500|$|Green Lake, Texas is {{the setting}} for Louis Sachar's 1998 novel Holes, and the 2003 film adaptation.

After a long drought, the lake dried up and the area became a ghost town. Juvenile delinquents were sent to Camp Green Lake to dig holes in the lakebed as punishment.|$|E
500|$|Around 461 BC, the {{leadership}} of the democratic party {{decided it was time to}} take aim at the Areopagus, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> most powerful body in the state. The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, Ephialtes, proposed a reduction of the Areopagus' powers. The Ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) adopted Ephialtes' proposal without opposition. This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of [...] "radical democracy".|$|E

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Terminus' associations could extend from property boundaries to limits more generally. Under the Republican calendar, when the intercalary month Mercedonius was added to a year, it was placed after February 23 or February 24, and some ancient writers believed that the Terminalia on February 23 <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> end of the year. Diocletian's decision in 303 AD to initiate his persecution of Christians on February 23 has been seen as an attempt at enlisting Terminus [...] "to put a limit to the progress of Christianity".|$|E
500|$|Byzantine counter {{artillery}} {{allowed them}} to repel any visible Turkish weapons, and the defenders repulsed any attempts to storm any broken points in the walls and hastily repaired any damage. However, the walls could not be adapted for artillery, and towers were not good gun emplacements. There was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon. Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating Greek fire obsolete, and with the final fall of what <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> strongest walls in Europe on May 29, [...] "it {{was the end of}} an era in more ways than one".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1840 campaign, the Log Cabins {{circulation}} {{had risen}} to 80,000 and Greeley decided to establish a daily newspaper, the New-York Tribune. At the time, New York had many newspapers, dominated by James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald, which with a circulation of about 55,000 had more readers than its combined competition. As technology advanced, it became cheaper and easier to publish a newspaper, and the daily press came to dominate the weekly, which <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> more common format for news periodicals. [...] Greeley borrowed money from friends to get started, and published the first issue of the Tribune on April 10, 1841—the day of a memorial parade in New York for President Harrison, who had died after a month in office and been replaced by Vice President Tyler.|$|E
