5000|$|During this time, the University of Chicago {{had emerged}} as the birthplace isotope geochemistry, and Harold Urey's {{research}} group was making significant advancements {{in the use of}} deviations in stable isotopes to measure ancient ocean temperatures. While working as a geologist in Illinois State Geological Survey's Coal, and Stratigraphy and Paleontology Divisions, Heinz was invited to join Harold Urey's group to aid in acquiring fossil materials. He accepted a position as a research associate in geochemistry at the University of Chicago and by 1950, was convinced to accept a faculty position. This position allowed Heinz to" [...] continue his research on Silurian reefs, as well as to extend his search for pristine fossil shell materials, an interest that later paved the way for his studies on biomineralization". [...] In the early 1950s, Caltech and the University of California began the building of their isotope geochemistry programs and their recruitment of young scientists from Urey's group and the geochemists of the Chicago [...] "mafia" [...] to form the core of their departments. By the time Lowenstam accepted his faculty position at Caltech in 1954, many of his colleagues including Harrison Brown, Sam Epstein, Clair Patterson, and even Harold Urey had already made the migration. Under his chosen title as a [...] "paleoecologist" [...] Heinz continued to collaborate with his former research group (Brown, Patterson, and Epstein were all at Caltech), but he also used the opportunity to explore more comprehensive geochemical analyses of fossil formation. Lowenstam sought to develop <b>geochemical</b> <b>methods</b> to gain insight into the biological processes through which organisms control mineralization as well as derive information about ancient ecosystems, such as salinity and barometric pressure. For these studies, he turned to the environments of modern coral reef systems in Bermuda. In his early work in the region, Heinz discovered that the aragonite (a CaCO3 mineral produce by reef organisms) [...] "needles forming most of the sedimentary mass in Bermuda's back-reef lagoons of Bermuda were produced by microscopic algae; using carbon and oxygen isotopes to prove their biological origin". [...] But it was Lowenstam's 1961 discovery of [...] "biochemically-precipitated magnetite (Fe3O4) as a capping material in the radula (tongue plate)teeth of chitons (marine mollusks)" [...] that was to shape the future of biomineralization. [...] "Prior to this discovery, magnetite was thought to form only in igneous or metamorphic rocks under high temperatures and pressures". [...] In his 1962 paper Heinz noted the implications of his discovery with his observation that the chitons were known for their local homing instinct, implying that they may be using a magnetite compass to aid in navigation. Subsequent researchers building upon this work have [...] "confirmed the central role of magnetite as the biophysical transducer of the magnetic field in living organisms spanning the evolutionary spectrum from the magnetotactic bacteria to mammals, with a fossil record extending back at least 2 billion years on Earth and perhaps 4 billion years on Mars". [...] Lowenstam left implications of biomagnetism for others to explore and continued to pursue answers to how organisms control mineral formation. Over the next two decades Heinz continued to discover and catalog biologically precipitated minerals and document their phyletic distribution, as well as attempt to track their evolutionary origin. Heinz A. Lowenstam was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980 and received an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Munich that same year.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} compares palynological {{evidence for}} changes in land use histories with a <b>geochemical</b> <b>method</b> for reconstructing past soil erosion. Changes in land use have significant effects on soil erosion. It has been shown elsewhere that silicon (Si) and titanium (Ti) are good proxies for soil erosion. Ombrotrophic peat bogs are useful archives in which to measure Si and Ti depositions as they only receive inorganic erosional inputs through atmospheric deposition and they contain very low background levels of mineral matter. The correlation between geochemical and pollen analytical reconstructions of past human activity from three raised bog sites in Great Britain and Ireland is discussed here, with reference to examples from four particular time periods: the mid-to-late Bronze Age/Iron Age, the late Iron Age/Roman period, the Middle Ages/Tudor period and the more recent past. The results generally indicate a close correlation between the palynological and geochemical proxies, with the combination of both methods allowing a more comprehensive interpretation of the palaeoenvironmental record. Plantago lanceolata and Poaceae pollen frequencies appear to correlate particularly well with the geochemical proxies. A multi-proxy approach such as this may be particularly useful for identifying and interpreting low-level prehistoric human impact...|$|R
