50|$|In this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator,</b> boiling {{takes place}} inside the tubes, due to heating made (usually by steam) outside the same. Submergence is {{therefore}} not desired; the creation of water vapor bubbles inside the tube creates an ascensional flow enhancing the heat transfer coefficient. This <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator</b> is therefore quite efficient, the disadvantage being {{to be prone to}} quick scaling of the internal surface of the tubes. This design is then usually applied to clear, non-salting solutions.Tubes are usually quite long, typically 4 m. Sometimes a small recycle is provided. Sizing this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator</b> is usually a delicate task, since it requires a precise evaluation of the actual level of the process liquor inside the tubes. Recent applications tend to favor the falling-film pattern rather than rising-film.|$|R

The uniform {{distribution of the}} solution is important when using this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator.</b> The solution enters and gains velocity as it flows downward. This gain in velocity is attributed to the vapor being evolved against the heating medium, which flows downward as well. This evaporator is usually applied to highly viscous solutions, so it is frequently used in the chemical,sugar, food, and fermentation industries.|$|R

50|$|Climbing and falling-film plate {{evaporators}} have {{a relatively}} large surface area. The plates are usually corrugated and are supported by frame. During evaporation, steam flows through the channels formed by the free spaces between the plates. The steam alternately climbs and falls parallel to the concentrated liquid. The steam follows a co-current, counter-current path {{in relation to the}} liquid. The concentrate and the vapor are both fed into the separation stage where the vapor is sent to a condenser. This <b>type</b> of plate <b>evaporator</b> is frequently applied in the dairy and fermentation industries since they have spatial flexibility. A negative point of this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator</b> is that it is limited in its ability to treat viscous or solid-containing products. There are other <b>types</b> of plate <b>evaporators,</b> which work with only climbing film.|$|R

This is accentuated {{by the fact that}} the components, which consist of a shell and tubes, are easily obtainable with customized designs making them cost effective for construction and ideal for simple evaporation requirements. Moreover, this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator</b> also can easily contain those widely available vapour separators for foaming products.|$|R

40|$|The sugar {{industries}} {{are one of}} the major food industries in all countries in terms of demand, capacity and consumption. According to the Ethiopian country’s statistical report, the demand of sugar is tremendously increasing. To meet the demand and the requirements of sugar, many sugar {{industries are}} established. The existing sugar industries are operating with high steam consumption and less production capacity. The major cost and energy loss in the sugar industries are the consumption of steam. The main challenging objective in the sugar industry is to reduce the steam consumption. Most of the sugar industries in Ethiopia are using rising film calendria <b>type</b> multiple effect <b>evaporators</b> (Robert’s <b>type</b> <b>evaporator)</b> which are simple, robust, and easy to operate but are susceptible to scaling and require periodic cleaning. The scaling highly reduces the heat transfer, which make the multi effect evaporator to consume more amount of steam. This research work suggests that the rising film multi effect evaporator can be replaced by some radial <b>type</b> multi effect <b>evaporator,</b> which can eliminate the disadvantaged caused by the rising film evaporator. This replacement modification can reduce the steam consumption in the process. The design modifications are done for the large capacity of 4000 TCD (tones cane per day).

50|$|There are {{two major}} SPI <b>flash</b> <b>types.</b> The first type is {{characterized}} by small pages and one or more internal SRAM page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer, partially modified, and then written back (for example, the Atmel AT45 DataFlash or the Micron Technology Page Erase NOR <b>Flash).</b> The second <b>type</b> has larger sectors. The smallest sectors typically found in an SPI flash are 4 kB, {{but they can be}} as large as 64 kB. Since the SPI flash lacks an internal SRAM buffer, the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back, making it slow to manage.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, the refrigeration industry {{is facing the}} challenge of developing more efficient and environmental friendly refrigerators. Environmentally harmful refrigerants, CFC's and HCFC's, have already been shifted toward environmental friendly refrigerants such as HFC's and hydro carbons. However HFC's have a significant global warming potential. Accordingly, new policies have taken effect which are forcing the refrigerator industry to develop refrigerators that will reduce energy consumption and refrigerant emissions to reduce energy bills and the global warming effects of refrigerators. This study presents the research conducted on the condenser improvement {{of one of the}} commercially available household refrigerators and designing and applying a so-called Alternating evaporator duty cycle (AED) with a two step capacity modulated compressor. In the condenser improvement study, a household refrigerator's condenser configuration was changed from the cross-flow configuration to the counter-flow configuration without changing other components and cabinet structure. Ten experiments for different refrigerant charges were conducted and it was experimentally proved that the refrigerator with counter flow condenser consumes 1 % less energy compared to the one with cross-flow condenser. To study the potential of the AED cycle, a side-by-side household refrigerator equipped with a conventional cycle was converted into the AED cycle. First of all, the performance of the refrigerator with the new cycle was simulated and then cycle components were designed. Two different kinds of evaporators were used for food (R) cabinet such as forced convection fin-and-tube <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (FCE) and natural convection tube-and-plate <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (NCE), to investigate the humidity control improvement. Experimental results shows that, average humidity ratios of freezer (F) and R compartments during the cyclic operations are 0. 5 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air) and 2. 5 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air), respectively using the FCE and 0. 6 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air) and 2. 4 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air), respectively with NCE. Therefore, the humidity ratio of R compartment is maintained at 4 - 5 times higher level than that of F compartment for the AED cycle, and also 4 - 5 times higher than that R and F compartments for the base cycle. In addition to the better humidity control, AED cycle provides separate and more efficient cabinet temperature control...|$|R

40|$|In falling film {{evaporation}} process {{the heat is}} transferred from the condensing fluid to the liquid flowing over it. Falling film <b>types</b> of <b>evaporators</b> are widely used in refrigeration, desalination, petroleum refining, chemical industries, etc. Compared to flooded <b>type</b> <b>evaporators,</b> falling film evaporators need less amount of refrigerant and will give higher heat transfer rates even at lower heat fluxes. Tube geometry and tube size {{have an important role}} on the performance of the falling film evaporators. Geometry of the tube can be varied by heat transfer enhancing techniques and also by changing the shape of the tube. Thermal spray metal coating is a heat transfer enhancement technique which is done by spraying molten metal on any heat transfer surface. Vertical plate with sinusoidal corrugation is a surface enhancement technique which can be cheaper, compact and lighter for falling film evaporation compared to shell and tube configuration. This paper presents a two dimensional CFD study of water falling film evaporation on a thermal spray metal coated vertical corrugated conduits. Two-phase flow simulation is done by using a finite volume method based commercial software, with turbulence modeling which is done by k-Â two equations with shear stress transport (SST). Sinusoidal corrugations with different porosity have been selected for the study. Evaporation and heat transfer during falling film evaporation are included through user defined functions (UDFs). Effect of Reynolds number (Re), wall superheat and surface roughness on heat transfer coefficient is presented. Surface roughness is varied from 0. 33 to 4. 73. Re is varied from 500 to 2000 for two Prandtl numbers 2. 9 and 3. 4. Wall super heat is varied from 2 K to 10 K.
