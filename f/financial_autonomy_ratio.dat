Almost all economists involved in the subject agree that the present system needs a comprehensive reform, as it does efficiently allows to deal with the new reality of the enlarged European Union.

In general some economists postulate to extend the EU tax base by the creation of one or more new EU taxes whereas others opt for simplifying the system by replacing traditional and VAT resources with the so called ”fourth resource”.

40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{financial}} activities of medieval Jewish women in Italy and the Mediterranean. Contrary to Jewish legal tradition, which curtailed women’s <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy,</b> by the later Middle Ages {{communities across the}} region increasingly allowed women to manage their own dotal property, inherit property {{from a variety of}} sources, and engage in loan banking. An examination of the historical developments of some Jewish communities in Egypt, Spain, and central Italy suggests that this only occurred in times of communal crisis. Because all Jewish communities in the Middle Ages owed their respective governments a fiscal contribution or faced expulsion, money needed to be controlled by competent managers. In times of crisis, this could include women. Thus, in times of Mediterranean convivencia, Jewish communities flourished and followed their own laws, including prohibitions against female <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> This article argues that in times of disintegrating Mediterranean convivencia, however, Jewish women were able to actively contribute to the welfare of their community via their <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Local {{autonomy}} is a rarely explored {{concept in}} the literature, still holding an increasing {{importance in the}} current context of Romania’s development in the European Union. In this paper we attempt to provide an overall survey on the financial dimension of local autonomy, assuming that local autonomy cannot be implemented, unless local authorities have adequate financial resources. In this study we also analyze the possibility to measure the local revenue autonomy and to identify the variables which represent the determinants of the local revenue autonomy. Using empirical evidence from Romanian counties, we analyze the regional distributions for own revenues and for the significant determinants of local revenue autonomy. By means of econometric modeling we will highlight the variables which are statistically significant and explain the variation of the local revenues of Romanian counties, {{as well as the}} order of importance of the determinants of local <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The empirical results show us that, although, theoretically, the counties have a great administrative and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy,</b> practically this autonomy is very reduced (an average of under 40 % for local revenue). The modeling results show that the degree of local <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy</b> can be increased by increasing economic development, urbanization, the average living area per person and fertility. Unemployment and a high level of demographic dependency contribute to the decrease of local <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> </p...|$|R
