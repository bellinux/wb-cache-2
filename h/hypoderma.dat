25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and {{underlying}} tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids. Larval <b>Hypoderma</b> warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep.

There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of <b>Hypoderma</b> iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E

Thirty cattle sourced from herds {{with a history of}} <b>Hypoderma</b> infestation were included in each study. Cattle were formed into replicates of three animals each on the basis of pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titers. Within replicates each animal was randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight, administered once on Day 0; Eprinomectin 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once on Day 0 (when larvae were expected to be first instars); or Eprinomectin 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once when larvae were second or third instars (study dependent, Day 73, 119, or 140).

40|$|Larvae {{belonging}} to five species of <b>Hypoderma</b> spp. (Diptera, Oestridae) cause myiasis in wild and domestic ruminants that {{is characterized by}} migrations within deep tissues. In China hypodermosis {{is one of the}} most important arthropod diseases affecting ruminants and, moreover, represents a significant zoonosis, with numerous reports of <b>Hypoderma</b> spp. affecting farmers. Recently, a sixth species, <b>Hypoderma</b> sinense Pleske, has been rediscovered but the endogenous migration pathway within the host body is completely unknown and it represents a major constraint for the control of larval infection. In December 2003 a total of 165 larval stages of <b>Hypoderma</b> spp. were collected from different anatomical sites of 40 yaks slaughtered at an abattoir in the province of Gansu, China. The morphological characters and size of the recovered larvae were used to infer migratory routes and 45 specimens were also subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of cox 1 mtDNA and amplicons sequenced. All the larvae molecularly processed were identified as H. sinense and sequence identity was confirmed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) tool carried out using BfaI and HinfI endonucleases. The finding of H. sinense larvae only in the oesophagus or both in oesophagus and subcutaneous tissue of 12 and 15 animals, respectively, indicates that H. sinense larvae migrate through the oesophagus similarly to <b>Hypoderma</b> lineatum (De Villers).

40|$|Background: The studies {{reported}} here {{were conducted to}} assess the efficacy of ivermectin long-acting injection (IVM LAI; IVOMEC® GOLD, Merial; 3. 15 % w/v ivermectin) for the treatment and control of natural infestations of cattle by <b>Hypoderma</b> bovis and <b>Hypoderma</b> lineatum, which are the most economically important oestrid flies of cattle in the northern hemisphere. Methods: Cattle selected from herds {{with a history of}} <b>Hypoderma</b> infestation were grouped into blocks of three (Italy, 33 cattle; Germany, 30 cattle) or two (USA, 16 cattle) animals each, on the basis of positivity at the pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titres. Within each block, animals were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment regimens: saline (control); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of first-instar larvae (Italy, Germany, USA); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of second- and/or third-instar larvae (Italy, Germany). All treatments were administered by subcutaneous injection in correspondence of the area anterior to the shoulder at 1 ml/ 50 kg body weight, which corresponds to 630 mcg IVM/kg for IVM LAI. Results: No <b>Hypoderma</b> larvae emerged from animals treated with IVM LAI, whereas live H. lineatum (Italy) or H. bovis (Germany, USA) larvae were collected from saline-treated animals (P < 0. 01). No adverse reactions to treatments were in any of the animals enrolled in the study. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate that ivermectin in a long-acting formulation is 100 % efficacious in the treatment of cattle naturally infested by H. bovis and H. lineatum larvae at all stages of development. IVM LAI can, therefore, be used as 'prophylactic' treatment for <b>Hypoderma</b> spp. infestations in absence of external evidence of their presence and thus prior to skin and carcass damage, and as 'therapeutic' treatment, when warbles are already present...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the species}} of <b>Hypoderma</b> (Diptera: Oestridae) {{that have been}} {{described}} and named {{over the last three}} centuries, <b>Hypoderma</b> sinense Pleske {{has been the subject of}} several scientific discussions. <b>Hypoderma</b> sinense was described by T. Pleske in 1926 on the basis of only three females collected by the Russian explorer P. K. Kozlov nearly 25 years earlier during a scientific expedition to China (1900 - 1901). This species was examined by the foremost oestrid authorities and synonomized with H. lineatum. Recently a unique, unidentified species of <b>Hypoderma</b> was observed to infect cattle and yaks in China. Molecular and morphological observations confirmed the unique nature of the third-stage larvae. This data initiated a debate within the scientific community regarding the proper name of this species, in particular with reference to previous taxonomical discussion on the validity of H. sinense. The present work provides a historical overview of the Russian scientific expeditions that collected the specimens and of the explorers and the entomologists who contributed to the description of H. sinense. The morphological examination of the original type material of H. sinense and the comparison with females of H. lineatum indicated that the H. sinense lectotype, deposited at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg, was within the range of variation of H. lineatum. Comparisons of the cox 1 (688 bp) sequence obtained from the leg of a paralectotype of H. sinense with those of H. bovis (Linneaus), H. lineatum (De Villers) and of a sixth valid species of <b>Hypoderma</b> identified as "H. sinense" available in GenBank revealed differences of 9. 7 %, 7. 2 % and 0. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Migrating first-instar larvae of <b>Hypoderma</b> Zineatum are a {{frequent}} cause of focal inflammatory lesions in connective tissues of the mediastinum, parietal and visceral pleura, peritoneum, lungs, diaphragm, and other loci. The lesions are characterized grossly by foci of yellowish or greenish gelatinous edema and microscopically by infiltration of the edematous tissue by a dense array of eosinophils. Lesions were recognized {{during a period}} of several weeks in late spring; the timing was attributable to events in the life cycle of the fly. The larvae, which were small (≈ 1 x 4. 5 mm), transparent, and unobtrusive, were recovered from lesions in 12 of 20 cattle in which careful parasitologic examination was made.
