50|$|Compressor Products International designs, {{manufactures}} {{and services}} components for reciprocating compressors and engines. These components include packing and wiper assemblies and rings, piston and rider rings, compressor valve assemblies, <b>divider</b> <b>block</b> valves, compressor monitoring systems, lubrication systems and related components. Its products are mainly {{used in the}} refining, petrochemical, natural gas and general industrial markets.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>divider</b> <b>block</b> {{architecture}} using pre-computed values. At the first stage, the input is scaled {{so that the}} denominator, D, has value between 0. 5 and 1. Then the block takes a pre-computed value corresponding to 1 /D and multiplies it with the nominator. In order to save utilized memory bits, we take only several bits from D. In the end, we compare synthesis result of our <b>divider</b> <b>block</b> with several <b>divider</b> <b>block</b> implementations. The result shows that our <b>divider</b> <b>block</b> gives the smallest total logic elements and the shortest latency among the compared blocks...|$|E
50|$|The mall changed {{owners in}} 1997, {{purchased}} by Salisbury Mall Associates, LLC of Baltimore, Maryland. The new owners closed the original west {{wing of the}} mall {{in the spring of}} 1998 by erecting a plywood <b>divider</b> to <b>block</b> it off from the eastern wing. The western wing was allowed to quickly deteriorate. Because of the mall's flat roof, leaks were often a problem, and the original west wing was now going without the most basic of upkeep and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|A {{real time}} radar signal {{clustering}} problem is resolved by a dedicated hardware {{implementation of the}} Fuzzy ART neural network. This novel architecture implements a reformulated algorithm for high speed clustering. The proposed dedicated digital VLSI system is composed of cascadable integrated circuits, each one containing several neural processors, comparators, a <b>divider</b> and <b>blocks</b> of RAM. This efficient solution was designed and will be implemented in the near future. The basic component requires 74 K gates and occupies an area of 52 : 5 mm 2 in a 0. 8 ¯m BICMOS technology. Each chip process an input pattern for 32 neurons every 2 ¯s. 1. INTRODUCTION On line clustering for data reduction consists of grouping {{an unknown number of}} source categories. This work was driven by one such application, where incoming radar pulses may arise at the rate of 10 6 pulses per second, and where clustering them before the main processing would significantly reduce system complexity. The solution propose [...] ...|$|R
