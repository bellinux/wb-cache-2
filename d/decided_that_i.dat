5|$|During March 1945, Wells {{acted as}} one of the eight pallbearers for Major General George Alan Vasey at the latter's funeral. Vasey had been killed in a plane crash just off the coast of Cairns, while en route to assume command of the 6th Division in New Guinea. That same month, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Corps would lead an assault against the island of Borneo. As a consequence, {{headquarters}} of I Corps moved to Morotai, where it opened on 24 April. The initial Borneo landings took place on 1 May, with the Australian force in action at Tarakan. Over the proceeding engagements, Wells assisted in the organisation and implementation of the operations in Borneo. As the war drew to a close in September 1945, Wells returned to Australia and was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne.|$|E
500|$|On June 2, 2016, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Lansbury {{would return to}} Broadway in the 2017–18 season in a revival of Enid Bagnold's 1955 play The Chalk Garden. The play will be produced by Scott Rudin at a theatre to-be-announced. However, in an interview published on September 20, 2016, Lansbury stated that {{she will not be}} performing in The Chalk Garden, stating, in part: [...] "At my time of life, I've <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to be with family more and being alone in New York doing a play requires an extraordinary amount of time left alone." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About {{five years ago}} I decided I wanted to write this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day. [...] I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because I get so much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jefferies gave {{evidence}} to the Leveson Inquiry, established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the News of the World phone hacking affair. [...] Jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had [...] "besieged" [...] him after he was questioned by the police; he said: [...] "It {{was clear that the}} tabloid press had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was guilty of Miss Yeates' murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt. They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue." [...] Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012, the Daily Mirror editor, Richard Wallace, described the newspaper's coverage of Jefferies' arrest as a [...] "black mark" [...] on his editing record.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression {{he had something to}} hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E

500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to get back}} to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E

500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, Carswell quit UKIP {{to become}} an {{independent}} MP for Clacton, leaving UKIP with no MPs in parliament.

2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies {{because that was the}} one thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation for me to see three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|In April 1954, Scott {{attended}} the Cannes Film Festival, where she posed wading barefoot in a fountain and surf for photographers. Though {{she left for}} London immediately after the festival, her visit to France had unforeseen consequences. Later that month, {{it was announced that}} she would be the host of High Adventure (1957–1958), a travelogue television series for CBS, but she never appeared in it. As Scott put it: [...] "...out of the clear blue sky one morning, I woke and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never wanted to make another film again. It was just a spark, I can't explain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Pauline Kael, in {{her famous}} New Yorker review, wrote [...] "The movie {{breakthrough}} has finally come. Bertolucci and Brando {{have altered the}} face of an art form." [...] Brando confessed in his autobiography, [...] "To this day I can't say what Last Tango in Paris was about," [...] and added the film [...] "required me {{to do a lot of}} emotional arm wrestling with myself, and when it was finished, I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie. I felt I had violated my innermost self and I didn't want to suffer like that anymore... You can't fake it." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has been}} a great source of {{inspiration}} for Michael Stipe of R.E.M. Listening to her album Horses when he was 15 made a huge impact on him; he said later, [...] "I <b>decided</b> then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to start a band." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} he say?" [...] And then, in the {{presence}} of Violet, Phineas gave the message. He thought it better that it should be given; and were he to decline to deliver it now, it would never be given. [...] "Whether there be law in the land to protect me or whether there be none, I will never live with him," [...] said Lady Laura. [...] "Is a woman like a head of cattle, that she can be fastened in her crib by force? I will never live with him though all the judges of the land should <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must do so." ...|$|R

2500|$|Rakoff {{said that}} his first career choice was to be an actor: he wrote, [...] "like generations of other misfits before me, be they morphological, sexual or otherwise, I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would make theatre my refuge". Rakoff {{performed}} in the theatre at university and acted while working full-time in the publishing industry and later while freelancing as a writer. For instance, he performed at the first US Comedy Arts Festival in 1995 in a play written by a friend. [...] He {{has said that he}} likes acting because it involves other people, unlike writing. However, his self-assessment of his acting ability was [...] "as it turns out, I'm a deeply uncompelling camera presence".|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report {{reported}} that Oprah staffers were [...] "sharply {{divided on the}} merits of booking Sarah Palin". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, [...] "The item in today’s Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates." [...] Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on Larry King Live in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.|$|E
2500|$|On May 19, 1936, Abe went {{shopping}} {{and saw a}} movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Omiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide {{one week after the}} murder, and practiced necrophilia. [...] "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E
5000|$|After graduating {{high school}} in 2000, he {{attended}} California State University, Fullerton, but left after five weeks to move to Los Angeles: [...] "I just <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> what <b>I</b> {{really wanted to do}} was try to work in the real entertainment world. Life is all about taking risks to get what you want." ...|$|R
5000|$|Actor Mark Little {{joined the}} cast of Neighbours in 1988. He took up the offer to play Joe Mangel, after being black listed from various work {{opportunities}} due to his strong ties to the union and the [...] "overtly political nature" [...] of his solo theatre shows. The role was originally intended to last for three months. Of how he approached the part, Little wrote [...] "I committed myself to the task. And I made the idea more palatable by <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would treat it as a pop art experiment, after all, no one was watching. Little did <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be dabbling with similar themes as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Like Dr. Frankenstein, I was about to create a pop monster. The wild man, Joe Mangel." [...] Little's contract was later extended.|$|R

"I {{have not}} quite {{determined}} on my next move, {{and it is}} not improbable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall go down in this ship and establish myself, for a time, at Martaban; and open a trade in Tenasserim.
