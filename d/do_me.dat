25|$|In Sir Walter Scott's 'Heart Of Midlothian' {{he has the}} Duke of Argyll saying ``the Dunlop is {{the very}} cheese of which I am so fond, and I will take it as the {{greatest}} favour you can <b>do</b> <b>me</b> to send one to Caroline Park.

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can <b>do</b> <b>me</b> wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

The song enjoyed a revival in 1954 after Bill Krenz's recording.|$|E

500|$|Ray of Light {{continued}} to influence mainstream music when British singer and songwriter, Adele, {{stated that the}} album {{was one of the}} main sources of inspiration for her third studio album, 25 (2015). Particularly, [...] "Frozen" [...] was a source of inspiration as well, admitting that the track gave her [...] "confidence to come and <b>do</b> <b>me</b> again".

Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|A peasant {{told the}} social activist Danilo Dolci in the 1950s how the {{situation}} was in Villalba after the Americans had landed: the Mafia [...] "robbed the storehouses of the agrarian Co-op and the army’s storehouses; sold food, clothes, cars and lorries in Palermo on the black market. In Villalba all power was in their hands: church, Mafia, agricultural banks, latifundia, all {{in the hands of}} the same family … One used to go and see him and ask 'Can you <b>do</b> <b>me</b> this favour?' even for a little affair one had with some other person."' ...|$|E

500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... I feel I have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ...

500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going to <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a lot more personal good than the movies ever have... The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo."

500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't <b>do,</b> <b>me</b> boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get {{any one of us}} out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E
500|$|On September 6, General Clinton wrote {{a letter}} to Cornwallis, telling him to expect reinforcements.

[...] Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis [...] "dangling in the wind." [...] One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help: [...] "I am of the opinion that you can <b>do</b> <b>me</b> no effectual service but by coming directly to this place." [...] Before dispatching the letter on the 17th, Cornwallis added, [...] "If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must prepare to hear the worst".|$|E
