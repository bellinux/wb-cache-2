25|$|A {{consistent}} {{theory that}} has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to <b>be</b> <b>essentially</b> undecidable. In fact, every consistent extension will <b>be</b> <b>essentially</b> undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. Robinson arithmetic is known to <b>be</b> <b>essentially</b> undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic <b>is</b> also (<b>essentially)</b> undecidable.|$|R

5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|Route 139 <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> three distinct, but {{connected}} highways: {{the upper}} level, the lower level, and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate78 concurrency). NJDOT officially charts the lower and upper levels as independent highways, {{with the lower}} level considered Route139 with a notation that the highway then coincides with I-78, and the upper level considered Route139U.|$|E

Since secondary resources have exceedingly low discovery costs and very low production costs, they may have displaced {{a significant portion of}} primary production.

While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> the same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system, engine nacelle alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E

(A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> {{the displacement of}} a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

In other words, we have no idea of what reductivism really amounts to.|$|R
