5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E

5|$|In {{his sophomore}} year, Fernández {{was moved to}} {{shooting}} guard in the Temple starting lineup, a change that felt strange for <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> used to playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game.

On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As {{a result of his}} performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half. He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, had to step back to executive producer, as he was overcommitted producing Kudos crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton wrote the first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards wrote the fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
