500|$|A {{writer from}} the website E! Online felt {{that in the}} video, Beyoncé [...] "most {{certainly}} comes into her own". Puja Patel of Spin regarded it as [...] "practically a tribute to her curves". An editor for CTV News noted how the singer was seen hovering over a bed in an exorcist style. Kathy Iandoli from Vice remarked the same particular scenes for showing Beyoncé living in a matrix. Billie Cohen from the magazine Condé Nast Traveler noted that [...] "maybe {{one of the most}} memorable image" [...] from the visual album was when the singer was seen falling on a <b>king-size</b> <b>bed</b> in [...] "Rocket". In what she perceived to be the best dance moves on the album, Lindsey Weber of Vulture listed the same scene. Considering it one of the most intimate videos on the entire record, Michael Zelenko from The Fader noted, [...] "In a collection full of erotic videos, 'Rocket,' with its heaving chests, bare thighs, bubble baths, and nails clawing at sheets, manages to stand apart as the steamiest of the bunch." [...] Jody Rosen of The New York Times opined that the video featured mostly slow-motion pictures of [...] "billowing silk sheets and water droplets tumbling onto Beyoncé's bare midriff". Neil McCormik from The Daily Telegraph noted the lack of subtlety during the scenes showing a power drill and Beyoncé [...] "shuddering with pleasure". In another review, he labeled the clip as [...] "very naughty".|$|E

Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single child or adult, to large queen and <b>king-size</b> <b>beds</b> designed for two adults.

Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot.

The Superior Double rooms measure 27 square feet, each with a unique design and an abundance of world antiques.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson {{is buried}} in Omaha's Prospect Hill Cemetery next to Dan Allen.

50|$|The {{stage was}} of unseen {{proportions}} for an outdoor concert, {{consisting of a}} circular array lighting rig spanning 100 ft atop a stage spanning 360 ft.

5000|$|Unfamiliar {{with the}} area, the trio got lost {{on their first}} day of recording, {{arriving}} at the studio three hours late. Blink got to work immediately, setting up Raynor's drums and beginning to lay down tracks. [...] "We were working ten- to twelve-hours straight, hardly even breaking for food or anything," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2001. The band made reservations at local hotel {{not far from the}} studio for a room with two double beds. Despite the request, the band were stuck with one <b>king-size</b> <b>bed,</b> with the three musicians sleeping three-across in one bed. DeLonge recorded through Bad Religion guitarist Gurewitz's amp, and also accidentally broke his microphones. Ten Foot Pole member Steve Kravac was the engineer for the album, and the trio made an immediate impression on him with their humor and eagerness. Kravac set the trio up and recorded most of Cheshire Cat live, and there were few retakes, which would lead to the record's raw appeal.|$|E

40|$|Nadia {{woke up to}} {{the loud}} banging of the front door. It sounded as if someone was desperate to get into the house. Glancing at the clock on her bedside table, the time read 2 : 00 am. ‘Who could that {{possibly}} be at this hour?’ she thought to herself. Then she noticed the empty space {{on the other side of}} the <b>king-size</b> <b>bed.</b> Realisation hit her. It was probably Tyrone, back from one of his drinking sprees and too drunk to let himself in with his keys. ‘Piece of shit,’ she murmured under her breath. She quickly donned her robe and responded with quick steps towards the door. By then Tyrone was agitated by her slowness in opening the door. He started bellowing at the top of his lungs...|$|E
