40|$|Abstract Background <b>Diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> and ocular {{melanoma}} {{are both}} rare tumors. To {{the best of}} our knowledge there is only one previous report of three cases in a family with known susceptibility to malignancies associating <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> and ocular melanoma, with no sporadic cases previously reported. Case presentation We describe the case of a 59 -year-old man with a history of <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma,</b> who presented with ocular melanoma 41 months after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We also briefly review the literature. Conclusions <b>Diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> is an uncommon but aggressive disease. As <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> characteristically remains confined to the abdominal cavity, any new extra-abdominal symptom should eventually raise suspicion of another primary tumor. Few cases of <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> peritoneal <b>mesothelioma</b> associated with other primary tumors have been reported. As ocular melanoma is also infrequent, we suspect a genetic predisposition to these tumors.

The tumoricidal effect was related to the mTHPC dose, light dose and the time interval between sensitation and activation. 0. 3 mg kg- 1 mTHPC activated after 48 h with 10 Joules cm- 2 of non-thermal laser light at 650 nm resulted in a 10 mm deep tumour infarction, due to tumour vessel necrosis and thrombosis. The mTHPC tissue concentration was up to 14 times higher in the tumour than in normal tissues. Skin photosensitivity was mild, dose dependent and occurred 3 to 10 days after administration of mTHPC. According to the results obtained, intraoperative mTHPC-PDT was performed following pleuropneumonectomy in two, pleurectomy and lobectomy in one and pleurectomy in one patient. Ten Joules cm- 2 were delivered to the diaphragm and the costophrenic sulcus and 5 Joules cm- 2 to the remaining thoracic cavity. The postoperative course was marked by loss of appetite, fluid retention, hypoproteinemia and severe chest pain. One patient succumbed from aspiration pneumonia.

40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>mesothelioma</b> is an {{aggressive}} tumor which displays a median survival of 11. 2  months and a 5 -year survival {{of less than}} 5 % emphasizing {{the need for more}} effective treatments. This study uses an orthotopic model of malignant mesothelioma established in syngeneic, immunocompetent C 57 Bl/ 6 mice which produce malignant ascites and solid tumors that accurately replicate the histopathology of the human disease. Host stromal and immune cell accumulation within malignant ascites and solid tumors was determined using immunofluorescent labeling with confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. An expression profile of cytokines and chemokines was produced using quantitative real-time PCR arrays. Tumor spheroids and solid tumors show progressive growth and infiltration with host stromal and immune cells including macrophages, endothelial cells, CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes, and a novel cell type, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The kinetics of host cell accumulation and inflammatory mediator expression within the tumor ascites divides tumor progression into two distinct phases. The first phase is characterized by progressive macrophage and T lymphocyte recruitment, with a cytokine profile consistent with regulatory T lymphocytes differentiation and suppression of T cell function. The second phase is characterized by decreased expression of macrophage chemotactic and T-cell regulating factors, an increase in MDSCs, and increased expression of several cytokines which stimulate differentiation of MDSCs. This cellular and expression profile suggests a mechanism by which host immune cells promote <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>mesothelioma</b> progression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{report a}} biphasic <b>malignant</b> <b>mesothelioma</b> in an aged female F 344 /DuCrlCrlj rat. Macroscopically, {{multiple}} pale brown nodules {{were observed in}} the abdominal cavity with retention of bloody ascites. Histopathologically, the tumor cells spread over the peritoneum and formed masses {{on the surface and}} underlying adipose tissues. The tumor cells dominantly proliferated in a solid, nodu-lar or nest-like pattern with modest amount of fibrillar connective tissues, which contained hyaluronan. The tumor consisted of ovoid, polygonal or spindle-shaped cells that possessed eosinophilic cytoplasms including glycogen; some tumor cells showed a signet-ring-like structure. Multinucleated cells and mitosis were found frequently, and direct invasion to intra-abdominal organs and intravascular metastasis to the liver were observed. Immunohistochemically, keratin and mesothelin were strongly positive in most of tumor cells, while vimentin was mainly positive in spindle-shaped cells. Podoplanin was also positive, particularly in the cell membrane of tumor cells. Electron microscopically, tumor cells showed an intercellular desmosome-like structure, basement membrane and microvillus.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{performed}} a retrospective {{review of the}} efficacy and morbidity of radical pleurectomy/decortication and intraoperative radiotherapy followed by external beam radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy for <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma.</b> Methods: A total of 32 patients with <b>diffuse</b> <b>malignant</b> pleural <b>mesothelioma</b> were initially evaluated between January 1995 and September 2000. Three patients were excluded from analysis because of unresectable disease. Two patients died postoperatively, and one patient had recurrent disease previously treated at an outside institution. Of the remaining 26 patients included in the analysis, 24 received intraoperative radiotherapy. External beam radiation therapy was generally started 1 to 2 months after resection and delivered by means of 3 -dimensional conformal radiation therapy or with inverse treatment planning intensity-modulated radiation therapy. When given, chemotherapy consisted of 2 to 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin initiated 1 to 2 months after completion of radiation. Results: At the time of data analysis, 5 of 26 patients were alive. The median follow-up was 9. 7 months (range, 2 - 67. 6 months). The median overall survival and progression-free interval {{from the time of}} the operation were 18. 1 and 12. 2 months, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and freedom from progression at 1 year were 64 % and 50 %, respectively. The site of failure was mostly locoregional.
