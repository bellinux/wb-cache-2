50|$|A {{range of}} {{anthropogenic}} led causes (e.g. boat collisions, dam construction) which also threaten freshwater cetaceans in other river systems, have {{been implicated in}} {{the decline of the}} baiji population. However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets (gill nets and <b>fyke</b> <b>nets)</b> and electrofishing; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji wasthe victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.|$|E

40|$|The {{invasive}} {{comb jelly}} Mnemiopsis leidyi is a lobate ctenophore native of coastal and estuarine {{waters of the}} temperate western Atlantic Ocean. In the last decades this species has expanded its range of distribution, colonizing marine and transitional environments in Europe. In October 2015, during a survey fishing the European eel Anguilla anguilla in Sardinia (western Mediterranean), a massive bloom of this specie was observed in the eutrophic S’Ena Arrubia Lagoon for the first time. In November 2015, sampling was conducted at three stations in the lagoon and in a <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> in order to estimate the abundance of M. leidyi and to determine {{its impact on the}} fishing activity. The results showed an abundance of 2. 83 ctenophores m- 3. Specimens were all adults, measuring 18 - 62 mm total length. The abundant number of ctenophores (6837 individuals per <b>fyke</b> <b>net)</b> damaged fishing operations, reducing catches and affecting the performance of fishing gears. Since there is no effective mechanical, chemical or biological method to counter M. leidyi, the short term economic damage may be approached by new management measures of fisheries.

The need for precise and accurate results that are cost effective is important so that we can achieve our conservation goals. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} explore Next-Generation - metabarcoding for the detection of feral and native freshwater fish species based on the DNA shed by individual organisms into the water column. Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) primers were developed for this study using DNA from six freshwater species expected to be found in the waterbody. These primers, along with 16 S rRNA (16 S) primers, were assessed to ensure that the molecular method was robust and suitable for use in the field. Along with the cost effectiveness of the molecular method when compared to the more traditional surveying method of <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying. This study comprised development of field and lab protocols for the detection of freshwater fish species in a lentic system. Both the COI and 16 S primer sets showed results that were comparable to previous <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveys, though both primer sets detected species that the other did not. Further qPCR analysis showed that there were differences in detection for both primers for each of the species. The molecular surveying of the waterbody has been proven sensitive enough to detect Maccullochella peelii. This species has a very low abundance in the waterbody (believed to be n= 1) so these results suggest that this method can be used to target low abundance species. The outcome of this study highlighted the need for multi-location sampling within a waterbody as increasing the number of locations sampled, led to an increase in the number of species detected. Along with the multi-location sampling, it was also important to sample throughout the year to account for seasonal variability. The eDNA study emphasized the importance of having knowledge of both the ecology and the biology of the species targeted so that a robust monitoring method can be implemented. As well as comparing the apparent accuracy of <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> and the eDNA approach in the study waterbody, a cost benefit analysis comparing the relative costs of multiplex DNA surveying, single species molecular surveying, and <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying was undertaken. Molecular environmental surveying was found to be a cost effective method for monitoring, as the analysis suggested single species monitoring would break even after only 95 waterbodies were surveyed, and multiplex surveying would break even after 145 waterbodies, under the proposed scenario. The cost benefit analysis explored the costs associated with all three methods, including lab set up costs, along with the number of waterbodies that could be surveyed on both a weekly and yearly basis...|$|R

We compared {{the efficiency of}} dip-netting to that of <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> in sampling the macroinvertebrate assemblage of a temporary pond in Don˜ ana National Park (SW Spain). We sampled the pond at four different times—morning, afternoon, evening and night—distinguishing between deep and shallow zones. In our sampling, dip-netting captured a higher number of taxa, and higher abundances of individuals than <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> However, both techniques captured exclusive taxa, not recorded with the other device. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> distinguished between nocturnal and diurnal macroinvertebrates, and hence are more appropriate to study macroinvertebrate diel activity.

Conversely, larvae of Sympetrum fonscolombei and Notonecta spp., and adults of Notonecta glauca were mainly diurnal. The overall diel activity pattern of the macroinvertebrate assemblage depended on the diel activities of their integrating taxa and stages. Although dip-netting was more appropriate to sample macroinvertebrate assemblages in different micro- habitats, <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> better captured nocturnal and fast- swimming invertebrates.

However, {{little is known}} about gear-specific biases for many common fish species because few multiple-gear comparison studies exist that have incorporated seasonal dynamics. We sampled six lakes and impoundments representing a diversity of trophic and physical conditions in Iowa, USA, using multiple gear types (i. e., standard modified <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> mini-modified <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> sinking experimental gill net, bag seine, benthic trawl, boat-mounted electrofisher used diurnally and nocturnally) to determine the influence of sampling methodology and season on fisheries assessments.

Mean catch per unit effort generally peaked in the spring and fall as a result of increased sampling effectiveness in shallow areas and seasonal changes in habitat use (e. g., movement offshore during summer). Mean proportional size distribution decreased from spring to fall for white bass Morone chrysops, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, suggesting selectivity for large and presumably sexually mature individuals in the spring and summer.

40|$|Sampling and {{assessment}} of nearshore fish communities is difficult due to {{the wide variety of}} habitats, substrates, and often complex structures. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, we conducted a comparison of ten different gear types, with the intent to develop a long-term sampling protocol of nearshore communities in Oneida Lake, NY. Gear types consisted of nine configurations of <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and one seine. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> varied by frame size (large vs. small), mesh size (large vs. small), orientation (parallel vs. perpendicular), and the inclusion/exclusion of wings.

Student?s t-test indicated significantly higher species richness and total catch during sampling period two. However, few significant differences were observed in any net-to-net comparisons using Tukey?s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Catches of key sport fishes, such as smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were significantly higher in smaller meshed nets. In order to maximize ease, efficiency and accuracy, we recommend assessments of nearshore communities take place in sampling period two, using a combination of perpendicularly set medium frame <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> with both large and small mesh sizes.

40|$|During {{the last}} two hundred years many {{wetlands}} and streams in Sweden have been lowered to provide land for agriculture and forestry. Some of the coastal wetlands and streams probably served as spawning sites for certain species of fish in the Baltic Sea, but the present situation is not well known. As standardized methods to monitor fish in running waters are carried out during late summer or autumn, {{there is a need}} for methods to sample spring-spawning fish in these streams. The aim of this study was to survey the lower kilometer stretch of Hammerstaån in Stockholm, to investigate the extent to which the stream is used by spring-spawning fish. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate a new type of survey fishing gill net called strömöversiktsnät (SÖN). This was done by comparing the catch of fish by SÖN with that of <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> The comparison of the types of gear included number of fish caught, on a catch per unit effort (CPUE) basis, number of species and the size distributions. The study included 14 days with one gill net and one fyke net at two sites, in total 28 net-days. The inventory yielded in total seventeen species among which only trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), burbot (Lota lota), eel (Anguilla anguilla) and pike (Esox lucius) were previously known to occur. Six spawning species, smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), vimba bream (Vimba vimba), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama) and white bream (Blicka bjoerkna) were caught in more than 60 individuals, which was set as a limit for comparisons of size distributions.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the survival, incidence and severity of injuries and physiological reactions to stress caused by boat electrofishing in comparison with standard netting techniques in three New Zealand native fish species. Shortfin eel (Anguilla australis), grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) and common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) were captured from the Waikato River and its surrounding lakes with standardised boat electrofishing techniques (60 -Hz pulsed direct current, 45 - 60 % of range with the 0 - 500 -V peak voltage machine setting, 3 - 4 Amps root mean square output). Fish were captured in water of 133 - 154 μScm─ 1 ambient conductivity at 18 - 21 oC. Capture techniques used for comparison were <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> for eels, gill netting for grey mullet and beach seine netting for smelt. Survival was assessed in eels that held for 30 days after capture and smelt that were held for 30 min after capture. Several different methods {{were used to assess}} the incidence and severity of injuries. External examinations were used to assess branding and abrasions, and internal injuries were assessed by radiographic imaging and bilateral filleting to reveal haemorrhaging and spinal damage. Finally, physiological stress was determined by an analysis of haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration and an analysis of blood plasma ions (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium). Survival over 30 days of shortfin eels captured by electrofishing (92 % for Lake Areare eels and 96 % for Lake Rotongaro eels) was similar to that for <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> (92 % for Lake Areare and 88 % for Lake Rotongaro). Two eels appeared to have died from fungal infections as no haemorrhaging or spinal injuries were apparent among the mortalities. External examinations revealed that no abrasions or branding occurred in eels captured by electrofishing; however, abrasions occurred in eels captured by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> (24 % for Lake Areare eels and 16 % for Lake Rotongaro eels). Rates of internal haemorrhaging immediately after electrofishing were inconsistent (0 % in Lake Areare and 28 % in Lake Rotongaro); in Lake Rotongaro, this was significantly greater than those captured by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting,</b> in which only 8 % had haemorrhages. No haemorrhaging was observed in eels after 30 days from Lake Areare. Haemorrhages from electrofishing in our study appeared to heal within the 30 -day holding period, as the incidence of haemorrhaging in Rotongaro eels reduced from 28 % at capture to only 4 % after 30 days in captivity. Rates of spinal injury in eels captured by electrofishing was also variable (12 % in Lake Areare eels and 8 % in Lake Rotongaro eels), compared to the rate of spinal injury in eels captured by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> (0 % in Lake Areare eels and 4 % in Lake Rotongaro eels). The upper rate of haemorrhaging that we found for electrofishing in shortfin eels (28 %) was similar to injury rates for electrofished American eels (25 %), but our rates of spinal damage (8 - 12 %) were much lower than for American eels (60 %). In grey mullet, {{there was no significant difference}} (P > 0. 101) in the occurrence of haemorrhages or spinal injuries between the two capture methods. However, physiological stress from electrofishing caused a significantly (t = 2. 37, P = 0. 02) reduced sodium ion concentration (139. 38 ± 13. 24 mM) compared to that of gill netting (149. 06 ± 15. 58 mM). Electrofishing also caused a significantly (t = 4. 61, P < 0. 001) lower concentration of haemoglobin (86. 55 ± 9. 21 g L- 1) compared to that of grey mullet captured by gill netting (108. 81 ± 23. 86 g L- 1). However, there were no significant differences between capture methods for the other blood plasma constituents tested (haematocrit and the blood plasma ions sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium). Survival was high in smelt captured by both electrofishing (94. 8 %, n = 1217) and by seine netting (92. 9 %, n = 1271), with no statistically significant difference between the two fishing methods (t = − 1. 021, P = 0. 320). In a subsample of smelt analysed for injuries (n = 40 for each method), external injuries were observed in 15 % (n = 6) of smelt captured by electrofishing and in 20 % (n = 8) of smelt captured by seine netting. No haemorrhages were detected in smelt for either of the capture methods and there was no significant difference (G = 0. 215, P = 0. 642) in the rate of spinal injuries in smelt captured by electrofishing (10 %, n = 4) or by seine netting (5 %, n = 2). These results suggest that boat electrofishing as practiced in New Zealand is in the long term generally no more harmful to shortfin eels, grey mullet, and common smelt than other comparable capture sampling techniques. Exceptions to this conclusion were increased haemorrhaging in electrofished shortfin eels, from which they recovered within 30 days, and reduced sodium and haemoglobin concentrations in electrofished grey mullet, which are signs of physiological stress. All fishing methods examined caused some level of injury, stress, or mortality in the three species studied. <b>Netting</b> techniques (<b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> gill netting, and seine netting) that are commonly used will also cause harm and these techniques are currently used far more widely than boat electrofishing...|$|R

Many galaxiid species have nondiadromous life histories {{and the distribution of}} some of these consists of discrete lacustrine populations (McDowall 2000; Allen, Midgley & Allen 2002). As a result of restricted or fragmented distributions, along with other impacts (e. g. introduced fish species), many lacustrine galaxiid species are considered to be threatened; hence monitoring populations for conservation purposes is a common management practice. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> are known to be effective for capturing small-sized benthic or littoral fish in lakes (Fago 1998; Krueger & Hubert 1998), including galaxiids (Rowe & Chisnall 1997; Rowe, Konui & Christie 2002).

40|$|Intertidal {{migration}} is relatively well-studied in marine fish biology. Most studies focused on marine sandy beaches and rocky shores. Comparatively little work, however, {{has been done}} on the distribution and migration patterns of fishes on estuarine mudflats. The seasonal composition of an intertidal estuarine fish community was studied with directional <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> at different heights on the mudflat. These <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> each sampled an opposite direction and as such could be used to analyze the migration patterns of fishes on the mudflat. The fish assemblage was dominated by juveniles of Clupea harengus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Platichthys flesus and Solea solea. The composition of the intertidal fish community reflected the cyclicity of seasonal recruitment of species into the estuary. Analysis of the directional data of the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> showed that the flatfish species, flounder and sole, migrated actively onto the mudflat. In contrast, the distribution of herring and seabass in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> suggests that they were transported passively by the tidal currents. These (semi-) pelagic species can be considered opportunistic vagrants onto the mudflat. They might follow their migrating hyperbenthic and pelagic prey and may find a valuable supplement to their diet in the infauna that disperses into the water column. Because of the low predator abundance and high turbidity {{in this part of the}} Scheldt estuary, predation is probably not an important trigger for intertidal migration. Species didn’t show a clear zonation on the mudflat and, if observed, this was mainly the result of species-specific differences in mobility. The zonation of flatfishes tended to be affected by density-dependent processes. Whenfish densities were higher, relatively more flounder were caught on the upper shore. By doing so, they avoid competition for food or space with sole, which stays on the middle and lower reaches of the mudflat...|$|E
40|$|INBO {{researchers}} surveyed fish assemblages {{in several}} future flood control areas along the Zeeschelde estuary (Fig. 1, Table 1). Two survey periods were performed at 11 sites (117 surveys in toal). Fish assembvlages were assessed using electric fishing and <b>fyke</b> <b>netting.</b> Physical and chemical recordings {{showed that the}} 25 % of the sites had a too low oxygen concentration. Some sites had no fish. In total 25 fish species were recorded. In the text fish results are explained for each area. In genral bitterling, stone moroko, Prucian carp, three-spined stickleback, roach and pumpkinseed dominate in numbers. The results indicate {{the presence of a}} diverse fish assemblage of mainly eurytopic and limnophilic species in some sites...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} 1, 637 {{immature}} eels of length 28 to 91 em and age 5 to 26 years was collected in summer seasons from 1969 to 1973 by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting.</b> The growth rate {{was similar to}} that of eels in many other Irish lakes but the age at maturity in the eels of the main Shannon was several years more than in similar waters. The food was almost exclusively invertebrate. In the Fergus system lakes earlier maturity was noted and fish was the principal food of eels of over 50 cm. A preliminary study of eels migrating upstream at Parteen Weir in 1973, 15 km above the tidal boundary, showed that few, if any, elvers travelled that distance in their first year...|$|R
500|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} {{taken by a}} number of fishing methods, with the most common being seine <b>nets.</b> Ring, fence, <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> and beam trawling are also used occasionally, but more often associated with sampling the entire population for research purposes. [...] Research has focused on the effectiveness of different mesh sizes used to net the species in order to prevent juvenile individuals dying after becoming enmeshed. Associated research has also shown that those whiting that survive and are discarded tend to have much lower survival rates due to scale loss, which is a major issue, as many young fish are regularly taken in such nets and released by the fisherman after sustaining scale loss. These studies have led to a number of proposals and subsequent changes to net regulations.|$|R

40|$|Wild-caught wrasse {{is used as}} {{cleaner fish}} to reduce sea lice infestations in salmonid {{aquaculture}} in Norway. Wrasses are protected during the spawning period (May-July), but salmon farmers and fishermen have requested to conduct a fishery for ballan wrasse before the general opening date for all wrasse species. In this project we investigated whether selection grids covering {{the short end of}} pots and last ring in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> could effectively catch ballan wrasse with low by-catch of corkwing and goldsinny wrasse. Fourteen fishermen participated in an experimental fishery in June 2016. Pots with 25 mm gaps achieved an average catch consisting of 81 % ballan wrasse of the total catch of target wrasse species. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> were on average less effective and showed larger variation among fishermen. Surveys of the ballan wrasse spawning period should be conducted before such a fishery is being allowed to avoid disturbing the spawning...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe key {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the sampling efficiency of various fish sampling gears for a lentic ecosystem health assessment. A fish survey for the lentic ecosystem health assessment model was sampled twice from 30 reservoirs during 2008 – 2012. During the study, fishes of 81 species comprising 53, 792 individuals were sampled from 30 reservoirs. A comparison of sampling gears showed that casting nets were the best sampling gear with high species richness (69 species), whereas minnow traps were the worst gear with low richness (16 species). Fish sampling efficiency, based on the number of individual catch per unit effort, was best in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> (28, 028 individuals) and worst in minnow traps (352 individuals). When we compared trammel nets and kick nets versus <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and casting nets, the former were useful in terms of the number of fish individuals but not in terms of the number of fish species...|$|E
40|$|To {{contribute}} to mass balanced trophic model parametrization, estimates of annual food consumption/biomass ratio (Q/B) were compiled for 37 selected fish {{species of the}} Curuçá Estuary in Northern Brazil using an empirical model. Samples were taken bimonthly between July 2003 and July 2004 in the main channel and intertidal creeks using an otter trawl and a <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> respectively. The aspect ratio of the caudal fin varied between 0. 8 for Poecilia vivipara and 4. 6 for Sciades herzbergii and the Q/B ranged from 2. 3 for Epinephelus itajara to 67. 3 for Cetengraulis edentulus. This study represents the first reference available on Q/B values of 29 fish species. This compilation of Q/B ratio presented here should be useful for construction of Ecopath models particularly in tropical conditions.   Keywords: consumption/biomass; aspect ratio; trophic models; Ecopath.   DOI: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Lake Eber is a small, shallow tectonic lake, {{located in}} {{the central part of}} Anatolia. Lake is under effect of {{pollution}} and exotic fish species. In order to define environmental degradation within the lake and its effects on fish assembly in a historical perspective field study was conducted. Water sampling was conducted seasonally between December, 2012 and September, 2013. Physico-chemical paramaters as dissolved oxygen, pH, total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen was assessed. Trophic state index was calculated from phosphorus concentrations and trophic state of the lake was assessed. Fishing was carried out in April, 2013, on randomly selected eight stations with benthic multimesh nets (30 m long, 1. 5 m depth, 12 different mesh size from 5 x 5 mm to 55 x 55 mm) and <b>fyke</b> <b>net.</b> Fish assembly, catch data (catch per unit effort), length-weight relationships of the species with enough sample size is reported...|$|R
