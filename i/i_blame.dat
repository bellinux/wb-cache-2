500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?" ...|$|E

Stone was said to have slipped the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear open my veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How then could <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E

500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
500|$|Drawing from synth-pop music, [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{incorporates}} minimalist production elements. with styles commonly seen in {{new wave}} music. Distinguished as the [...] "poppiest" [...] track from Night Time, My Time, its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior {{contributes to the}} public image she is given by the media; during the chorus, she states [...] "I {{just want you to}} realize <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> myself for my reputation." [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] was assumed to have been inspired by the [...] "anthemic pop fizz" [...] from her breakthrough single [...] "Everything Is Embarrassing" [...] from her second extended play Ghost (2012). Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork Media implied that [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long-delayed debut studio album; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project, and added that it [...] "lays out the emotional core" [...] of her process. Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a [...] "socialite [...] Forever 21 model" [...] and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013, which she expected would highlight that her side projects [...] "have {{nothing to do with the}} kind of songs Ferreira writes these days". [...] "I Blame Myself", in addition to the tracks [...] "24 Hours" [...] and [...] "Love in Stereo", blend [...] "tenderized vocal hooks [...] chiming synth melodies", which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music. With his similar observation, Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the [...] "chiming synths" [...] that Martin recognized developed into the [...] "undeniably cathartic" [...] refrain.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] finished 25th in {{ratings for the}} week of October 22–28, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.7, equivalent to approximately 14.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the first two segments worked better than the third, [...] "but this is a marvelous episode, and set a high standard for the Halloween specials to come." [...] In 2008, Canwest News Service chose [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] {{as one of the}} top five scariest episodes from television's past. They singled out Marge saying [...] "This family has had its differences and we've squabbled, but we've never had knife fights before, and <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> this house" [...] as a memorable line from the episode. Two of the episode's segments were singled out by critics as exemplary parts of the Treehouse of Horror series. [...] "The Raven" [...] was selected as the second best Treehouse of Horror segment by Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad in 2005. Budke described the segment as [...] "one of the most refined Simpsons pop references ever" [...] and knows [...] "people that consider this the point that they realized The Simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent." [...] "Hungry are the Damned" [...] was selected as the fifth best Treehouse of Horror segment by Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN in 2008. The IGN reviewers singled out the How to Cook for Forty Humans section of the segment as its funniest moment.|$|E

2500|$|Production {{lasted a}} year and 39 episodes. [...] After this first series was over, one {{interviewer}} asked McGoohan {{if he would have}} liked the series to continue, to which he replied, [...] "Perhaps, {{but let me tell you}} this: I would rather do twenty TV series than go through what I went through under that Rank contract I signed a few years ago and for which <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> no one but myself." ...|$|E

[...] Figo did not receive further sanctions and was cleared {{to play in the}} subsequent quarter-final match against England as he had been shown the yellow card during the match.

2500|$|The {{brutality}} of the murders shocked the Israeli public, intensifying Israeli distrust of Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. Notably, the event also deeply damaged the Israeli left-wing's faith in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. Amoz Oz, the Israeli author and [...] "authoritative voice of Israel's peace camp," [...] stated, [...] "Without any doubt, <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> the Palestinian leadership. They clearly {{did not want to}} sign an agreement at Camp David. Maybe Arafat prefers to be Che Guevara than Fidel Castro. If he becomes the president of Palestine, he'll be the leader of a rough, Third World country and have to deal with sewage in Hebron, drugs in Gaza, and the corruption in his own government." ...|$|E

[...] Jamey Giddens said [...] "As much as I'm going to miss the tall, drink of DiMera, I can't say <b>I</b> <b>blame</b> Deidrick."
