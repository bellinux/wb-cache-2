5|$|A Washington Post-SurveyMonkey 50-state poll, {{conducted}} online between August 9 and September 1 found Gary Johnson polling at 10% or <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> 42 states, and at 15% or <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> 15 states (Johnson received 25% in {{his home}} state of New Mexico and 23% in Utah). Another poll conducted in mid-August by the Pew Research Center found Johnson supported by about 10% of registered voters. Of Johnson supporters, more than 60% identified as independent and more than 70% were younger than fifty years old. Johnson's supporters were evenly divided between men and women.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> protein, calcium, and energy than grasses.

They are also <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular were <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> the Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} school {{attendance}} rates in Africa. Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

5|$|Election Special was {{released}} by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records on August 16, 2012, one week before the 2012 Republican National Convention. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing a lost interest in both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect of releasing records.|$|E
5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
50|$|As {{he studied}} {{personality}} trends {{and stability in}} cultures, McCrae found that countries <b>high</b> <b>in</b> neuroticism and low in agreeableness form dimensions of uncertainty avoidance. Countries that are low <b>in</b> extraversion and <b>high</b> <b>in</b> conscientiousness tend to be <b>high</b> <b>in</b> power distance. Cultures <b>high</b> <b>in</b> extraversion predict {{a high rate of}} individualism. And, high levels of neuroticism and openness to experience indicate dimensions of masculinity within the culture.|$|R
