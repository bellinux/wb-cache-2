500|$|In March of {{the next}} year, Seara {{published}} an homage to journalist and ideologue Constantin Stere, noted for having brought back together the two factions of the PNR, and concluded: [...] "Mr. C. Stere, although involved in our country's partisan politics, [...] has transmitted to our quarrelsome brothers a peace message <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> proving that the foremost preoccupation of our minds is and will be national solidarity, the pure love for the holy cause of Romaniandom." [...] It later discussed the conflict between PNR politicians and Khuen-Héderváry's successor, László Lukács. In his reply to the PNR (paraphrased by Seara), Lukács equated the Romanians' political emancipation in Transylvania with militant irredentism, and prophesied that Transylvania was in real danger of being invaded by the Kingdom of Romania. Seara retorted by accusing Lukács of supporting [...] "preemptive" [...] Magyarization in [...] "the multilingual Kingdom of Hungary".|$|E

[...] (Anderson): [...] "It's not a very good occasion really, we have to hurry this because the lifeboat is standing by.
