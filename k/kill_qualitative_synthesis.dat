40|$|Context: In recent years, {{software}} researchers begun {{to benefit from}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> to systematically build knowledge about the impact and preconditions of software technologies. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> refers to <b>qualitative</b> research methods (as opposed to quantitative) used to bring together empirical evidence in a narrative or systematic review. However, only few of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>syntheses</b> published in software engineering have shown a rigorous approach to <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Thus, the current <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> findings are neither understandable nor trustworthy. Problem: These results indicate {{software researchers}} have difficulties in identifying quality issues in <b>qualitative</b> <b>syntheses</b> and in applying existing <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods. I found three problems that have hindered the use of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods in software engineering. First, the lack of consensus on the meaning on quality has impeded the definition of quality criteria and {{the design of a}} quality appraisal instrument. Second, it is unclear to what extent <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods are suitable for synthesizing evidence in software engineering. Finally, the lack of evidence on the suitability of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods has impeded their proper tailoring to software engineering needs and so, their effective use. Objectives: I aimed in this PhD thesis to design a reliable and valid quality appraisal instrument for qualitative synthesis; empirically evaluate the suitability of the most mature <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods, i. e., meta-ethnography and thematic analysis; and enhance existing guidelines for meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. Contributions: First, I developed an instrument to support software researchers in appraising the quality of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> using psychometric guidelines. I operationalized the notion of quality of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> into four criteria: inter-subject comprehensibility, indication of the research process, trustworthiness, and relevance. Then, I designed and validated the instrument. The results of two empirical studies indicate the instrument has acceptable inter-rater agreement, substantial inter-rater reliability, good criterion validity, and high acceptance. Second, I designed and performed a multiple-case study to characterize the suitability of meta-ethnography and thematic analysis in software engineering. Third, I tailored the current guidelines for performing meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. I specified a prescriptive process; formalize the identification, extraction, and integration of evidence; and formalize the notation used for documenting synthesis findings. Then, I designed and performed interviews to validate the proposed guidelines. The results indicates software researchers perceived the proposed guidelines as understandable, useful, and easy to use...|$|R

40|$|Context  Formal <b>{{qualitative}}</b> <b>synthesis</b> is {{the process}} of pooling qualitative and mixed-method research data, and then drawing conclusions regarding the collective meaning of the research. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> is regularly used within systematic reviews in the health professions literature, although such use has been heavily debated in the general literature. This controversy arises in part from the inherent tensions found when generalisations are derived from in-depth studies that are heavily context-dependent. Methods  We explore three representative <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methodologies: thematic analysis; meta-ethnography, and realist synthesis. These can be understood across two dimensions: integrative to interpretative, and idealist to realist. Three examples are used to illustrate the relative strengths and limitations of these approaches. Discussion  Against a backdrop of controversy and diverse methodologies, readers must take a critical stand when reading literature reviews that use <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> to derive their findings. We argue that notions of qualitative rigour such as transparency and acknowledgment of the researchers’ stance should be applied to <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{describes}} an approach {{for the use}} of a specific type of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> in the matrix approach, a mixed studies reviewing method. The matrix approach compares quantitative and qualitative data on the review level by juxtaposing concrete recommendations from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> against interventions in primary quantitative studies. However, types of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that are associated with theory building generate theoretical models instead of recommendations. Therefore, the output from these types of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> cannot directly be used for the matrix approach but requires transformation. This approach allows for the transformation of these types of output. Method: The approach enables the inference of moderation effects instead of direct effects from the theoretical model developed in a <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis.</b> Recommendations for practice are formulated on the basis of interactional relations inferred from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis.</b> In doing so, we apply the realist perspective to model variables from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> according to the context-mechanism-outcome configuration. Findings: A worked example shows {{that it is possible to}} identify recommendations from a theory-building <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> using the realist perspective. We created subsets of the interventions from primary quantitative studies based on whether they matched the recommendations or not and compared the weighted mean effect sizes of the subsets. The comparison shows a slight difference in effect sizes between the groups of studies. The study concludes that the approach enhances the applicability of the matrix approach. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> has the {{potential}} to contribute to theory building and to refine existing theories. This potential is currently underused because the synthesis methods need further development, in particular methods that extract evidence about relationships between concepts. This article addresses the adjustment of current <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods for theory building purposes. We use a five- step procedure that includes innovations: 1) Search and retrieval of relevant qualitative articles; 2) Rank the articles based on the richness of information to facilitate the progress of analysis; 3) Extraction of concepts and a newly developed method to determine relationships and draw path models for each separate article; 4) Synthesis of the separate path models into a theoretical model, and 5) Evaluation of the theoretical model, to answer the review question with, amongst others, the use of expert opinions and statistical testing of the model. The method is applied on the case of Triple P – Positive Parenting Program, in order to provide a practical example. The conclusion is that our innovated method for <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> enables theory building and theory refinement.

40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{a growing}} number of methods for synthesising {{qualitative}} research have emerged, particularly in relation to health-related research. There is a need for both researchers and commissioners to be able to distinguish between these methods and to select which method is the most appropriate to their situation. Discussion A number of methodological and conceptual links between these methods were identified and explored, while contrasting epistemological positions explained differences in approaches to issues such as quality assessment and extent of iteration. Methods broadly fall into 'realist' or 'idealist' epistemologies, which partly accounts for these differences. Summary Methods for <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> vary across a range of dimensions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{systematic}} literature review into the evolution and structure of internet-based ethnographic consumer research during the twenty-year period between 1996 and 2015. The results of a citation analysis and <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> are presented which demonstrate the limited engagement that marketing researchers have had with the discipline and the limited degree to which the discipline has influenced that literature. This hitherto lack of research presents a significant lacuna and a significant opportunity for marketing scholarship to engage further with that literature. Similarly, there are particular thematic areas where knowledge is currently lacking. Taken together, the citation analysis and <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> demonstrate that netnography is very much an emerging trend in the consumer research literature and there are many theoretical, empirical and practical bases upon which it may be applied, especially in the context of future studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} the {{contribution}} of qualitative evidence to the assessment of interventions has internationally been recognized, with an increasing amount of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> published {{and the development of}} methodologies of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> to respond to the growing interest.

40|$|Objectives In a <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis,</b> primary <b>qualitative</b> {{studies are}} {{integrated}} {{to develop a}} theory or evidence-based interventions. Until now, {{the strength of the}} evidence in the primary studies has not been taken into account in the outcome of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> In this paper, a method is developed and evaluated to assign weights to the findings of the qualitative studies using both the frequency {{and the quality of the}} reported results. Method Seventeen qualitative studies were retrieved in an illustrative example project on children and trauma. Findings were extracted from the primary studies with the use of coding which resulted in 14 themes. The quality of the studies was appraised using both expert judgement and a quality checklist. These outcomes are used to calculate the weights. Results When the outcomes of the checklist appraisal are compared with those of the expert judgement, the effect on the strength of the evidence is virtually always in the same direction. We found that as the frequency with which a concept is studied is low, the strength of the evidence oftentimes decreases even further when using the quality of the results in the weighing process. Conclusions In the end, the outcomes of a critical appraisal affect the weight that is placed on particular studies. The use of a checklist is recommended because of its more distinguishing ability. The method that was developed for assigning weights to the evidence is discussed in light of both the quality appraisal in qualitative research and the objectives of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

The aims {{of this study}} were: (1) to bring together <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that explore patients’ experience of living with chronic non-malignant pain and develop conceptual {{understanding of what it}} is like to live with chronic non-malignant pain for improved healthcare; (2) to undertake the first mega-ethnography of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> using the methods of meta-ethnography. Methods We used the seven stages of meta-ethnography refined for large studies. The innovation of mega-ethnography is to use conceptual findings from <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> as primary data. We searched 7 bibliographic databases from inception until February 2016 to identify <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that explored patients’ experience of living with chronic non-malignant pain. Results We identified 82 potential studies from 556 titles, screened 34 full text articles and included 11 <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> synthesising a total of 187 qualitative studies reporting more than 5000 international participants living with chronic pain. We abstracted concepts into 7 conceptual categories: (1) my life is impoverished and confined; (2) struggling against my body to be me; (3) the quest for the diagnostic ‘holy grail’; (4) lost personal credibility; (5) trying to keep up appearances; (6) need to be treated with dignity; and (7) deciding to end the quest for the grail is not easy. Each conceptual category was supported by at least 7 of the 11 <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses.</b> Conclusions This is the first mega-ethnography, or <b>synthesis</b> of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> using the methods of meta-ethnography. Findings help us to understand that the decision to end the quest for a diagnosis can leave patients feeling vulnerable and this may contribute to the adversarial nature of the clinical encounter.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the strategies used {{to deal with}} the clinical heterogeneity of interventions and multiple outcome measures used in Cochrane reviews on physiotherapy and occupational therapy. METHODS: A search for systematic reviews on physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the Cochrane Library was performed. Data on the method of categorization of interventions, on measures, and on the method of data synthesis were systematically extracted. RESULTS: 52 reviews were identified. In 22 (42 %) reviews only one index intervention was evaluated, in the other 30 reviews index interventions were categorized. A large diversity in the number and type of outcome measures was found (median 6. 5, range 1 - 23). In 48 % of the reviews one or more primary outcome measures were defined. In 52 % of the reviews no quantitative data synthesis was performed, whereas five different methods for <b>qualitative</b> data <b>synthesis</b> were applied in 11 reviews.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines and {{explores the}} assumptions and debates associated with <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> within the health sciences. My particular {{area of interest}} is the complexities arising from various techniques of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> currently emerging {{in the field of}} qualitative systematic review. More specifically, in this study I sought {{to assess the impact of}} the choice of theoretical constructs, methodological frameworks or methods on the nature of the findings when undertaking a <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> My intention was to examine the debates and conjecture surrounding claims made in relation to meta ethnography and meta aggregation as underpinning approaches to the systematic review of qualitative evidence, as these have attracted interest and polarised the opinions made of their proponents. In order to achieve this a multi phase study was undertaken, where phase one included the identification of a high quality, published meta ethnographic review and the conduct of a comparator meta aggregative review. Phase two consisted of a comparison between the two reviews, with each phase necessarily consisting of sections that worked to clarify the steps and stages taken in the conduct and reporting of the research that formed the basis of this thesis. The primary results of interest from this process were not the findings of the meta ethnographic review compared with the meta aggregative review, but the subsequent analysis of where and how differences originated. Interpretivism is the catch phrase of meta ethnography, yet it is by no means clear what is meant either by the originators; or by subsequent reviewers who have used the methodology but not explicated its philosophic foundations. Interpretivism is not a unified theory, it is instead a broad church; inclusive of many philosophical perspectives, specifically hermeneutics, phenomenology and symbolic interactionism. The particular claims to interpretivism for ethnographic reviews was examined and found to be a superficial and inadequate representation of the methodology. Specifically, hermeneutic phenomenology has been found to be ontologically and epistemologically congruent with the methodology and methods of meta ethnography. It also became evident that the methods-centric focus of meta aggregation has limited wider understanding of the methodology, leading to an incorrect association with integration. This study maintains that the interpretive foundations of aggregative synthesis are found in Husserlian Transcendental Phenomenology. This study suggests that the approach and purpose are the first two key points of decisionmaking. Therefore, reviewers interested in undertaking <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> should first consider what approach is a good fit with their purposes before deciding upon a methodology. Within the ‘interpretive philosophic’ perspective, the two core philosophies [of hermeneutic phenomenology (with fusion of horizons), and transcendental phenomenology] are where we must look to understand both the differences between meta aggregation and meta ethnography and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Increased prevalence and sustained professional and public interest in {{breast cancer in}} women has led to pervasive feminisation {{of the disease and}} related clinical practices, posing important ramifications for male patient-survivors. Our research adopts a critical health psychology perspective and is two-fold: (1) an international <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> of 8 existing studies looking at men's experiences of breast cancer; (2) an on-going study which involves collecting both verbal and photographic data from 31 British men who have experienced breast cancer.

A <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> was performed for all studies, and meta-analyses conducted among studies with mean differences (min/d) of sedentary time. PROSPERO: CRD 42014006535. Sixty-five controlled studies met inclusion criteria; 33 were used in the meta-analyses. Interventions with a focus on PA or that included a PA and SB component produced less consistent findings and generally resulted in modest reductions in sedentary time (PA: standardized mean differences [SMD][*]=[*]− 0. 22 [95 % confidence interval {CI}:[*]− 0. 35,[*]− 0. 10], PA[*]+[*]SB: SMD[*]=[*]− 0. 37 [95 % CI:[*]− 0. 69,[*]− 0. 05]). Moderate quality evidence from the randomized controlled trial meta-analysis coupled with the <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> provides consistent evidence that large and clinically meaningful reductions in sedentary time can be expected from interventions with a focus on reducing SBs (SMD[*]=[*]− 1. 28 [95 % CI:[*]− 1. 68,[*]− 0. 87][*]). There is evidence to support the need for interventions to include a component focused on reducing SBs in order to generate clinically meaningful reductions in sedentary time...|$|R
40|$|The Romani are a {{group of}} {{individuals}} that have been acknowledged in newspapers, television, movies {{and other forms of}} media but remain invisible as a people world-wide. Through the use of qualitative interviews, content analysis and <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis,</b> this study investigates why this phenomenon occurs in the United States as well as Europe. Overall, it was found that media portrayals negatively impact the Romani’s ability to successfully acculturate, increases their experiences of prejudice and discrimination and negatively impacts their social, physical and mental health. Romani media portrayals also appropriate the Romani’s ability to define themselves to mainstream society and impacts their identity development...|$|R
