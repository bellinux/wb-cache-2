5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E

500|$|According to musicologist Alan Pollack, [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] is [...] "an off-beat mixture" [...] of {{contemporary}} musical styles; he identifies it as [...] "a three-way cross between jazz waltz, folk song, and late sixties psychedelia". The song {{is in the}} key of F major, played with a capo on the guitar's third fret, so allowing for the chord shapes that Harrison admired in [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". The melody appears to <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> the home key, however, due to its avoidance of perfect cadences, as the dominant, C7 chord resists anchoring on the tonic I chord of F major. In addition, all plagal changes (in this case, B to F major) are fleeting. The composition also makes use of jazz-style ninth chords.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} four sections, the moods of the men <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> anger at their desperate situation, to a growing empathy for one another and the sudden realization that nature is indifferent to their fates. The men become fatigued and bicker with one another; nevertheless, the oiler and the correspondent take turns rowing toward shore, while the cook bails water to keep the boat afloat. When they see a lighthouse on the horizon, their hope is tempered with {{the realization of the}} danger of trying to reach it. Their hopes dwindle further when, after seeing a man waving from shore, and what {{may or may not be}} another boat, they fail to make contact. The correspondent and the oiler continue to take turns rowing, while the others sleep fitfully during the night. The correspondent then notices a shark swimming near the boat, but he does not seem to be bothered by it as one would expect. In the penultimate chapter, the correspondent wearily recalls a verse from the poem [...] "Bingen on the Rhine" [...] by Caroline Norton, in which a [...] "soldier of the Legion" [...] dies far from home..|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{possible}} FCS experiments involve chemical reactions that continually <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> equilibrium because of thermal motions (and then [...] "relax"). [...] In contrast to diffusion, {{which is also a}} relaxation process, the fluctuations cause changes between states of different energies. [...] One very simple system showing chemical relaxation would be a stationary binding site in the measurement volume, where particles only produce signal when bound (e.g. by FRET, or if the diffusion time is much faster than the sampling interval). [...] In this case the autocorrelation is: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, it was {{discovered}} that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as Johnson–Nyquist noise, is due to the discrete nature of charge. [...] This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> the value of R implied by the time average or ensemble average of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.|$|E
2500|$|Within this context, Meuffels and Soni {{pointed to}} a {{fundamental}} thermodynamic [...] principle: [...] Non-volatile information storage requires the existence of free energy barriers that separate the distinct internal memory states of a system from each other; otherwise, one would be faced with an [...] "indifferent" [...] situation and the system would arbitrarily <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> one memory state to another just {{under the influence of}} thermal fluctuations. When unprotected against thermal fluctuations, the internal memory states exhibit some diffusive dynamics which causes state degradation. [...] The free energy barriers must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit-error probability of bit operation. [...] Consequently, there is always a lower limit of energy requirement – depending on the required bit-error probability – for intentionally changing a bit value in any memory device.|$|E

2500|$|The nearly level High Desert Wetlands {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} high desert lakes and surrounding wetlands that provide critical habitat for nesting and migratory birds and associated upland birds and mammals. Elevation varies from 4,000to5,200feet (1,219to1,646m). The fine-textured soils are poorly drained, and basins collect water seasonally. Although water levels <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> year to year, lakes and wetlands {{in this region}} hold water more consistently than on the coarser, better drained soils of the Pluvial Lake Basins. Sedges, rushes, black greasewood, tufted hairgrass, mat muhly, meadow barley, creeping wildrye, and Nevada bluegrass occur in wetter areas. Drier areas support basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, silver sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and cheatgrass. The region covers [...] in Oregon, including the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and land surrounding Malheur Lake, Paulina Marsh, Summer Lake, Lake Abert, and the Warner Lakes. It also includes [...] in Idaho and [...] in Nevada, on and around the Duck Valley Indian Reservation [...]|$|E
2500|$|Primary roosts used by Indiana bats are {{typically}} snags in canopy gaps and forest edges that receive direct sunlight throughout the day. Alternate roosts are live or dead trees, generally {{located in the}} forest interior, that usually receive little or no direct sunlight. Weather, such as very warm temperatures and precipitation, appears to influence the use of interior alternate roost trees over primary roosts, as alternate roosts generally offer more shade and protection during inclement weather and extreme heat. However, this preference may <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> season to season. Indiana bats moved to the alternate roost during periods of heavy rain and colder ambient temperatures during fall in Missouri, but chose to roost in the primary snag during inclement weather in the spring. These differences {{may be attributed to}} variation in the heat retention capabilities of the trees at different times of the year. Gumbert and others [...] discovered bats from a maternity colony switched roosts more frequently in summer and autumn than they did in spring in an oak-pine forest in Kentucky. Indiana bats exhibit strong fidelity to individual roost trees from year to year if they are still suitable roost sites. Many trees are no longer usable after just a few years, while others may last as long as 20 years.|$|E
60|$|It {{is hardly}} {{probable}} that Hannibal could have really and honestly felt all {{the confidence that}} he expressed in his harangues to his soldiers. He must have had some fears. In fact, in all enterprises undertaken by man, the indications of success, and the hopes based upon them, will <b>fluctuate</b> <b>from</b> time to time, and cause his confidence in the result to ebb and flow, so that bright anticipations of success and triumph will alternate in his heart with feelings of discouragement and despondency. This effect is experienced by all; by the energetic and decided {{as well as by}} the timid and the faltering. The former, however, never allow these fluctuations of hope and fear to influence their action. They consider well the substantial grounds for expecting success before commencing their undertaking, and then go steadily forward, under all aspects of the sky--when it shines and when it rains--till they reach the end. The inefficient and undecided can act only under the stimulus of present hope. The end they aim at must be visible before them all the time. If for a moment it passes out of view, their motive is gone, and they can do no more, till, by some change in circumstances, it comes in sight again.|$|E
