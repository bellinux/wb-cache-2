The greatest is the Storm King Zandaros, both the High King of Inkarra and perhaps the mightiest human Air Wizard. As High King, all other kings of Inkarra must pay tribute to Zandaros. The Inkarrans despise the Rofehavanish, who they call the Dayborn, considering them to be utter barbarians.|$|E

25|$|Paranoia is {{a humorous}} {{role-playing}} game {{set in a}} dystopian future similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Logan's Run, and THX 1138; however, {{the tone of the}} game <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> <b>with</b> black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. Most of the game's humor is derived from the players' (usually futile) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to The Computer's arbitrary, contradictory and often nonsensical security directives.|$|E

Wolf argues that literature <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> <b>with</b> examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth, and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material {{to demonstrate that}} women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Act One {{is set in}} the local preacher Reverend Samuel Parris's attic. His ten-year-old daughter, Betty Parris, lies motionless. The previous evening, Reverend Parris discovered Betty, some other girls, and his Barbadian slave, Tituba, engaged in some sort of pagan ritual in the forest. The village <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> <b>with</b> rumors of witchcraft and a crowd gathers outside Rev. Parris' house. Parris becomes concerned that the event will cause him to be removed from his position as the town's reverend. He questions the girls' apparent ringleader, his niece Abigail Williams, whom Parris has been forced to adopt after her parents were brutally killed in the Pequot War. Abigail denies they were engaged in witchcraft, claiming that they had been dancing. Afterwards, the wealthy and influential Thomas Putnam and his wife, Ann arrive. At the Putnams' urgence, Parris reluctantly decides to invite Reverend John Hale, an expert in witchcraft and demonology, to investigate and leaves to address the crowd.|$|E

Goh later explained {{that it was not}} possible to be permissive in a country like Singapore with multi-racial and religious segments, since artistic express might be construed as disrespectful among active practitioners of a particular religion. The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> <b>with</b> the {{constant}} presence of fear which {{manifests itself in}} a seemingly endless variety of outlets. Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls' mother, Laura, near the chronological beginning of the book, as she [...] "sees the black V.W. , and her heart plummets right down to her toes". Even after the García family has spent several years in the United States, safe {{from the threat of}} Trujillo's retribution, a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos, their father, [...] "who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of 'revolt' out loud". This initial fear of Carlos' punishment {{for his role in the}} attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family’s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced.|$|E

Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> <b>with</b> emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'." [...] Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that [...] "'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple." ...|$|E
