500|$|In 2002, {{the tour}} {{documentary}} And All That Could Have Been was released featuring {{a collection of}} performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour. [...] While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying [...] "I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it", but later admitted that he [...] "can't watch [...] at all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> for most of that tour and I really don't think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best".|$|E
500|$|My {{specific}} {{intent is to}} bring attention {{to the millions of}} children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if {{you thought you were}} sick of the memes, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers did not try to predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
5000|$|Perry {{responded by}} stating that his films were meant as {{entertainment}} {{and should not be}} taken so seriously.

This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of him. He talked about Whoopi, he talked about Oprah, he talked about me, he talked about Clint Eastwood. Spike needs to shut the hell up!" ...|$|R

500|$|In July 2009, U.S. Senator James Webb {{asked the}} U.S. DoD Inspector General to {{formally}} examine the battle and the U.S. Army's {{investigation into the}} event. In his request, Webb cited an unreleased report from the Army's Combat Studies Institute by a contractor, Douglas Cubbison, that criticized how senior Army leaders in Afghanistan, especially Ostlund and Preyser, acted before the assault at Wanat. According to that report, soldiers at the Wanat base were critically short of basic necessities such as water and sandbags and had complained repeatedly, to no avail, that their base was in a precarious position. [...] Cubbison had written the report {{at the request of}} Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV, commander of the United States Army Combined Arms Center. Cubbison wrote that {{a few days before the}} battle, on July 4, a U.S. Army helicopter mistakenly attacked and killed 17 civilians, including all of the doctors and nurses at a local clinic, infuriating local Afghans. Platoon leader Brostrom and company commander Captain Matthew Myer told their commanders that they expected a retaliatory attack and asked for extra surveillance. Brostrom's father, retired Army Colonel David. P. Brostrom, alerted Webb's office to the Army historian's report. Said Brostrom, [...] "After I read the report, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Larible left Germany {{and started}} {{performing}} in England and Mexico. In 1991, {{he joined the}} biggest and most famous circus in the United States - Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. From 1993 to 2005, he was under contract and quickly became the main attraction. The time in the United States was characterized by hard work and achievement. Larible says, [...] "I would not miss a day, even if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick,</b> I went on." [...] On the other hand, he developed in those years, other trademarks, inventing new numbers and perfected his performance.

2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote {{a list of}} all the things that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her and bent over, forgetting that I was wearing a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' Oh, my goodness! I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like my wardrobe. I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, {{he played}} a small part in the film Walker, {{directed}} by Alex Cox, as a character named [...] "Faucet" [...] and wrote and performed on the film's soundtrack. [...] He starred in another Cox film that same year called Straight to Hell, as the character Simms. Straight to Hell also featured London-Irish folk/punk band the Pogues, both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist Philip Chevron, who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon {{and he was on}} tour in the USA as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped {{to the top of the}} guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage." [...] This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{own father}} went on radio to condemn her comments. A Confucian, Chương {{said that the}} regime had alienated [...] "the strongest moral forces", {{implying}} that they had lost the Mandate of Heaven. She responded by calling him a [...] "coward". Her mother said that [...] "There is an old proverb in my country which means 'one should not make oneself or one's family naked before the world'... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick...</b> Now, nobody can stop her ... She never listened to our advice." [...] After these comments, the U.S. ambassador, Frederick Nolting, told Diệm {{that if he did}} not denounce his sister-in-law's comment in public, the Americans would have to stop supporting him, but the president refused to do so, and assailed the monks. In an interview with David Halberstam, Madame Nhu said that it was [...] "embarrassing to see people [...] so uncultured claiming to be leaders". The American embassy told Diệm that these comments violated an agreement between the Buddhists and his regime to avoid verbal exchanges, but Diệm refused to keep his family's end of the bargain, saying that his sister-in-law was obliged to expose [...] "extremists" [...] to keep the public informed. In July, the US government rejected a request from her to travel to the United States for a public speaking tour, fearing a public relations disaster. On 3 August, she called the Buddhists [...] "seditious elements who use the most odious Communist tactics to subvert the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|He cites lack of {{commitment}} {{in the studio}} and the band's unwillingness to challenge his elaborate ideas as his main criticism: [...] "I just heard too many times, 'No, you can't do that'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> to death of it. I think it's a good record, {{but it could have been}} much better." [...] On the other hand, Buller has stated that the recording process had some [...] "happy accidents" [...] while the tape was running. Butler recorded separately from the rest of the band in a purpose-built lounge. There was a TV in the lounge and Butler can be heard tuning the TV at the beginning of [...] "The Asphalt World". At the end of the song Butler can be heard changing channels and picking up a section of dialogue from Lauren Bacall from the film Woman's World. Buller also talked of the impromptu recording of Butler playing the intro to [...] "The Wild Ones" [...] on a dobro outside as he sat on the roof of his car. Osman and Buller share similar views on the final recordings. For example, Buller described [...] "Still Life" [...] as being [...] "over-the-top." [...] While he said [...] "New Generation" [...] was in the wrong key, whose drums and mix were [...] "appalling." [...] Osman stated that he regretted the addition of the orchestra on [...] "Still Life" [...] but understood the appeal of it; and on [...] "New Generation," [...] he criticised the production, saying the song [...] "suffers from the murkiness of the mix." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
