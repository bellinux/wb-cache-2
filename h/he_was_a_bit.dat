5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot}} of ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> late {{coming into}} {{international}} cricket. He was already into his thirties {{when he first}} played for the national side. However, having waited {{for a long time}} to get his chance, he was quick to seize the opportunity presented to him. At Faridpur, playing for the Central Zone side, he took 3/24 against the MCC in 1980–81. With Obaidul Haq Azam taking 7/18, the tourists were bundled out for a 79 in their first innings. For Azhar, even bigger success came in three-day match at Rajshahi. By taking 6 wickets for 48 runs, he restricted the MCC side to 255.|$|E
500|$|These {{sequences}} {{were inspired}} by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series {{he was working on}} before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. [...] "I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where {{there were a lot of}} notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough. When recording the DVD commentary however, Jean said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dissatisfied with the new ending. [...] "I think we did leave it a little hanging", he said.|$|E

500|$|In the January 2010 {{issue of}} The Hockey News, Brashear was named Enforcer of the Decade, noting that {{although}} he did not lead the NHL in number of fights, during the decade, he would have been involved in more if [...] "he wasn't so feared." [...] Hockey analyst Bill Clement states that [...] "Brashear has a great sense of when his fighting skills are necessary and he picks his spots before dropping the gloves. He's excellent at understanding when a bit of pugilism might well provide the push or nudge to get some momentum going for his team." [...] The Hockey News also assessed his skills by saying he possessed one of the most intimidating packages in the League, had a decent skating stride {{and was one of the}} best pugilists in the NHL. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too deliberate when handling and passing the puck, and fought much less as he got older, while slowly breaking down over time.|$|E
500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels {{they have to}} go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Tubridy said {{he understood the}} comments as a joke. While appearing on The Ray D'Arcy Show to promote The Late Late Toy Show some weeks later, Tubridy responded to the incident: [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> em, British for my liking. I won’t be buying the books [...] In fact, I didn't take the free one".|$|E

50|$|Akira's {{childhood}} friend and hard-working factory employee. Has {{brown hair and}} eyes and is 178cm tall. Likes green curry flavored Solids. They grew up {{together in the same}} orphanage. Because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> weak, <b>he</b> has always admired Akira's strength.

2500|$|Of the jury, {{two members}} {{held out the}} first vote we took, but 10 of us were sure Ryan was guilty. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too sure of himself in the witness box {{but the thing that}} decided us was {{handling}} the rifle which had killed Hodson. We had been told the rifle had a hair trigger, but when we examined it we found we had to pull it at least half an inch and use quite a bit of force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{was issued}} nine {{citations}} for rules infractions in his career, {{with a total}} of 145 days suspended. [...] But in the year prior to his death, Jones had not been cited for any rules infractions. [...] Railroaders who worked with Jones liked him but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a risk taker. Unofficially though, the penalties were far more severe for running behind than breaking the rules. He was by all accounts an ambitious engineer, eager to move up the seniority ranks and serve on the better-paying, more prestigious, passenger trains.|$|E
2500|$|Pius IX celebrated several jubilees {{including}} the 300th {{anniversary of the}} Council of Trent. Pius celebrated the 1,800th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul on 29 June 1867 with 512 bishops, 20,000 priests and 140,000 lay persons in Rome. A large gathering was organized in 1871 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his papacy. The Italian government in 1870 outlawed many popular pilgrimages. The faithful of Bologna organized a nationwide [...] "spiritual pilgrimage" [...] to the pope and the tombs of the apostles in 1873. In 1875, Pius declared a Holy Year that was celebrated throughout the Catholic world. On the 50th anniversary of his episcopal consecration, people {{from all parts of}} the world came to see the old pontiff from 30 April 1877 to 15 June 1877. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> shy, but he valued initiative within the Church and created several new titles, rewards and orders to elevate those who in his view deserved merit.|$|E

2500|$|In one {{incident}} Dermot Whelan, Dave Moore and Siobhan O'Connor of radio station 98FM rewrote the Steps song [...] "Tragedy" [...] to include lyrics which make personal references to Tubridy before playing {{it on their}} morning radio show. The song pokes fun at his famous ears {{as well as his}} hairstyle with the line: [...] "His ears stand up like the FA Cup, he sits in his chair chatting with Holy Communion-style hair". Tubridy himself rang the show to congratulate Dermot, Dave and Siobhan on their achievement of [...] "taking the mick out of him" [...] with a song of [...] "pure ego" [...] that caused him to [...] "burst out laughing when I saw it". He was less pleased when Gordon Ramsay, appearing as a guest on The Late Late Show, poked fun at his ears and weight; Tubridy later remarked on The Ray D'Arcy Show: [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> em, British for my liking. I won’t be buying the books [...] In fact, I didn't take the free one".|$|E
2500|$|Jenkyns {{kept his}} place for Wales's 2–0 defeat to England the {{following}} Saturday, when Small Heath had no game. According to the Wrexham Advertiser, he was [...] "the {{best of the}} halves. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> slow, but his heading and tackling were very fine." [...] A friendly match at home to Football League club Bolton Wanderers produced a 7–0 win for Small Heath, which [...] "must have come as a great surprise to the supporters of either team". When they finally returned to Alliance action, at home to Bootle, they were again without Jenkyns, who was making his third appearance of the 1892 British Home Championship in a 6–1 defeat to Scotland. William Kendrick took his place, and reserve-team colleague Len Curryer replaced Morris at centre forward. Bootle had the better of the early game, and took the lead, but Heath came back with two goals from Wheldon, who also had a penalty saved, and two from Walton; Bootle were reduced to ten men {{for the second half}} through injury to one of their half-backs. Two days later, FA Cup-winners West Bromwich Albion had no difficulty eliminating a full-strength Small Heath side from the Birmingham Senior Cup.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{fears of}} {{instability}} {{that might be}} caused, the cabinet of ministers decided not to publicly proclaim the death of Menelik II. As a result, Iyasu was never officially proclaimed as Emperor Iyasu V. However, both Menelik's death and Iyasu's de facto accession were widely known and accepted. The Church authorities, the Lord Regent Ras Tessema, and the ministers agreed that Iyasu's coronation should be postponed until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> older and had taken Holy Communion with his wife, which would make his marriage insoluble {{in the eyes of}} the Orthodox Church. However, Iyasu quickly encountered problems with his rule and he was never crowned. He was widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior, and the church held him in suspicion for his alleged Muslim sympathies. After a troubled few years, Iyasu was removed from power. Zewditu was summoned to the capital, and on 27 September 1916, the Council of State and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church officially announced the death of Emperor Menelik II and deposed Iyasu in favour of Zewditu. Zewditu's official title was [...] "Queen of Kings" [...] (Negiste Negest), a modification of the traditional title [...] "King of Kings" [...] (Nəgusä Nägäst).|$|E

2500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Satono Diamond {{returned}} to the track in the Kobe Shimbun Hai (a major trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2400 metres at Hanshin on 25 September. He started the 1/5 favourite in a fifteen-runner field an won by a neck from the 26/1 outsider Mikki Rocket. Ikee commented [...] "that was his first outing {{in a while and}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> keen and also didn’t show his best in the finish either. Still, he won, so that’s the important thing." [...] In the 77th running of the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto on 23 October Satono Diamond started the 1.3/1 favourite in an eighteen-runner field which included Dee Majesty, Mikki Rocket and Air Spinel. He after racing in midfield he moved up on the outside entering the straight, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and quickened clear to win the race by two and a half lengths from the outsider Rainbow Line. After the race Lemaire said [...] "I’m excited and happy to be able to win a classic race {{for the first time in}} Japan. The colt was in his best condition and the only concern was the distance. But he responded really well in the last stretch so I was quite confident that we will win. He’s a top-class horse and will definitely be able to win other G1 races".|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{primary school}} at the Banda School in Nairobi, Froome moved to South Africa as a 14-year-old to attend St. Andrew's School, a publicly funded school in Bloemfontein and St John's College, a boarding independent school in Johannesburg. He then studied economics for two years at the University of Johannesburg. In South Africa Froome started to participate in road cycling. It was not until he was 22 that he turned professional. Froome started road racing in South Africa, specialising as a climber. Froome competed for Kenya in the road time trial and the road race at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where he finished 17th and 25th respectively, catching the attention of future Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford: [...] "The performance he did, on the equipment he was on, that takes some doing... We always thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a diamond in the rough, who had a huge potential." [...] While representing Kenya at the 2006 Road World Championships in the under-23 category in Salzburg, Austria, Froome crashed into an official just {{after the start of}} the time trial, causing both men to fall; although neither was injured, he finished in 36th place. Froome's appearance at the Worlds came about after he impersonated Kenyan cycling federation president Julius Mwangi by using Mwangi's email account to enter himself into the Championships, in order to add some European racing experience to his CV and boost his chances of obtaining a contract with a professional team.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Dinos {{was then}} aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over {{two and a}} half miles. The {{build-up}} to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lutece), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian Punch set the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos [...] "forged clear" [...] in the straight to win [...] "easily" [...] by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said [...] "I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> lazy. When I switched him on he found another gear and that's the sign of a good horse". Cole commented [...] "I've never had a runner in the Gold Cup and it's a race I've always wanted to win. I can't believe it's happened. We've had a terrible six weeks and we isolated him, and we've taken every single possible move to stop him getting the virus. It means a lot to everybody".|$|E
