5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Between 355 and 351BC, Demosthenes {{continued}} practising law privately {{while he}} was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines, two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In Against Timocrates and Against Aristocrates, he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> on foreign policy, such as {{the importance of the}} navy, of alliances and of national honour, are prosecutions (graphē paranómōn) against individuals accused of illegally proposing legislative texts.|$|E

The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words.|$|E

5|$|Su Song was a Hokkien who {{was born}} in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou. Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

While the law does not require any connection between the system of the administrative-territorial divisions of a federal subject and its municipal structure, Adygea's administrative districts are nevertheless incorporated as the municipal districts and the republican urban okrugs are incorporated as the municipal urban okrugs. On the lower level, the municipal districts are divided into municipal urban settlements, which combine an urban-type settlement and adjacent rural localities, and municipal rural settlements, which combine several neighboring rural localities.|$|E

5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
