5|$|Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, seeking advice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> of the Terrenon. He is {{attacked}} {{on the way}} by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes {{into the}} Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the stone of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Though Eastbourne is a {{relatively}} new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age. The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne.|$|E
5|$|Wright, {{an author}} of fiction and non-fiction works, uses the fallen civilisations of Easter Island, Sumer, Rome, and Maya, as well as {{examples}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age, to see what conditions led to the downfall of those societies. He examines the meaning of progress {{and its implications for}} civilizations—past and present—arguing that the twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population, consumption, and technology that has now placed an unsustainable burden on all natural systems.|$|E

5|$|Born in Birkenhead, Jones {{first became}} {{involved}} in archaeology while studying at the University of Liverpool, where she volunteered on W. J. Varley's excavations. After graduating {{she worked as a}} wartime postal censor and freelance photojournalist, whilst continuing to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain. In 1956, Jones began working for the Ministry of Works as a freelance archaeologist in the burgeoning field of rescue archaeology. She worked at a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at Mucking, a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age to the Medieval period. The Mucking excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at Mucking, as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The book {{tells the}} story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. Not knowing the stone's origin or worth, he {{attempts}} to use it as payment to a butcher. A dragon he later names Saphira hatches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> which was really an egg. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out the general location of the egg he sends the Ra'zac to acquire it. By that time Saphira had been growing for a while and takes Eragon to the Spine after Ra'zac appear in their village Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown, with a storyteller called Brom, and decide to search for the Varden, a group of rebels who want the downfall of Galbatorix.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} dwellings {{were probably}} built between 3000 and 2000 BC, {{with the introduction}} of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. Iron Age dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in long houses in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age have been excavated at Forsand in Ryfylke, near Stavanger and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Windows on {{the east}} façade are {{rectangular}} with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames. On the south façade, the ground floor windows are taller with a number being two- and three-lighted and stone framed. A chamfered two-storey bay is located slightly {{to the right of}} centre. Windows on the first floor are simpler and less tall. The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range. The north range is built up in red and grey brick <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> walls of the demolished range. The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647.|$|E
