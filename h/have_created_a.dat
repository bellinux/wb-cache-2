5|$|The broad {{variety of}} work {{produced}} using a semi-mechanized process with many collaborators, Warhol's popularity, {{the value of}} his works, and the diversity of works across various media and genre <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> need for the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board to certify the authenticity of works by Warhol.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth.

5|$|Alligators <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{niche in}} wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are {{integral to the}} survival of aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E
5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} would <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and {{sinking of the}} minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{brought in}} two {{experienced}} Harvard Law School-educated War Department lawyers, Brigadier General Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up}} the job of drafting the legislation. The legislation was based on Bush and Conant's proposal, and the organization that it proposed was based on the existing structure of the Manhattan Project. Their draft bill would <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, operate facilities, conduct research, regulate all forms of nuclear energy and administer its own security, administrative and audit regimes.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{implies that}} this {{occurred}} {{more or less}} directly after Labraunda, {{but it has also}} been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist John Hammond and his {{bioengineering}} company, InGen, <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{theme park}} called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a Costa Rican island, populated with cloned dinosaurs. After {{one of the}} dinosaur handlers is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. Gennaro invites mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is stunned to see a live Brachiosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science-fiction {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen. The first installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, {{it is based}} on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional islet of Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Lake Toba is {{the site}} of a massive supervolcanic {{eruption}} estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event. It is the largest known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, it had global consequences for human populations; it killed most humans living at that time and is believed to <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> population bottleneck in central east Africa and India, which affects the genetic make up of the human worldwide population to the present.|$|E
5|$|She {{was also}} a believer and a {{practitioner}} of magic, performing curses against those who she felt deserved it: in one case she cursed a fellow academic, Jaroslav Černý, when she felt that his promotion {{to the position of}} Professor of Egyptology over her friend Walter Bryan Emery was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes in}} {{demographic}} structure <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{number of social}} issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase {{in the cost of}} social security benefits like the public pension plan. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled. This decline was made worse by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E

The bill also would <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E
