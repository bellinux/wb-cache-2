Comparisons showed the intervention to produce a greater increase in income-to-needs and a greater rise-above-poverty threshold. Benefits to income-to-needs were statistically independent of maternal depressed mood, divorce status, child support, and repartnering. Financial stress reductions were explained by the intervention effect on income-to-needs. The importance of helping disadvantaged families with evidence-based programs is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{worldwide}} {{shift in}} the age structure of populations, with significant ageing, {{has resulted in the}} creation of a significant market segment with a need for aged care. The rapid expansion of a market base who typically have relatively high <b>discretionary</b> <b>incomes,</b> increased government funding and entry of commercial providers, have forced the traditional Not For Profit (NFP) providers to closely scrutinize their aged care strategies. The extant NFP literature is fragmented, and the role of organisational innovation, in gaining sustained competitive advantage in NFPs, has not received adequate attention. The marketing literature has focused on new product development of physical goods but this literature is generally silent on the integration issues of learning from the market and enfolding innovation in both service and physical goods, into the value chain for competitive advantage. This paper addresses these issues and models the antecedents of innovation-based competitive strategy in NFPs. Premised on the capability-based model of sustained competitive advantage; a framework is presented that examines the role of learning capabilities in innovation-based competitive strategy in NFPs. It is proposed that successful, entrepreneurial NFP organizations, with a mission to create social value for multiple stakeholders, build and nurture distinctive capabilities by learning both from the market and other sources. Key theoretical constructs within the model are explored, research propositions are presented and operationalisation issues are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Much {{analysis}} in macroeconomics empirically addresses economy-wide incentives behind consumer/investment choices by using insights {{from the way}} a single representative household would behave. Heterogeneity at the micro level can jeopardize attempts {{to back up the}} representative consumer construct with microfoundations. One complex aspect of micro-level heterogeneity is household size, as individuals living in multi-member households have the potential to share goods within the household, benefiting from household-size economies. Theoretically, we show that validating the role of a representative consumer would require that the way individuals benefit from intra-household sharing is strictly aligned across the rich and the poor: once expenditures for subsistence needs are subtracted from disposable household income, household-size economies the remainder (<b>discretionary)</b> household <b>incomes</b> entail must be the same across the rich and the poor. We have designed a survey method that allows the testing of this stringent property of intra-household sharing and find that it holds.

In that context, [...] "conspicuous consumption" [...] is discussed either as a behavioural addiction or as a narcissistic behaviour, or both, which are psychologic conditions induced by consumerism—the desire for the immediate gratification of hedonic expectations.|$|E

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have been {{characterized}} by an increasing uncoupling of economic growth and social and economic development. Outside of China, the numbers living in absolute poverty have remained stubbornly large; in Africa, they have increased substantially. Although this uncoupling has multiple sources, the trajectory of innovation (large in scale, capital intensive in nature and destructive of the environment) has contributed to these outcomes. Reorienting towards a more ‘inclusive innovation’ path has {{an important role to}} play in overcoming exclusion. However, we have only a weak understanding of the definition, nature and dynamics of inclusive innovation, and this paper seeks to fill this conceptual gap. It argues that inclusive innovation needs to be understood and developed {{in the context of a}} holistic conception of the innovation cycle, the distinction between process and product innovation and the roles played by the poor as both producers and consumer. It further charts the growing interest of private sector actors in inclusive innovation (including, but not confined to transnational corporations seeking the ‘fortune at the bottom of the pyramid’) and large global funds working in tandem with the private sector and governments. Consideration is also given to the role which growth trajectories play in determining the direction of innovation and in promoting linkages between the globally absolute poor (incomes below $ 1 pd) and those with <b>discretionary</b> cash <b>incomes</b> living in the margins above $ 1 pd. The paper concludes with a call for a more holistic and balanced approach to inclusive innovation to be adopted by a range of stakeholders so that resources are deployed most effectively to aid the recoupling of growth and development...|$|R
