30|$|With the {{increasing}} use of 3 D <b>entertainment</b> <b>and</b> multipurpose <b>representation</b> of virtual environments, range cameras continue to gain in popularity as prices are getting lower. While generally promising, there are shortcomings to the use of these sensors, which need to be resolved. Particularly, these cameras lack for color and some do not even provide a gray level or intensity image. This fact dramatically diminishes their scope for expansion into computer vision where image intensity is essential.|$|R

40|$|As {{both the}} {{skepticism}} and'hype'surrounding electronic environments vanish {{under the weight}} of ever increasing power, knowledge, and use of information technologies, the architectural profession must prepare for significant expansion of its professional services. To address the issue, this paper offers a survey of the professional services architects and designers do and may provide in digital space, and who the potential clients are. The survey was conducted by interviews with software developers, gaming companies, programmers, investigators, practicing architects, faculty, etc. It also included reviews of actual software products and literary research of conference proceedings, journals, books and newspapers (i. e. articles, classified ads, etc.). The actual and potential markets include gaming <b>and</b> <b>entertainment</b> developments, art installations, educational applications, and research. These markets provide architects the opportunity to participate in the design of 3 D gaming environments, educational software, architecture for public experience <b>and</b> <b>entertainment,</b> data <b>representation,</b> cyberspace <b>and</b> virtual reality studies, and other digital services which will be required for this new world. We will demonstrate that although the rapidly growing digital market may be seen by some to be non-architectural and thus irrelevant to our profession, it actually represents great opportunities for growth and development. Digital environments will not replace the built environment as a major architectural market, but they will significantly complement it, thus strengthening the entire architectural profession...|$|R
