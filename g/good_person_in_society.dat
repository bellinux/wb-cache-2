40|$|This paper {{review the}} {{literature}} regarding {{the barriers to}} participation of older <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> the African <b>society.</b> Studies have shown that older persons are vulnerable and thus {{do not participate in}} most development programmes <b>in</b> <b>society</b> to improve their livelihoods. Research has further shown that there are factors that could be hindering their participation <b>in</b> <b>society.</b> This paper attempts to highlight some of the barriers that hinder participation of older <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> the African communities. The authors conclude that the barriers to effective participation of older <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> include the state of older people's personal health, poverty and the negative and limiting community attitudes, laws and practices. Pensions, social grants and allowances are among the means through which the elderly cope. However not all older persons have access to pensions as the majority did not work in government. Furthermore, most countries in Africa except for a few such as Mauritius, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana and Lesotho have not considered giving their senior citizens social grants to improve on their livelihoods...|$|R
