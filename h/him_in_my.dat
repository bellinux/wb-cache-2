500|$|Berg {{served on}} Princeton University's Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2003. In 2000, he began researching a {{biography}} of Woodrow Wilson, of whom Berg says, [...] "I have an image of <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that is unlike any picture I have seen anywhere else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". Wilson was published on September 10, 2013.|$|E
500|$|I am a {{defeated}} {{and ruined}} war captive, that's it! The former emperor [...] treated me generously, but I betrayed <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past I {{have heard that}} Han law stipulates that executions of men be {{carried out in the}} city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [...] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire.|$|E
500|$|As king, Edward VII {{proved a}} greater success {{than anyone had}} expected, {{but he was already}} past the average life {{expectancy}} and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his [...] "best friend and the best of fathers... I never had a [...] word with <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't 'ave <b>'im</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house," [...] {{retorted}} Mr. Kybird, quickly. [...] "An Englishman's 'ouse is his castle, and I won't 'ave <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mine." ...|$|R
60|$|The Minister had {{consented to}} help us. On his {{arrival at the}} prison, I {{received}} <b>him</b> privately <b>in</b> <b>my</b> study.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{complete}} stranger," [...] Mr. Ascough agreed. [...] "I {{had never}} seen <b>him</b> before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I did a little trifling business for <b>him</b> <b>in</b> connection with his property." ...|$|R
500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Edwards {{held off}} a last lap charge from Jeff Gordon {{to win the}} Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway. “Real tough. That last lap was ugly. I grew up {{watching}} Jeff Gordon do well here so to have <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mirror is special," [...] Edwards said. [...] "This team has been working very hard. The whole group has. It's very special {{to be a part}} of something like this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Then {{said the}} Most High, the Holy and Great One spoke, and sent Uriel {{to the son}} of Lamech, and said to him: [...] "Noah> and tell <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> name 'Hide thyself!' and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{took him}} and wrapped <b>him</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bundle of medicines, {{and outside of}} all I rolled a mat of plaited grass.|$|R
60|$|That settled it. That's {{the police}} all over, and that's 'ow {{they get their}} way and do as they like. I could see <b>'im</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind's eye talking to the guv'nor, and letting out little things about broken glasses and such-like by accident. I drew back to let 'im pass, and I was so upset that when that little rat of a {{landlord}} follered 'im I didn't say a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Approve?" [...] cried Newman. [...] "I {{wish that}} when I had him there, night before last, I had locked <b>him</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cabinet de toilette!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Piave's {{text was}} based on a prose {{translation}} by Carlo Rusconi that had been published in Turin in 1838. Verdi did not encounter Shakespeare's original work until after the first performance of the opera, although he had read Shakespeare in translation for many years, as he noted in an 1865 letter: [...] "He {{is one of my favorite}} poets. [...] I have had <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands from my earliest youth".|$|E
2500|$|... "Falsafi {{managed to}} fool both the Shah and the {{military}} authorities and start a campaign against the Bahá’ís that dragged {{the country to the}} edge of disaster. It was Ramadan. [...] noon sermons were broadcast throughout the nation via radio and caused violence and terror in many locations. People killed a few Bahá’ís here and there. Falsafi justified these acts by saying that they increased the Shah’s prestige. I {{had no choice but to}} order <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own rash way, to refrain from giving further speeches until order was reestablished." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 610, Heraclius, an Armenian, revolted against Phocas {{and killed}} him, {{crowning}} himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. He {{then tried to}} negotiate peace with Khosrow II by sending diplomats to his court. Khosrow, however, rejected their offer and said: [...] "That kingdom belongs to me, and I shall enthrone Maurice's son, Theodosius, as emperor. , he went and took the rule without our order and now offers us our own treasure as gifts. But I shall not stop until I have <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands." [...] Khosrow then had the diplomats executed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know it, and, therefore, I {{must see}} <b>him.</b> Take <b>in</b> <b>my</b> card, {{and he will}} not refuse me.' A new vista had opened itself before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} he knows me," [...] said Cashel, heartened by her gracious {{reception}} of a nervous bow. [...] "I never saw <b>him</b> before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{you speak of}} him," [...] I answered, {{drinking}} <b>him</b> <b>in</b> with <b>my</b> glance. I added internally, [...] "Not half good enough for you." ...|$|R
2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait. I agreed with joy, all the more so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> garden, where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E
2500|$|World Champion Emanuel Lasker {{believed}} that if Atkins had devoted more time to chess, he would have {{become one of the}} world's leading players. Sir George Thomas, one of Britain's leading players {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, observed, [...] "H. E. Atkins ranks, indisputably, as the greatest figure in English chess since Amos Burn, and only lack of opportunity prevented <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, from definitely establishing his position in the world championship class." [...] Anne Sunnucks writes that, [...] "His devotion to teaching and his insistence on treating chess as merely a game was all that prevented him from becoming one of the leading players of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} was created using Blake's distinctive tempera technique, {{which he describes}} in the lower right of the panel, beneath the shell gold signature, as [...] "fresco". On the reverse of the panel is written, [...] "The Vision of the Spirit that inhabits {{the body of a}} Flea, and which appeared to the late Mr. Blake, the Designer of the vignettes for Blair Grave and the Book of Job. The Visions first appeared to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> presence, and after wards till he had finished this picture. The Flea drew blood on this." [...] Today the work is in relatively poor condition, partly due to the technique employed by Blake. Areas of the surface have cracked and dulled with age.|$|E
60|$|I helped <b>him</b> <b>in,</b> {{recalled}} <b>my</b> address with an effort, {{and got in}} also. Something unusual proclaimed itself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> tail-coat pocket, and I {{felt and}} discovered a glass ball. With a petulant expression I flung it into the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are such}} an un-understandable chap," [...] complained a fellow Clubman to <b>him</b> once <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing. [...] "I {{sometimes}} ask myself {{if you have}} any opinions at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} wonder that I defend him," [...] said the girl, [...] "could {{you have seen}} him as I saw <b>him,</b> battling <b>in</b> <b>my</b> behalf with that huge hairy brute.|$|R
2500|$|Berg began researching Wilson in 2000: [...] "I have {{an image}} of <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that is unlike any picture I have seen {{anywhere}} else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". “When {{most people think of}} Woodrow Wilson, they see a dour minister’s son who never cracked a smile, where in fact {{he was a man of}} genuine joy and great sadness. I did not write a diplomatic history or a history of foreign affairs in his life. I wanted the reader to walk through his life and see it with his eyes.” [...] "It takes a certain amount of egotism for a biographer to think he has something new to add to the record, and I believe I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions from his young age {{throughout}} his life, and in these visions he was visited by many spirits {{of people from the}} remote past as well as by his deceased friends from whom he [...] received his inspiration for his poetry and painting. [...] He also believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In 1800 he wrote: “I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part. Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> remembrance, in the region of my imagination. I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} I was standing in front of <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I should lose my learned Hakim," [...] said Richard, [...] "merely by {{absence of}} {{his cap and}} robe, and that I should find <b>him</b> again <b>in</b> <b>my</b> royal brother Saladin!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He sought me. I seized <b>him</b> fishing <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket. I {{found he}} had no belongings, and that his most commodious lodging-house {{was one of the}} huge {{worn-out}} boilers near Nine-Elms--an illustration for Watts's Hymns, Theodora.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Colston, [...] "though Jernyngham seldom {{shows his}} feelings, I {{know he has}} grieved over his son. There can be no {{question}} that Cyril should have returned; I've told <b>him</b> so <b>in</b> <b>my</b> letters." ...|$|R
2500|$|On April 25, 2012, Mase {{featured}} alongside Diddy on Wale's [...] "Slight Work" [...] remix, {{marking the}} first {{appearance of the}} Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer Omarion, were both signing to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an A representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, [...] "Excuse My French," [...] as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's [...] "Everything's a Go." [...] "I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make," [...] Montana says, [...] " [...] I {{would love to see}} <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> camp." [...] Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy. In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled RockaByeBaby, to positive reception. Rapper Los announced his departure from Bad Boy Records on March 19, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Malik was {{approached}} by Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in July 2003 {{to act as a}} replacement for Ian Harvey, who was on international duty with Australia. John Bracewell, the club's director of cricket, commented that he was [...] "excited by the prospect of signing an international spinning all-rounder to replace Ian during the Cheltenham Festival and the C semi-finals. He will add a new and refreshing dimension to the squad... which is in keeping with our playing philosophy to both win and entertain". He sufficiently impressed in two County Championship and three one-day matches that resulted in renewing of his contract for the 2004 season. Mark Alleyne, the club's head coach, remarked that [...] "Shoaib did very well for us last year in the short time he was with us and fitted in very well. He is a gifted all-rounder who is worthy of a place in either discipline and as a 21-year-old, he can only get better and I am really pleased at having <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> squad". Over the course of his two seasons at Gloucestershire, Malik played eight first-class matches, scoring 214runs at an average of 17.83 with two fifties and taking 15wickets at an average of 45.06, with best bowling figures of 3/76. He also played twelve one-day matches, scoring 345runs at an average of 43.12 with three fifties and taking 10wickets at an average of 47.60, with best bowling figures of 3/28.|$|E
