25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only {{have come from the}} SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing about}} this, {{conductor}} Michael Gielen stated: [...] "When he said <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening at Sirius, I {{turned away from}} him in horror. I haven't listened to a note since", and called Stockhausen's statements [...] "hubris" [...] and [...] "nonsense", {{while at the same time}} defending his own belief in astrology: [...] "Why should these large celestial bodies exist if they do not stand for something? I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is much we do not understand" [...]|$|E
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going to happen. Magda then went {{back up to the}} Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should,' said Psmith kindly. 'The {{officer is}} {{speaking}} in your best interests. A man of taste and discernment, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best. His advice is good, {{and should be}} followed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' said Jonas; 'then you, and I, and Chuffey, and the doctor, {{will be just}} a coachful. We'll {{have the}} doctor, Pecksniff, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> the matter with him, and that it couldn't be helped.' ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{wrote of}} an apostle who didn't have the easiest time being a Christian. [...] "Now Paul! Did he {{live in the}} favor of the mighty so that it could commend his {{teaching}}? No, he was a prisoner! Did the wise hail his teaching so that their reputation could guarantee its truth? No, to them it was foolishness. Was his teaching capable of quickly supplying the individual with a supranatural power, did it offer itself for sale to people through legerdemain? No, it had to be acquired slowly, appropriated in the ordeal that began with the renunciation of everything." [...] Would Paul have become a Christian if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in store for him? Each single individual has a future and {{there comes a time when}} a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects. Paul wrote about his own experiences in his epistles and Kierkegaard thought this was a legitimate way to preach about Christianity. But he stressed indirect communication.|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> good for him." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} do so, Robert must obtain the {{approval}} of his commanding officer, who refuses because the captain thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best for his men. Robert is transferred away from Paris immediately. He deserts, but is arrested. Lise now feels even more abandoned because Robert does not show up for their wedding.|$|R

Ah! well, I'm an old woman, and I may be wrong, but my poor dear Mr. Meadows {{would never}} {{encourage}} a banker's clerk {{about the house}} unless <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> his expectations.

6000|$|... "Say, Cap, what's eatin' you?" [...] asked Arthurs. He looked dumfounded. Ken hung to him desperately; {{he thought}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming. There were hurried {{footsteps}} {{in the corridor}} and excited voices.|$|E
6000|$|Demi's eyes sparkled as Josie {{held up a}} paper cocked hat, but as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} in it, he took {{the wind out of}} Josie's sails, and filled her with blank astonishment by saying carelessly: ...|$|E

50|$|One {{source of}} the {{discomfort}} is the cognitive dissonance induced by the inherent contradiction of a king ordering democracy: follow the king's order because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best for the people; move toward democracy because the people are best suited to rule themselves. The King's position is that this uneasiness is precisely why it is the perfect time for such changes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not he," [...] said Bittern. [...] "He {{is a great}} man, if not a sailor; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> politeness on shipboard, and as he is {{the last}} comer you must be the first caller.

60|$|Philip's {{heart beat}} fast. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming and was dreadfully frightened, {{but in his}} fright {{there was a certain}} exultation. He had never been swished. Of course it would hurt, but it was {{something}} to boast about afterwards.|$|E

"Yes, sir, I have {{handed him}} over, and glad I {{was to get}} him off my hands; for though I had him handcuffed and his feet tied, and brought him along in a cart, I never felt {{comfortable}} all the way.

6000|$|... "Nine {{years this}} autumn," [...] {{answered}} Morris, setting his mouth a little, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming.
