500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

2500|$|The 4° Stormo flew {{its last}} mission against Yugoslavia on 14 April 1941: on that day, 20 C.200s from 10° Gruppo flew up to 100km south of [...] Karlovac without meeting any enemy aircraft. Operations ended on 17 April. During those 11 days, the 4° Stormo had not lost a single C.200. Its pilots {{destroyed}} {{a total of}} 20 seaplanes and flying boats, while damaging a further 10. Additionally, they had set on fire an oil tanker, a <b>fuel</b> <b>truck,</b> several other vehicles and destroyed port installations.|$|E
2500|$|Freighting {{aviation}} {{fuel to the}} aerodrome {{was one of the}} most challenging aspects of operating the airport. At first the club freighted up fuel in barrels, but the fire department soon placed restrictions on this activity. The club then started filling at Værnes, where Shell would drive their [...] <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> along a narrow dirt road to fill [...] on the aircraft during high tide at the mouth of Stjørdalselva. Shell announced that they would terminate this service from 1982, and the club received permission to bury a [...] tank at Valset. During the 1980s and 1990s the airport typically saw between 130 and 200 flight hours per year.|$|E

50|$|As a {{landlocked}} nation, Nepal imports {{all of its}} petroleum {{supplies from}} India. Roughly 300 <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> enter from India on a normal day, but this has dwindled to a sporadic passage of 5-10 <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> daily {{since the start of}} the crisis, though shipments of perishables like fruits and vegetables have generally been allowed to pass.Moreover, India had also been stopping some Nepalese trucks at the Kolkata harbour. The blockade choked imports of not only petroleum, but also medicines and earthquake relief material.|$|R
50|$|Henderson Field {{was also}} {{very close to the}} thinly-held lines of the U.S. First Marine Division, so {{security}} was always a concern. There were no <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> aircraft hangars, or repair buildings. Damaged aircraft were cannibalized for spare parts, and with no bomb hoists, all aircraft munitions had to be hand-loaded onto the warplanes. Fuel, always critically low, had to be hand pumped out of 55 gallon drums. Even after the arrival of <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> aviation gasoline still had to be hand-pumped into the trucks.|$|R
2500|$|New Mexico {{became a}} center for the {{advancement}} of top secret military technology during the war. Two very important technological important breakthroughs occurred within the state, along with one comical, but interesting, incident involving the use of Mexican free-tailed bats as a weapon. The Bat Bomb Incident, as it is known, occurred in 1943 and {{was the result of a}} project by Dr. Lytle S. Adams to attach tiny explosive devices to bats in order to use them as a type of bomb against Japanese cities. While testing the [...] "weapon" [...] at the Carlsbad Army Airfield, some of the bats accidentally escaped and roosted underneath a <b>fuel</b> <b>truck.</b> The ensuing explosions [...] "incinerated the test range" [...] and set some buildings on fire, but apparently no one was harmed.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Kunduz airstrike {{against two}} {{captured}} fuel tankers in September 2009 which killed insurgents {{as well as}} scores of civilians who had gathered to steal fuel from a Taliban-captured <b>fuel</b> <b>truck,</b> the German government finally reclassified the Afghanistan deployment in February 2010 as an [...] "armed conflict within the parameters of international law", allowing German forces to act without risk of prosecution under German law. While the German contingent had previously relied on lightly armoured and -armed infantry mobility vehicles such as the Dingo and the Fennek armoured reconnaissance vehicle (along with unarmoured utility vehicles), heavy weapons were now brought to the area. While addressing troops {{in the wake of}} a deadly attack on April 15, 2010, then Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg announced his decision to deploy Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Pzh2000 self propelled artillery to Kunduz in order to better protect troops and [...] "max" [...] their [...] "punch". The military would also go on to acquire new weapons and vehicles better suited for combat in the hot and rugged Afghan countryside. Around the same time, US forces were called into Northern Afghanistan to reinforce the German contingent and provide Regional Command North with direly needed aviation and air mobility assets. ISAF's headquarters in Kabul decided to upgrade its northern presence and placed a German Major-General in command.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{goal of the}} program is to install underground fuel hydrants at airports. These would eliminate the need for <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> an important source of mobile emissions.
