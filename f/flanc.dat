40|$|Within the Baltic Shield several {{very large}} {{structures}} {{have been identified}} and are suspected to be of meteorite impact origin. Some of these deeply eroded circular features are presented with {{special attention to the}} Uppland structure, where several indications point toward an impact origin in the mid-Proterozoic. The structures exceed 100 km in diameter and the topographic expression is inferior or absent. An arcuate arrangement of lithologies occurs around the margin of the structures and the central regions show conform magnetic and positive gravity anomalies. The Uppland structure is approximately 320 km in diameter as expressed by morphological, geological, and geophysical concentric patterns. The central part is topographically remarkably flat and is characterized by an unusual irregular fracture pattern. A subcircular central tonalite with density of 2. 81 Mg(sup - 3) gives a positive gravity anomaly of 35 mgal and the gravimetric profile is very similar to that of Manicouagan and Vredefort. The tonalite constitutes a huge antiform, 80 km in diameter, probably representing a 12 -km structural uplift of infracrustal rocks. The <b>flancs</b> of the tonalite are characterized by recrystallized pseudotachylitic breccia dykes and breccia zones. Around the central parts amphibolite-grade metamorphic rocks appear as large fragments within a fine-grained granite interpreted as a thermally annealed melt rock. Several occurrences of breccia dykes and breccia-bearing melts have been identified about 100 km from the gravimetric center of the structure. Impact-related ore deposits are located around the margin of the structure and are interpreted as preexisting downfaulted iron formations, and deposits formed from remobilization of these preimpact occurrences. The so-called ball ores are interpreted to have formed by fluid injection similar to the formation of breccia dykes. The extensive hydrothermal alteration along the outer margin of the structure have created extreme soda and K-enriched rocks ('leptites') from preexisting gneiss granites and supracrustal sedimentary gneisses...|$|R

The study is divided into three sections, dealing respectively with the poems ("Au Jardin de l'Infante", "Aux <b>Flancs</b> du Vase", "Le Chariot d'r'" Poemes Inacheves); the "Contes"; and the two-act tragedy in verse, "Polypheme". A much more detailed examination lias been made of the "Contes" than of the other parts of Samainrs work, because they are relatively unknown, because little has been written about them, and because {{it seems to me that}} they constitute one of the finest parts of Samain's work. The section dealing with the poems is subdivided into a number of parts, in which Samain's various poetic styles are discussed (e. g., symbolist poems, elegiac love-poems, pseudo-Greek idylls) and in which some space is devoted to Samain's undoubted imitation of other writers; and the relative value of these poems written in various styles is indicated. The sections dealing with the "Contes" and "Polypheme" are subdivided alike under the headings Sources; Style; Psychology; Underlying Philosophy; and an effort has been made to show that in the two works the treatment of the subjects is essentially the same.

5000|$|According to the Encyclopédie, wolf hunting squads in France {{typically}} {{consisted of}} 25-30 good sized dogs, usually grey in color with red {{around the eyes}} and jowls. The main pack would be supplemented with six or eight large sighthounds and a few dogues. Wolf hunting sighthounds were usually separated into three categories; lévriers d'estric, lévriers compagnons (or lévriers de <b>flanc)</b> and lévriers de tête. It was preferable to have two teams of each kind, with each team consisting of 2-3 dogs. It is specified that one can never have enough bloodhounds in a wolf hunt, as the wolf is the most challenging quarry for the hounds to track, due to its light tread leaving scant debris, and thus very little scent. This was not so serious a problem in winter, when the tracks were easier to detect in the snow. Each bloodhound group would be used alternatively throughout the hunt, {{in order to allow}} the previous team to recuperate. Because of the wolf's feeble scent, a wolf hunt would have to begin by motivating the bloodhounds with repeated caresses and the recitation in old French; [...] "va outre ribaut hau mon valet; hau lo lo lo lo, velleci, velleci aller mon petit". It was preferable that the area of the hunt contained no stronger smelling animals which could distract the dogs, or that the dogs themselves were entirely specialised in hunting wolves. Once the scent had been found, the hunters would give a further recitation in order to motivate the dogs; [...] "qu'est-ce là mon valet, hau l'ami après, vellici il dit vrai". The scent was usually found at a crossroad, where the wolf would scratch the earth or leave a scent mark. The two teams of lévriers d'estric would be placed at separate points on the borders of the forest, where the wolf was expected to run to. The lévriers compagnons would be concealed {{on either side of the}} path, while the lévriers de tête, which were the largest and most aggressive, would initiate the chase once the wolf was sighted. The lévriers de tête would chase the wolf through the path and funnel it toward the other waiting lévrier teams. Once the wolf was apprehended, the dogs would be pulled back, and the hunters would place a wooden stick between the wolf's jaws in order to stop it injuring them or the dogs. The hunt master would then quickly dispatch the wolf by stabbing it between the shoulder blades with a dagger.|$|E

Looking at the small numb er of Caluber radiatus in our catches, one may get the impression that it may be much less common than was generally though t.

O início dos sintomas após a administração oral variou entre 15 min. e 2 h 05 min., na aplicação por aspersão variou entre 6 h 28 min. e 8 h 38 min. A evolução nos casos de administração oral foi de 4 a 9 dias, nos de aspersão de 5 a 6 dias. Somente morreram animais que receberam a administração oral. Um animal aspergido com o amitraz foi sacrificado. Por via oral foram usadas dosagens de 5, 5 mg/kg (uma administração), 5, 8 mg/ kg (duas administrações) e num terceiro animal, doses que variaram entre 7, 2 e 36, 4 mg/kg (cinco administrações). Nas aplicações por aspersão, a intoxicação foi reproduzida com soluções nas concentrações de 0, 1 e 0, 2 %. Com relação ao sistema nervoso, os principais sinais observados foram apatia, sonolência, ptoses palpebral e auricular, dificuldade de apreensão, mastigação e deglutição do alimento, arrastar das pinças dos cascos no solo, exposição do pênis, sensibilidade cutânea diminuída/ausente, instabilidade em estação, abdução dos membros, cabeça baixa, incoordenação, bocejos, flacidez labial, exposição da língua, cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar, resposta {{postural}} diminuída após cruzar e abduzir os membros, reflexos do lábio superior, palatal, lingual, de deglutição e flexor diminuídos/ausentes, reflexos auricular, palpebral e de ameaça diminuídos e resposta ambulatória diminuída ao teste de girar em círculo de pequeno raio. No que se refere ao sistema digestivo, foram evidenciados, principalmente, hipomotilidade/atonia intestinal, edema dos lábios, distensão abdominal, deitar e levantar com freqüência, rolar no solo, olhar para o flanco, gemer e impactação do intestino grosso. Observaram-se ainda taquicardia, aumento do tempo de preenchimento capilar e mucosas congestas, estridor, taquipnéia, dispnéia, secreção nasal, bradipnéia e respiração abdominal. Todos os três casos naturais ocorreram após aspersão do amitraz. Os primeiros sintomas foram observados 2 e 3 dias após o banho. A evolução foi de 6, 7 e 17 dias. Um animal manifestou a maioria dos sinais referentes ao sistema nervoso observados nos experimentos, com exceção dos sinais de cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar, bocejos, lábios flácidos e exposição do pênis. Outro animal, intoxicado espontaneamente, manifestou somente sintomas digestivos como rolar, “patear”, hipomotilidade/atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso. Um terceiro animal, inicialmente manifestou sintomas digestivos caracterizados por patear, rolar, atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso, com conseqüente desenvolvimento de laminite; na fase final exibiu acentuada sintomatologia nervosa mostrando compressão da cabeça contra obstáculos, incoordenação motora com cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar e relutância em se movimentar. Baseados no quadro clínico observado, são sugeridos possíveis locais de lesão no sistema nervoso. Poisoning by amitraz was experimentally {{reproduced in}} 17 horses and a donkey. First symptoms were observed between 15 min. and 2 h 5 min. after oral administration, and between 6 h 28 min. and 8 h 38 min. after spraying with amitraz. The course of poisoning after oral administration was 4 to 9 days, and after spraying 5 to 6 days. Death of experimental animals occurred only after oral administration. One animal was euthanized after spraying. Doses of 5. 5 mg/kg (1 administration), 5. 8 mg/kg (2 administrations) and doses which varied between 7. 2 and 36. 4 mg/kg (5 administrations) were used when amitraz {{was given by}} mouth, all causing symptoms of poisoning. When the administration of amitraz was by spraying, poisoning was reproduced with solutions of 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. Regarding the nervous system, the main signs observed were recumbency, somnolence, palpebral and auricular ptosis, difficulties in apprehension, chewing and swallowing of food, dragging of the hooves, exposure of the penis, diminished or absent cutaneous sensibility, instability, abduction of the legs, lowering of the head, incoordination, jawning, labial flacity, exposure of the tongue, crossing of the legs when walking, diminished postural response after crossing or abducting the legs, diminished/absent reflex of the upper lip, palatal, tongue, flexor and swallowing reflex, diminished auricular, palpebral and menace reflex. The ambulatory response was diminished when tested by walking in circles of small radius. Regarding the digestive system, the signs were mainly intestinal hypomotility/atony, edema of the lips, abdominal distention, frequent lying down and standing up, rolling on the ground, looking at the <b>flancs,</b> groaning and impaction of the large bowel. Regarding the circulatory system, the main clinical signs were tachycardia, increase of the refilling time of capillaries, congested mucosa and splitting of the cardiac sounds. Regarding the respiratory system, stridor, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, nasal discharge, bradypnoea and abdominal respiration was observed. Beside these signs, there were alterations of the general condition, as apathy and hypothermia. All natural cases occurred after spraying with amitraz. First symptoms were seen 2 to 3 days after the application of amitraz. The course was 6, 7 and 17 days.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the interplay between tectonics and sedimentation increases when salt tectonics is involved because of the ductility of salt {{and its ability to}} flow. Discrimination between extensional tectonics and salt-related processes is problematic; especially where salt-related rift basins were inverted as occurred in the Central High Atlas in Morocco. The aim of the present work was to analyse and understand the dynamics of the Central High Atlas diapiric basin during the Early Jurassic rift and subsequent post-rift periods using a multidisciplinary workflow integrating fieldwork, analogue models and subsidence and thermal numerical modelling. Two regions were examined to assess the effects of salt tectonics {{in the evolution of the}} basin; the Djebel Bou Dahar platform-basin system represented the fault domain of the rift basin where diapiric activity was not described and the Tazoult-Amezraï area and Imilchil diapiric province corresponding to the unstable domain of the basin characterised by the presence of diapiric salt ridges and minibasins. Results from analogue models highlighted the intrinsic interrelation between extension, diapirism and sedimentation that characterised the diapiric domain of the Central High Atlas. Longitudinal and transverse sedimentary progradations and their timing had a strong impact in the migration of ductile layers, in the growth of diapirs and in their lateral structural variations; triggering well-developed passive diapirs in the proximal domains and incipient reactive diapirs or poorly developed roller-like and passive diapirs in the distal domains of the sediment source. Analogue models including post-diapiric compression fairly reproduced the observed structure in the studied areas. Modelling with 6 % and 10 % of shortening, slightly lower than the Atlas one, produced the progressive close-up of the two flanks of salt walls and their final welding as well as the steepening of their outward flanks, with dips increasing from 8 o- 17 o prior to compression to 30 o- 50 o after compression. Subsidence curves varied depending on the analysed localities of the rift basin. Djebel Bou Dahar showed long-term and low-rate tectonic and total subsidence (0. 06 and 0. 08 mm yr- 1, respectively). The roughly parallel evolution of both total and tectonic subsidence curves indicates the main extensional tectonic influence on subsidence pattern, as corroborated by the syndepositional activity of the outcropping Sinemurian-Pliensbachian normal faults. In the unstable domain, Amezraï minibasin centre showed tectonic and total subsidence rates between 0. 06 - 0. 32 and 0. 19 - 0. 98 mm yr- 1, rates one order of magnitude higher than in the Djebel Bou Dahar. These subsidence rates were up to two-fold their equivalent rates in the Tazoult salt wall (0. 01 - 0. 27 and 0. 09 - 0. 74 mm yr- 1). In the Imilchil diapiric province lateral shifts of the main subsiding depocenters were recorded during Toarcian to Callovian times (tectonic and total subsidence rates up to 0. 23 and 0. 90 mm yr- 1). The subsidence of the unstable domain was caused by the combination of normal fault extension and salt withdrawal from beneath the minibasins during rifting, being the salt-related subsidence predominant during the post-rift and masking the expected subsidence pattern for a rift-post rift transition. For the first time, 27 new vitrinite reflectance data were used to build the thermal evolution and associated geohistory of the Central High Atlas. Thermal models, with heat flows of 105 mW/m 2 (from 189 to 140 Ma) followed by 60 mW/m 2 and 70 mW/m 2 (from 189 to 182. 7 Ma) followed by 60 mW/m 2, pointed to a post-Middle Jurassic evolution characterised by long-term and low-rate subsidence and an overburden between 1200 - 2400 m on the Tazoult-Amezraï area. The comparison of subsidence curves from this study with Saharan Atlas and Tunisian Atlas showed that peak of subsidence in these salt-related domains became younger to the east. La discriminació entre processos associats a tectònica extensiva i a tectònica salina es problemàtica; especialment en conques diapíriques extensives invertides com és el cas del Alt Atles Central de Marroc (CHA). L’objectiu d’aquesta tesis és analitzar i entendre els processos que interaccionaren a la conca diapírica del CHA durant el rift Juràssic i el subseqüent període post rift, utilitzant una metodologia multidisciplinària que integra treball de camp, models analògics i models numèrics. S’han estudiat dos dominis de la conca: no diapiric i diapiric (diapirisme durant el Juràssic Inferior i Mitjà).

Els models amb compressió post-diapírica mostren que dita compressió produeix la reducció progressiva de l’amplada de les estructures diapíriques fins al seu tancament complet, així com a un increment dels cabussaments dels <b>flancs</b> com s’ha observat a les zones d’estudi. Les corbes de subsidència varien segons el domini analitzat. El domini no diapiric es caracteritza per un període llarg de baixes taxes de subsidència tectònica i total (0. 06 i 0. 08 mma- 1). El domini diapiric registra taxes de subsidència tectònica i total fins a un ordre de magnitud majors que en el domini no diapiric (0. 23 i 0. 90 mma- 1) i una migració dels depocentres subsidents. La subsidència del domini diapiric s’interpreta, durant el rift Juràssic Inferior, com una combinació d’activitat de falles normals i migració salina, sent aquesta darrera la predominant durant la fase post-extensiva i emmascarant el patró de subsidència esperat en un estadi de transició rift-post rift. Per primera vegada, es presenta la geohistòria de la part central del CHA. Els models tèrmics emprats per a la seva construcció, avaluats amb 27 noves dades de reflectància de vitrinites de la zona d’estudi, suggereixen una evolució post-Juràssic Mitjà caracteritzada per un període llarg de baixa subsidència que hauria enterrat la regió entre 1200 - 2400 m, en comptes de una complexa historia que inclouria diversos esdeveniments d’exhumació com s’ha enregistrat en altres zones del Alt Atles Marroquí...|$|R

Immunosuppressive regimens of glucocorticoids combined with cytotoxic drugs, particularly cyclophosphamide, was effective and standard {{for the treatment of}} severe proliferative lupus nephritis (Hahn et al. 2012; Contreras et al. 2004; Ferrantelli et al. 2005; <b>Flanc</b> et al. 2004; Austin et al. 1986; Illei et al. 2001; Gourley et al. 1996; Steinberg and Steinberg 2005; Rezaie-Yazdi et al. 2005; Mok et al. 2001; Ioannidis et al. 2000; Grootscholten et al. 2007).

40|$|This work compiles {{the results}} of the {{analysis}} of hydrographical data collected in January 2008 over the western sector of the South Scotia Ridge (SSR). The cruise was carried out on board R/V Hespérides in the framework of the Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction (SASSI) study, one of the core projects endorsed by the International Polar Year. SASSI focused on shelf-slope processes taking place all along the Antarctic continental slope, paying particular attention to the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and its associated westward Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). The Spanish contribution to SASSI (framed by the E-SASSI project) focused on the SSR region between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands, bounded to the north by the Scotia Sea and to the south by the Weddell Sea. The main objectives of E-SASSI were (1) to quantify the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and to determine how these waters contribute to the modification of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC); (2) to determine the role of the Antarctic Slope Front in these processes; and (3) to track the path of the Antarctic Slope Current before diluting into the Scotia Sea. This thesis aims to answer these questions. The sector of the SSR located between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands is a region of especial interest. First because the gaps indenting the ridge constitute the first gate for the outflow of relatively shallow, recently ventilated waters from the northwestern Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea. Second, because of the complexity of the bathymetry: a deep trough (the Hesperides Trough) separates the northern and southern flanks of the ridge and the location and depth of the different gaps indenting the ridge constrain the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current. A key feature of the E-SASSI cruise with respect to previous studies conducted in the region is the unprecedented high spatial resolution of the hydrographic survey, particularly over the continental slopes. Also the coverage of all the gaps of the northern flank of the ridge was a novelty of E-SASSI. Both features have allowed a better quantification of the water mass transports in the region. The E-SASSI physical data consist mainly of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and ship-mounted Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler (ADCP) measurements. The presence of narrow jets, the rough topography, the strong tidal currents observed in theregion, and the fact that velocity measurements were available only for the upper 500 meters of the water column, they all handicapped the determination of the barotropic component of the flow. Inverse modeling based on the conservation of volume, heat, and salt over an enclosed region was used to refine the barotropic component of the velocity pattern initially estimated from the adjustment of the baroclinic component of velocity profiles to the ADCP measurements. The regional circulation, including the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current, was inferred from the joint analysis of CTD profiles and the velocity field inferred from the inverse model. Results from a cross-slope section located in the Weddell Sea side show the well-defined structure of the Antarctic Slope Front before reaching the SSR. At the firsts gaps indenting the southern flank of the SSR the ASC has been observed to break into two branches: an inshore branch following the upper levels of the slope (700 m) and an offshore branch extending over the 1600 m isobath. At the northern flank the sampling covered all the gaps of the ridge and several cross-slope sections into the Scotia Sea. The inshore branch of the ASC was detected crossing a relatively shallow gap that prevents the outflow of the offshore, deeper branch and acts as a barrier for Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). In spite of the higher velocities of the outflow, this shallow gap is less important in terms of Warm Deep Water (WDW) transport than the deeper Hesperides Passage hosting the outflow of the deeper branch of the ASC. This passage accounts for most of the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and is the only gate of WSDW through the western sector of the SSR. The transports inferred from the inverse model give a net outflow of 7 ± 5 Sv, 2 Sv corresponding to WSDW and most of the other 5 Sv being WDW. In addition to the determination of the circulation pattern we have also analyzed inflow/outflow θS diagrams. They show an overall homogenization of the outflowing waters with respect to the more variable incoming Weddell Sea waters. In the last part of this thesis we show that isopycnal mixing between inshore and offshore water masses taking place within the Hesperides Trough is the main process for the modification of subsurface and intermediate layers. We also describe the role of the ASF {{in the formation of the}} most modified WDW observed before reaching the SSR and study the contribution of this water to the modification of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, in the southwestern sector of the Scotia Sea. Aquest treball reuneix els resultats de l’anàlisi de dades hidrogràfiques preses el gener de 2008 durant una campanya oceanogràfica a la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud (Antàrtida). La campanya es va dur a terme a bord del R/V Hespérides en el marc del projecte SASSI (Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction study), un dels projectes clau de l’Any Polar International. Aquest projecte va tenir com a objectiu l’estudi de processos entre la plataforma i el talús continental antàrtics, amb una especial atenció al Front de Talús Antártic i al seu corrent associat que flueix en sentit oest, el Corrent de Talús Antàrtic. La contribució espanyola a SASSI (el projecte E-SASSI) es va centrar en el sector oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud, entre les illes Shetland del Sud i Orcades del Sud, flanquejat al nord pel Mar d’Escòcia i al sud pel Mar de Weddell. Els objectius principals d’E-SASSI eren: (1) quantificar l’exportació d’aigües del Mar de Weddell cap al Mar d’Escòcia i determinar com aquestes aigües contribueixen a la modificació de la Frontera Sud del Corrent Circumpolar Antàrtic; (2) determinar el paper que juga el Front de Talús en tots aquests processos; i (3) traçar el camí que recorr el Corrent de Talús abans de diluir-se en el Mar d’Escòcia. Aquesta tesi tracta de respondre totes aquestes qüestions. El sector oest de la dorsal és d’especial interés. Primer perquè els passos que s’obren al llarg de la dorsal constitueixen la primera porta de sortida cap al Mar d’Escòcia d’aigües relativament poc fondes i recentment ventilades que flueixen al llarg del marge nordoest del Mar de Weddell. Segon, degut a la complexitat de la batimetria: la localització i fondària d’aquests passos, a més de l’existència d’una fossa submarina que separa aquesta banda de la dorsal en un <b>flanc</b> nord i un <b>flanc</b> sud (la Fossa d’Hespèrides), són tots factors que afecten al pas del Corrent de Talús per sobre de la dorsal. Els punts claus de la campanya E-SASSI respecte d’estudis precedents duïts a terme en aquesta regió són, d’una banda, l’elevada resolució espacial del mostreig hidrogràfic, sobretot al talús continental, i d’altra, la cobertura del mostreig, que abastà tots els passos del <b>flanc</b> nord de la dorsal. Ambdós aspectes han estat una aportació fonamental per part d’E-SASSI, per quan han permès una millor quantificació dels transports d’aigües en aquesta regió. El conjunt de dades físiques d’E-SASSI són majoritàriament dades de conductivitat, temperatura i pressió (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth, CTD) i de velocitat (Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler, ADCP). La presència de corrents prims, lo abrupt de la batimetria, els forts corrents de marea observats a la regió, i el fet de disposar de mesures directes de la velocitat només en els primers 500 metres de la columna d’aigua, tot plegat fa que la determinació del component baròtrop del fluxe sigui complicada. La modelització inversa és una tècnica que es basa en la conservació de volum, calor i sal a una regió de perímetre tancat. Aquest tècnica s’ha emprat per refinar el component baròtrop del patró inicial de velocitat obtingut a partir de l’ajust del component baroclí a dades d’ADCP. La circulació regional, i en particular el traçat del Corrent de Talús, s’ha obtingut a partir de l’anàlisi conjunt de les dades de CTD i del camp de velocitats donat pel model. Quan als resultats, una secció hidrogràfica d’E-SASSI mostra el Front de Talús perfectament estructurat just abans d’arribar al <b>flanc</b> sud de la dorsal. És al primer pas d’aquest <b>flanc</b> on el Corrent de Talús se separa en dues branques: una interior que flueix a la part alta del talús (700 m) i una de més externa que segueix la isobata de 1600 m. Al <b>flanc</b> nord el mostreig va cobrir tots els passos i diverses seccions que travessen el talús cap a dintre del Mar d’Escòcia. La branca interna del Corrent de Talús es va detectar creuant un pas relativament poc profund, que per altra banda no només evita la sortida de la branca més externa sinó també la de Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). Tot i les intenses velocitats del fluxe de sortida, aquest pas no és tan important com el Pas d’Hespèrides pel que fa a exportació de Warm Deep Water (WDW). Aquest pas no només permet la sortida de la branca externa del Corrent de Talús, sinó que és l’única porta de sortida de WSDW a la banda oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud. Els transports obtinguts pel model invers han donat un fluxe net de sortida de 7 ± 5 Sv, dels quals 2 Sv són WSDW i gran part dels 5 Sv restants corresponen a WDW. A més de la determinació de la circulació regional hem comparat les característiques d’entrada i sortida de les aigües a sobre de diagrames θS. L’anàlisi ha mostrat una homogeneïtzació de les aigües del Mar de Weddell quan travessen la dorsal. Hem mostrat que això és degut a processos de mescla isopicna a la Fossa d’Hespèrides pel que fa a la modificació de les capes subsuperficial i intermèdia. També hem descrit al darrer punt de la tesi el paper que juga el Front de Talús en la formació de la forma més modificada de WDW observada abans d’entrar a la dorsal i la seva contribució en la modificació de la Frontera Sud del ACC al sudoest del Mar d’Escòcia...|$|E
40|$|In Northern Iceland, {{the active}} rift is located 120 km eastward {{with respect to}} the Kolbeinsey Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Tjörnes Fracture Zone connects these two rifts and {{accommodates}} a dextral transform motion. A major active fault of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone is the WNW-ESE trending Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF). The seismic activity associated to the HFF defined a nearly vertical fault surface that cuts through the 12 km thick seismogenic crust. Analyses of major structures combined with inversion of fault slip data allow us to discuss the kinematics and mechanics of the HFF since the Late Tertiary. For the present-day kinematics, we also use inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms provided by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The main state of stress along the HFF corresponds to a dextral transtension, with an ENE-WSW trending extension due to the obliquity of the transform fault relative to the E-W direction of plate divergence. This overall mechanism is subject to slip partitioning that include an extension trending NW-SE, parallel to the HFF, and an extension trending NE-SW, perpendicular to the fault. These three regimes do not reflect a succession in time of tectonic events, but occur simultaneously at different places and in various chronological orders. They are thought to express the geometric accommodation of the transform motion in the oblique transform zone. Near the connection of the HFF to the Kolbeinsey Ridge, most dextral transform faults that trend parallel to the HFF are replaced by normal faults with a dextral component. On {{the opposite side of the}} HFF, at its junction with the northern Icelandic rift, two main transform fault segments have been mapped out. The northern fault directly connects to the northern Icelandic rift as a triple point junction, whereas the southern one progressively evolves from a WNW-ESE trending dextral transform fault to a N-S trending normal fault, parallel to the direction of the rift structures. One hypothesis, which would explain these structural differences, involves the presence of pre-existing structures, like volcanoes, that affect the direction of propagation of the southern transform fault segment. Another hypothesis would be that the southern transform fault, the oldest between these two transform faults, developed and then was connected to the northern Icelandic rift before the rift propagated northward. After this northward propagation of the northern Icelandic rift, the northern transform fault segment propagated linearly to the rift. Moreover, near the junction of the HFF with the northern Icelandic rift, the behaviour of the normal faults associated with the rift appears to be strongly influenced by the dextral transtension characterising the HFF. On other hand, seismic faults have been mapped out near the eastern border of the Flateyjarskagi shelf. Inversions of related focal mechanisms suggest that movements associated with the present-day unlocking of the eastern part of the HFF, considered as locked until recently because of its low seismic activity, are compatible with the proposed model of dextral transtension. The present-day offset between the Kolbeinsey Ridge and the northern Icelandic rift results from an eastward rift jump of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. As the North American-Eurasian plate boundary drifts westward, eastward rift jumps relocate the rift zones above the Icelandic hotspot. Using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of dykes along a profile parallel to the direction of plate motion in Northern Iceland, a paleo-rift axis has been recognised 60 km eastward to the previously accepted location. This paleo-rift, localised in the continuation of fjord of Skagafjördur and referred to as, remained active until approximately 3 Ma ago. The activity of the northern Icelandic rift started about 8 - 8. 5 My ago, intruding the presently dated 9 - 9. 5 Ma old eastern flank of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. This age of 1 Ma for the intruded paleo-rift rocks at the rift jump time is considered as a minimal value, resulting to hypotheses assumed in the theoretical model for the dating data interpretation. An important plio-pleistocene glacial erosion, inducing a decrease of the lava pile thickness and thus a diminution of the area covered by the production of the northern Icelandic rift, would explain the presence of dykes related to the northern Icelandic rift as far as 25 km outside of its borders. The two rifts were thus simultaneously active during 5 - 5. 5 Ma. During this period, the accretion rates along the two rift zones were nearly equal. However, accretion was asymmetrical along each rift, with the higher rate of accretion situated on the external flank. The supposed absence of drift from the northern Icelandic rift since its initiation implies a strong asymmetry of accretion, favouring the Northern American plate. A decrease of the hotspot activity would release the northern Icelandic rift and allow it to drift westward with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Then, an increase of the hotspot activity would facilitate the shift of the accretion zone above to the hotspot by an eastward rift jump. The tectonic changes related to the last rift jump explains the observed deformations in Northern Iceland. The Skagafjördur paleo-rift shrank, after it became extinct, both towards the Kolbeinsey Ridge and towards the active volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone of central Iceland probably corresponds to an "en échelon" zone between the northern and the southern Icelandic rifts. The weight of the lava flows spread out by the volcanic zone of central Iceland since 3 Ma has induced a flexuring of the tertiary lava flow pile produced by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. In a similar way, the lava flows erupted by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift have been flexured by those erupted by the northern Icelandic rift. These flexures are directed towards the volcanic zone of central Iceland and towards the northern Icelandic rift, respectively. They define a continuous flexure belt through Northern Iceland. An important extensive fracturing is related to the flexure of the lava flows. Such a flexure would explain that the synform-like arrangement of the lava flows, considered as a characteristic of an Icelandic rift axis, is absent along the southern part of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift axis, whereas such a structural shape is recognised along its northern part. The synform that was initially thought to localise the axis of the paleo-rift would be the axis of the flexural zone produced by the weight of plio-pleistocene lava flows erupted from the south, in the volcanic zone of central Iceland. Despite the limited number of radiochronological data available as time constraints in Southern Iceland, a global model of the tectonic evolution of the island, based on the model proposed for the evolution of Northern Iceland, is presented. This model highlights the importance of the volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone would accommodate the differences in the tectonic evolution, like diachronisms in rift jump process and consequently shifts of the accretion zones, between the northern and southern parts of Iceland. Le rift nord islandais peut être considéré comme l'équivalent émergé de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey. Il est cependant décalé de 120 km vers l'est par rapport à celle-ci. La Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes, une zone transformante dextre, absorbe ce décalage. L'analyse des grandes structures ainsi que l'inversion de données de failles à stries ont permis de caractériser la géométrie et le fonctionnement de la faille d'Húsavík-Flatey (FHF), l'une des structures majeures de la Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes. L'inversion de mécanismes au foyer, fournis par l'Office Météorologique Islandais, a permis de compléter l'étude, pour la période actuelle. L'obliquité de la FHF, de direction WNW-ESE, par rapport à la divergence des plaques de direction E-W induit depuis la fin du Tertiaire une transtension dextre de direction ENE-WSW le long de la FHF. Ce mouvement transtensif se partitionne localement en une extension de direction NE-SW, sub-perpendiculaire à la FHF, et une extension de direction NW-SE, sub-parallèle à la FHF. Ces trois régimes ne correspondent pas à une succession bien définie d'épisodes régionaux mais à des variations locales et temporelles du mouvement transformant. A proximité de la jonction de la FHF avec la dorsale de Kolbeinsey, les failles dextres qui accommodent principalement le mouvement décrochant sont majoritairement remplacées par des failles normales à composante dextre. A l'autre extrémité de la FHF, au niveau de sa jonction avec le rift nord islandais, la faille est divisée en deux branches parallèles. L'une d'elles se connecte directement au rift nord islandais en définissant un point triple tandis que l'autre branche évolue progressivement d'une faille transformante de direction WNW-ESE jusqu'à une faille normale de direction N-S parallèle au rift. Ces différences structurales s'expliqueraient par la propagation vers le nord du rift nord islandais ainsi que par l'influence de structures préexistantes, telles que des volcans, lors du développement de ces deux failles. De plus, le fonctionnement du rift nord islandais à proximité de la FHF paraît fortement influencé par celui de cette dernière. Enfin, l'activité séismique liée à l'actuel déblocage de la partie de la FHF bloquée depuis la dernière crise éruptive du rift nord islandais s'intégrerait dans le modèle de fonctionnement en transtension dextre de cette faille. Le décalage du rift nord islandais et de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey résulte d'un saut vers l'est de la zone d'accrétion nord islandaise. La dérive vers l'ouest de la dorsale médio-Atlantique par rapport au point chaud islandais serait à l'origine de tels sauts. A partir de datations 40 Ar/ 39 Ar de dykes échantillonnés le long d'un profil parallèle à la direction de divergence des plaques, l'initiation de l'actuel rift nord islandais a été datée à 8 - 8. 5 Ma. Elle eut lieu dans des roches qui n'avaient alors que 1 Ma. Le paléo-rift, dont l'axe a été localisé le long du fjord de Skagafjördur, c'est-à-dire 60 km à l'est de l'emplacement généralement admis, et le rift actuel ont fonctionné simultanément et de façon asymétrique, l'accrétion étant plus importante sur leurs <b>flancs</b> extérieurs, jusqu'à 3 Ma. L'absence supposée de dérive du rift nord islandais par rapport au point chaud implique une très forte asymétrie d'accrétion de la plaque Nord Amérique par rapport à la plaque Eurasie. Si l'activité du point chaud venait à diminuer, le rift nord islandais pourrait être libéré et dériver vers l'ouest jusqu'à ce qu'un nouveau pulse mantellique provoque un saut de rift vers l'est et ramène la zone d'accrétion à l'aplomb du point chaud. Les déformations observées dans le Nord de l'Islande s'expliquent par la réorganisation tectonique liée au dernier saut de rift. Le mécanisme d'abandon du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur est interprété comme un retrait symétrique et synchrone vers la ride de Kolbeinsey et vers la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande, cette dernière constituant probablement une zone de relais entre les rifts nord et sud islandais. Le poids des laves émises depuis 3 Ma par la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a provoqué une flexuration des laves issues du paléo-rift vers le centre de l'Islande de la même manière qu'elles ont été flexurées par et en direction de celles émises par le rift nord islandais. Cette profonde réorganisation structurale expliquerait l'absence d'une synforme le long de la partie méridionale du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur alors qu'une telle synforme, caractéristique d'un rift en Islande, est présente le long de sa partie septentrionale. La synforme initialement considérée comme localisant l'axe du paléo-rift dans le Nord de l'Islande ne serait alors que l'axe d'une zone de flexure due à l'épanchement des laves plio-pléistocènes. Malgré la faible quantité de données radiochronologiques disponibles pour la partie sud de l'Islande, le modèle d'évolution tectonique proposé pour le Nord de l'Islande a été intégré dans un schéma d'évolution de l'ensemble de l'île. En accommodant les différences d'évolution entre les parties nord et sud de l'île, telles que le diachronisme entre les sauts de rift ayant eu lieu dans ces deux parties de l'Islande et donc le décalage des zones d'accrétion au travers de l'île, la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a ainsi joué un rôle primordial tout le long du développement de l'île...|$|R
6000|$|... {illust. caption = FIG. 14.--Head of snarling Dog. From life, by Mr. Wood. whole {{appearance}} of the face. The lips hang loosely, and the hair remains smooth. All these movements or gestures are explicable, as I believe, from their standing in complete antithesis to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a directly opposite state of mind. When a man merely speaks to, or just notices, his dog,we see the last vestige of these movements in a slight wag of the tail, without any other movement of the body, and without even the ears being lowered. Dogs also exhibit their affection by desiring to rub against their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by them. Gratiolet explains the above gestures of affection in the following manner: and the reader can judge whether the explanation appears satisfactory. Speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he says,[2] [...] "C'est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les caresses ou les donne. Lorsque toute la longueur des <b>flancs</b> et du corps est sensible, l'animal serpente et rampe sous les caresses; et ces ondulations se propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite." [...] Further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may be concentrated on the caresses of their master! Dogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters. They sometimes lick other dogs, and then it is always their chops. I have also seen dogs licking cats with whom they were friends. This habit probably originated in the females carefully licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of cleansing them. They also often give their puppies, after a short absence, a few cursory licks, apparently from affection. Thus the habit will have become associated with the emotion of love, however it may afterwards be aroused. It is now so firmly inherited or innate, That it is transmitted equally to both sexes. A female terrier of mine lately had her puppies destroyed, and though at all times a very affectionate creature, I was much struck with {{the manner in which}} she then tried to satisfy her instinctive maternal love by expending it on me; and her desire to lick my hands rose to an insatiable passion. [1] `De la Physionomie,' 1865, pp. 187, 218.The same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling affectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or patted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with a beloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the emotion of love. The feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is combined with a strong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. Hence dogs not only lower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach their masters, but sometimes throw themselves on the ground with their bellies upwards. This is a movement as completely opposite as is possible to any show of resistance. I formerly possessed a large dog who was not at all afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like shepherd-dog in the neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so powerful as my dog, had a strange influence over him. When they met on the road, my dog used to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in between his legs and hair not erected; and then be would throw himself on the ground, belly upwards. By this action he seemed to say more plainly than by words, [...] "Behold, I am your slave." [...] A pleasurable and excited state of mind, associated with affection, is exhibited by some dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning. This was noticed long ago by Somerville, who says, And with a courtly grin, the fawning bound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose Upward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes Melt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.' The Chase, book i.Sir W. Scott's famous Scotch greyhound, Maida, had this habit, and it is common with terriers. I have also seen it in a Spitz and in a sheep-dog. Mr. Riviere, who has particularly attended to this expression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect manner, but is quite common in a lesser degree. The upper lip during the act of grinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are exposed, and the ears are drawn backwards; but the general {{appearance of}} the animal clearly shows that anger is not felt. Sir C. Bell[3] remarks [...] "Dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion of the lips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that resembles laughter." [...] Some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but if it had been really a smile, we should see a similar, though more pronounced, movement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark of joy; {{but this is not the}} case, although a bark of joy often follows a grin. On the other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades or masters, almost always pretend to bite each other; and they then retract, though not energetically, their lips and ears. Hence I suspect that there is a tendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively pleasure combined with affection, to act through habit and association on the same muscles, as in playfully biting each other, or their masters' hands. I have described, in the second chapter, the gait and appearance of a dog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented by the same animal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears, body, tail, and chops drooping, and eyes dull. Under the expectation of any great pleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner, and bark for joy. The tendency to bark under this state of mind is inherited, or runs in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the Spitz-dog barks so incessantly on starting for a walk with his master that he becomes a nuisance. [1] `The Anatomy of Expression,' 1844, p. 140.An agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many other animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the whole body. Attention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears erected, and eyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under observation. If it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is often turned obliquely from side to side in a most significant manner, apparently in order to judge with more exactness from what point the sound proceeds. But I have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise, turning, his head to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived the source of the noise. Dogs, as formerly remarked, when their attention is in any way aroused, whilst watching some object, or attending to some sound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it doubled up, as if to make a slow and stealthy approach. A dog under extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his excretions; but the hair, I believe, does not become erect unless some anger is felt. I have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians who were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his body trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats could hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth, in the same manner as a terrified man does. Yet this dog had not exerted himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the room, and the day was cold. Even a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown by the tail being tucked in between the legs. This tucking in of the fail is accompanied by the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not pressed closely to the head,as in snarling, and they are not lowered, as when a dog is pleased or affectionate. When two young dogs chase each other in play, the one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked inwards. So it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight. He then acts as if another dog were chasing him. This curious kind of play, which must be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs, is particularly apt to be excited, after the animal has been a little startled or frightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in the dusk. In this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each other in play, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the other catching him by the tail; but as far as I can find out, dogs very rarely catch each other in this manner. I asked a gentleman, who had kept foxhounds all his life, and be applied to other experienced sportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they never had. It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters, and that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail is then drawn closely inwards. A similarly connected movement between the hind- quarters and the tail may be observed in the hyaena. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the wonderful power of each other's jaws, and are extremely cautious. They well know that if one of their legs were seized, the bone would instantly be crushed into atoms; hence they approach each other kneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible inwards, and with their whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any salient point; thetail at the same time being closely tucked in between the legs. In this attitude they approach each other sideways, or even partly backwards. So again with deer, several of the species, when savage and fighting, tuck in their tails. When one horse in a field tries to bite the hind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy strikes a donkey from behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn in, though it does not appear as if this were done merely to save the tail from being injured. We have also seen the reverse of these movements; for when an animal trots with high elastic steps, the tail is almost always carried aloft. As I have said, when a dog is chased and runs away, he keeps his ears directed backwards but still open; and this is clearly done for the sake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer. From habit the ears are often held in this same position, and the tail tucked in, when the danger is obviously in front. I have repeatedly noticed, with a timid terrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some object in front, the nature of which she perfectly knows and does not need to reconnoitre, yet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail in this position, looking the image of discomfort. Discomfort, without any fear, is similarly expressed: thus, one day I went out of doors, just at the time when this same dog knew that her dinner would be brought. I did not call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at the same time she wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first looking one way and then the other, with her tail tucked in and ears drawn back, presenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed discomfort. Almost all the expressive movements now described, with the exception of the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they are common to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds. Most of themare likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog, namely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the same group. Tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters, jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground belly upwards.[4] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from the Gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. Wolves and jackals, when frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been described as careering round his master in circles and figures of eight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs. It has been stated[5] that foxes, however tame, never display any of the above expressive movements; but this is not strictly accurate. Many years ago I observed in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a very tame English fox, When caressed by the keeper, wagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards. The black fox of North America likewise depressed its ears in a slight degree. But I believe that foxes never lick the hands of their masters, and I have been assured that when frightened they never tuck in their tails. If the explanation which I have given of the expression of affection in dogs be admitted, then it would appear that animals which have never been domesticated--namely wolves, jackals, and even foxes-- have nevertheless ac- quired, through the principle of antithesis, certain expressive gestures; for it is Dot probable that these animals, confined in cages, should have learnt them by imitating dogs. [4] Many particulars are given by Gueldenstadt in his account of the jackal in Nov. Comm. Acad. Sc. Imp. Petrop. 1775, tom. xx. p. 449. See also another excellent account of the manners of this animal and of its play, in `Land and Water,' October, 1869. Lieut. Annesley, R. A., has also communicated to me some particulars with respect to the jackal. I have made many inquiries about wolves and jackals in the Zoological Gardens, and have observed them for myself.

40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution, body {{orientation and}} mobility of pike free embryos were studied at 10 °C in 25 -cm individual water columns. Five steps were identified: (1) a resting phase, up to day (D) 4 post-hatching; (2) an ascent phase (D 1 –D 4); (3) a plateau (D 5 –D 8), characterized by a wall-attachment behaviour in the subsurface zone; (4) a break-off phase (D 9 –D 13); and (5) a final localization between mid-water and surface, corresponding to the air filling of the swim bladder and to the transition to active, horizontal swimming (D 14 –D 17). Free embryos could be: side-lying (phase 1, late phase 4 and phase 5); lying upright (phases 4 and 5); vertically suspended with adhesion to the wall (phases 2 – 3 and early phase 4); and in oblique or horizontal position (phase 5). The opening of mouth and anus occurred during phases 2 and 3 and swim bladder filling started on days 13 – 14. Free embryo mobility was low and stable during the first 5 days and increased regularly thereafter to reach maximal levels on days 14 – 16. This research provides evidence for a more complex and more variable temporal pattern of free embryo vertical distribution, posture and mobility than previously thought.

La répartition verticale, l’orientation corporelle et la mobilité de l’embryon libre de brochet ont été étudiées dans des colonnes d’eau individuelles de 25 cm à 10 °C. Cinq étapes ont été identifiées : (1) une phase de repos, pouvant durer jusqu’à 4 jours (J) après éclosion; (2) une phase ascensionnelle (J 1 –J 4); (3) un plateau (J 5 –J 8) caractérisé par un comportement d’adhésion à la paroi en subsurface; (4) une phase de rupture (J 9 –J 13); et (5) une localisation finale entre la mi-profondeur et la surface, correspondant au remplissage de la vessie natatoire et au passage à une nage active dans le plan horizontal (J 14 –J 17). Les orientations corporelles suivantes ont été observées : position allongée sur le <b>flanc</b> (phase 1, fin de phase 4, phase 5); position allongée sur l’abdomen (phases 4 et 5); suspension verticale avec adhésion aux parois (phases 2 – 3 et début de phase 4); et position oblique ou horizontale (phase 5). L’ouverture de la bouche puis de l’anus est intervenue au cours des phases 2 et 3 et le remplissage de la vessie natatoire a débuté à J 13 ou J 14. Le degré de mobilité de l’embryon libre, peu élevé et stable au cours des 5 premiers jours, a ensuite augmenté de façon régulière pour atteindre les valeurs les plus élevées entre J 14 et J 16. La présente étude met en évidence pour la répartition spatiale, la posture et la mobilité de l’embryon libre l’existence d’une séquence temporelle plus complexe et plus variable que ne le suggéraient les connaissances antérieures...|$|E
