Simplified liquid oxygen propellant conditioning concepts are being sought for future launch vehicles. During a joint program, four alternative propellant conditioning options were studied: (1) passive recirculation; (2) low bleed through the engine; (3) recirculation lines; and (4) <b>helium</b> <b>bubbling.</b> The test configuration {{for this program}} {{was based on a}} vehicle design which used a main recirculation loop that was insulated on the downcomer and uninsulated on the upcomer. This produces a natural convection recirculation flow. The test article for this program simulated a feedline which ran from the main recirculation loop to the turbopump. The objective was to measure the temperature profile of this test article. Several parameters were varied from the baseline case to determine their effects on the temperature profile. These parameters included: flow configuration, feedline slope, heat flux, main recirculation loop velocity, pressure, bleed rate, <b>helium</b> <b>bubbling,</b> and recirculation lines. The heat flux, bleed rate, and recirculation configurations produced the greatest changes from the baseline temperature profile. However, the temperatures in the feedline remained subcooled.

40|$|The MSBR (Molten Salt Breeder Reactor) was an {{industrial}} project designed {{at the beginning}} of the seventies at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and based on Thorium. Just before, the MSRE worked very well during four years with molten fuel. The MSBR system, where a maximum breeding was wanted, included a graphite moderated core with the circulation of a 71. 7 %LiF- 16 %BeF 2 - 12 %ThF 4 - 0. 3 %UF 4 salt and a pyro-chemical reprocessing unit. To obtain a maximum breeding ratio, Protactinium was extracted and stored allowing decay out of the neutron flux. This required the entire salt volume to be reprocessed in ten days, the gaseous fission products and Minor Actinides being extracted continuously by <b>helium</b> <b>bubbling</b> and pyro-chemical methods. The doubling time was evaluated to around 25 years. The project has since been re-evaluated especially within the frame of the EURATOM concerted Action MOST. To have an acceptable global reactivity feedback coefficient, studies have shown various possibilities based on core geometry, neutron moderation ratio and salt composition. When requiring only a breeding ratio of one, it is possible to avoid continuous reprocessing and to strongly simplify it. These various options will be discussed. The detailed inventory will be given showing clearly the interest of the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor where the production of Americium and Curium is a factor of one hundred lower that for the U-Pu RNR. The amount of Uranium 232 which is always produced in the Thorium cycle will be calculated as well as its decay rate since its decay chain eventually results in a 2. 6 MeV γ –ray which may be used to detect and hence control the U 233 fuel movements. As the U 233 has to be produced in other reactors (PWR, RNR or other MSR), special cares have to be taken and will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Tungsten is {{a leading}} {{candidate}} material for the diverter in future nuclear fusion reactors. Previous experiments have demonstrated that surface defects and bubbles form in tungsten when ex- posed to helium and hydrogen plasmas, even at modest ion energies. In some regimes, between 1000 K and 2000 K, and for He energies below 100 eV, "fuzz" like features form. The mechanisms leading to these surfaces comprised of nanometer sized tungsten tendrils which include visible <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles</b> are not currently known. The role of <b>helium</b> <b>bubble</b> formation in tendril morphology could very likely be {{the starting point of}} these mechanisms. Using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of helium and hydrogen exposure in the initial formation mechanisms of tungsten "fuzz" are investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations are well suited to describe the time and length scales associated with initial formation of helium clusters that eventually grow to nano-meter sized <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles.</b> MD simulations also easily enable the modeling of a variety of surfaces such as single crystals, grain boundaries or "tendrils". While the sputtering yield of tungsten is generally low, previous observations of surface modification due to plasma exposure raise questions about the effects of surface morphology and sub-surface <b>helium</b> <b>bubble</b> populations on the sputtering behavior. Results of computational molecular dynamics are reported that investigate the influence of sub-surface <b>helium</b> <b>bubble</b> distributions on the sputtering yield of tungsten (100) and (110) surfaces induced by helium ion exposure in the range of 300 eV to 1 keV. The calculated sputtering yields are in reasonable agreement {{with a wide range of}} experimental data; but do not show any significant variation as a result of the pre-existing <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a number of sub-surface mechanisms leading to nanometer- sized "fuzz" in tungsten exposed to low-energy helium plasmas. We find that during the <b>bubble</b> formation process, <b>helium</b> clusters create self-interstitial defect clusters in tungsten by a trap mutation process, followed by the migration of these defects to the surface that leads to the formation of layers of adatom islands on the tungsten surface. As the helium clusters grow into nanometer sized bubbles, their proximity to the surface and extremely high gas pressures can cause them to rupture the surface thus enabling <b>helium</b> release. <b>Helium</b> <b>bubble</b> bursting induces additional surface damage and tungsten mass loss which varies depending on the nature of the surface. We then show tendril-like geometries have surfaces that are more resilient to <b>helium</b> clustering and <b>bubble</b> formation and rupture. Finally, the study includes hydrogen to reveal the effect of a mixed 90 %H- 10 %He plasma mix on the tungsten surface. We find that hydrogen greatly affects the tungsten surface, with a near surface hydrogen saturation layer, and that helium clusters still form and are attractive trapping sites for hydrogen. Molecular dynamics simulations have also investigated the effect of sub-surface <b>helium</b> <b>bubble</b> evolution on tungsten surface morphology. The helium bubble/tungsten surface interaction has been systematically studied to determine how parameters such as bubble shape and size, temperature, tungsten surface orientation and ligament thickness above the bubble impact bubble stability and surface evolution. The tungsten surface is roughened by a combination of adatom islands, craters and pinholes. The study provides insight into the mechanisms and conditions leading to various tungsten topology changes, most notably the formation of nanoscale fuzz. An atomistic study of the mechanisms behind initial phases of tungsten nano-fuzz growth has determined that tungsten surfaces are affected by sub-displacement energy helium and hydrogen fluxes through a series of mechanisms. Sub-surface <b>helium</b> atom clustering, <b>bubble</b> nucleation, growth and rupture lead to tungsten surface deformation. Helium clustering processes vary near grain boundaries or in tendril-like surface geometries. In the presence of hydrogen, these mechanisms are coupled with hydrogen surface saturation. Finally, further investigation to connect these atomistic mechanisms to nano-size tungsten fuzz growth is needed to get a comprehensive under- standing of the effects of low energy helium and hydrogen on tungsten...|$|R

However, hydrogen (H) and helium (He) produced by nuclear transmutation reaction in fusion reactor would influence the microstructure and mechanical properties greatly [2]. On the basis of atom, He with low solubility affects greatly. He could promote irradiation hardening/embrittlement as well as segregation and void swelling [3, 4]. In addition, the potential synergistic effect of helium and hydrogen need further study during irradiation [5]. Research on irradiation hardening of V- 4 Ti after He+H irradiation indicated that He bubbles could not form in V- 4 Ti when the He concentration was less than 0.5  at.%. Therefore, the irradiation hardening for V- 4 Ti with H and He could mainly be defects formed during irradiation [6]. It is necessary to study the effect of high He and H concentrations on microstructures and hardening, in other words, how responsible the dislocation loops/nets and bubbles for the irradiation hardening.

[7] studied the influence of Au ion irradiation damage on helium-implanted tungsten, used Orowan stress formula [8] to interpret the interaction between <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles</b> and irradiation defects in tungsten materials and found <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles</b> as impenetrable obstacles for the dislocation motion, and thought the density and size of <b>helium</b> <b>bubbles</b> were the key factors for hardening. Irradiation defects would also produce during irradiation. The relationship among defects, dislocation loops and bubbles needs further consideration.|$|R
