A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and <b>fingerprinting</b> would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens.

In addition, different from the manual approach for <b>fingerprint</b> recognition by experts, the <b>fingerprint</b> recognition here is referred as <b>Fingerprint</b> Recognition System, which is program-based. <b>Fingerprint</b> verification is to verify the authenticity of one person by his <b>fingerprint.</b> The user provides his <b>fingerprint</b> together with his identity information like his ID number.

40|$|Conventional {{algorithms}} for <b>fingerprint</b> recognition {{are mainly}} based on minutiae information. However, {{the small number}} of minutiae in partial <b>fingerprints</b> is still a challenge in <b>fingerprint</b> matching. In <b>fingerprint</b> recognition systems, there are frequently appeared partial <b>fingerprints,</b> such as incompletely touching in <b>fingerprint</b> scanning or latent <b>fingerprints.</b> In this paper, we studied the influence of the <b>fingerprint</b> area in partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition. First, a simulation scheme was proposed to construct a serial of partial <b>fingerprints</b> with different area. Then, the influence of the <b>fingerprint</b> area in partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition is studied. By comparing the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition with different <b>fingerprint</b> area, some useful conclusions can be drawn: (1) The decrease of the <b>fingerprint</b> area degrades the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition; (2) When the <b>fingerprint</b> area decreases, the genuine matching scores will decrease, whereas the im-poster matching scores will increase; (3) When the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> is smaller than 20, 000 pixels (about fifth of the normal full <b>fingerprints),</b> the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition becomes very poor; (4) The threshold value of a given false accept rate increases when the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> decrease a lot, but it remains almost the same if the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> decrease not so much, e. g., greater than 50, 000 pixels (about half of the normal full <b>fingerprint).</b> These observations can be helpful in improving the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fingerprint images {{generally}} contain {{either a}} single <b>fingerprint</b> (e. g., rolled images) or {{a set of}} nonoverlapped <b>fingerprints</b> (e. g., slap <b>fingerprints).</b> However, there are situations where several <b>fingerprints</b> overlap {{on top of each}} other. Such situations are frequently encountered when latent (partial) <b>fingerprints</b> are lifted from crime scenes or residue <b>fingerprints</b> are left on <b>fingerprint</b> sensors. Overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> constitute a serious challenge to existing <b>fingerprint</b> recognition algorithms, since these algorithms are designed under the assumption that <b>fingerprints</b> have been properly segmented. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to separate overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> into component or individual <b>fingerprints.</b> The basic idea is to first estimate the orientation field of the given image with overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> and then separate it into component orientation fields using a relaxation labeling technique. We also propose an algorithm to utilize <b>fingerprint</b> singularity information to further improve the separation performance. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm leads to good separation of overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> that leads to a significant improvement in the matching accuracy.

40|$|Securing a stored <b>fingerprint</b> {{image is}} of {{paramount}} importance because a compromised <b>fingerprint</b> cannot be easily revoked. In this work, an input <b>fingerprint</b> image is mixed with another <b>fingerprint</b> (e. g., from a different finger), in order to produce a new mixed image that obscures the identity of the original <b>fingerprint.</b> Mixing <b>fingerprints</b> creates a new entity that looks like a plausible <b>fingerprint</b> and, thus, (a) it can be processed by conventional <b>fingerprint</b> algorithms and (b) an intruder {{may not be able to}} determine if a given print is mixed or not.

5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA <b>fingerprinting.</b> DNA <b>fingerprinting</b> of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fingerprints</b> are a {{non-invasive}} biometric that possess significant advantages. However, {{they are}} subject to surface erosion and damage; distortion upon scanning; and are vulnerable to <b>fingerprint</b> spoofing. The internal <b>fingerprint</b> exists as the undulations of the papillary junction - an intermediary layer of skin - and provides a solution to these disadvantages. Optical coherence tomography is used to capture the internal <b>fingerprint.</b> A depth profile of the papillary junction throughout the OCT scans is first constructed using fuzzy c-means clustering and a fine-tuning procedure. This information is then used to define localised regions over which to average pixels for the resultant internal <b>fingerprint.</b> When compared to a ground-truth internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone, the internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone detected automatically is within the measured bounds of human error. With a mean- squared-error of 21. 3 and structural similarity of 96. 4 %, the internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone was successfully found and described. The extracted <b>fingerprints</b> exceed their surface counterparts with respect to orientation certainty and NFIQ scores (both of which are respected <b>fingerprint</b> quality assessment criteria). Internal to surface <b>fingerprint</b> correspondence and internal <b>fingerprint</b> cross correspondence were also measured. A larger scanned region is shown to be advantageous as internal <b>fingerprints</b> extracted from these scans have good surface correspondence (75 % had at least one true match with a surface counterpart).
