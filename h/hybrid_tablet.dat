50|$|The first netbook {{offering}} by Gigabyte, the M912, is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>tablet</b> device able {{to function}} in both a standard laptop arrangement or, by twisting the screen, {{able to function}} as a Tablet PC device. It features an Intel Atom processor and comes preloaded with either Windows XP, Windows Vista or a customised Linux distribution. The hardware varies slightly depending on the OS chosen. The Linux Version for example does not include Bluetooth and has a lower resolution screen. Press accounts suggest that there may be significant heat and speed issues compared with other netbooks. Other criticisms focus on Gigabyte's choice to ship one variant with Windows Vista Home Basic, which lacks official Tablet PC support.|$|E
50|$|Positioned as {{a direct}} {{competitor}} to Apple's iPad line, Surface included several notable features, including a folding kickstand, which allows the tablet to stand at some angles, {{and the ability to}} attach optional protective covers that incorporate keyboards. Surface served as the launch device for Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8 that was designed for devices based on ARM architecture. Windows RT contains notable differences and limitations compared to Windows 8, including several removed features, being bundled with a special edition of Microsoft Office 2013 Home & Student, and, besides software included with the operating system, being incompatible with desktop software that runs on Windows 8 for personal computers and tablets with Intel compatible processors. Windows RT can only run Metro-style apps obtained from Windows Store. However visually resembling Surface Pro 2-in-1 detachable, Surface is not considered a 2-in-1 PC, being in fact a variant of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>tablet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The TC1100 has a 10.4 inch LCD {{display and}} {{pressure-sensitive}} pen that shares {{the same basic}} design as its predecessor, the TC1000. It has a design {{often referred to as}} a <b>hybrid</b> <b>tablet,</b> as it has the properties of both a convertible and slate tablet. All the necessary hardware components are stored within the casing of the display and digitizer. This allows it to work with or without a keyboard attached. With the keyboard attached, it {{can be used as a}} laptop, with the display rising by an adjustable hinge behind the keyboard. By rotating the display, the keyboard can fold inside the unit; or the keyboard can be removed entirely. Either method lets the user write on the screen easily, using a virtual keyboard or handwriting-recognition application for occasional character entry. This versatility gave the product a loyal following when there were no similar designs on the market.|$|E

The machine looks great, it's light and easy to hold, and the battery lasts all day. Users who simply want to browse the web or run basic productivity applications will be best served by this <b>hybrid</b> <b>tablet,</b> but those users also probably won't need a $740 Windows 8 machine either. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 targets an audience that wants more productivity options that what an iPad or Windows 7 netbook offer.

Additionally, users who do not opt for the $120 keyboard dock will find the device's productivity greatly hindered." ...|$|E
40|$|The MoBüD 1 {{consortium}} aims {{to develop}} a device concept and an infrastructure for mobile citizen services. Citizen consultants will be enabled to go to public places such as hospitals, senior citizen residences, markets, or day-care centres {{in order to provide}} services just as stationary offices of citizen services do. This approach combines aspects of e-government services as well as the idea of a central administrative contact point (“one-stop office”). The useful combination of these approaches reflects our understanding of a sufficient, currently feasible m-government service. Besides administrative and legal aspects (i. e. security requirements) that have {{to be taken into account}} and considerations regarding the cost-effectiveness of a service described, a user-centred approach is crucial for the success of a mobile citizen service. In order {{to develop a}} service that is acceptable for both, citizens and citizen consultants, a number of activities for gathering the necessary requirements were carried out. These activities include interviews and observations within the consultants ’ work environment, the development of scenarios, and experiments with different device settings, i. e. Tablet PCs with different screen sizes and input facilities. The investigations revealed that a <b>hybrid</b> <b>Tablet</b> PC, that comes with a keyboard best adapts to user’s requirements. The results could be verified so far by more complex laboratory experiments where comprehensive tasks (connecting to the administrative network, change of personal data, downloading forms and mobile payment for services) were tested with the device concept. Field trials are planned for the near future...|$|E

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} are the dominant {{energy storage system}} in the market today. Based on its high energy density, power density and ideal cycleability, research on lithium ion batteries has gone through several generations in a short timeframe. However, the constantly increasing demand for this portable energy source, {{which could be used}} for <b>hybrid</b> electric vehicles, <b>tablets,</b> computers, phones and even micro-electronics for medical apparatus and instruments, drives the design of next generation materials and designs with improved performance and safety. In this thesis, the influence of conductivity on Lithium-ion battery half cell capacity retention was investigated with graphite and NiO anodes, and a LiCoO 2 cathode, which were fabricated with different amounts of conductive carbon addition. Half cells with more conductive carbon highly improved performance in terms of both energy density and cycleability. The high carbon addition active materials were then used to fabricate graphite/LiCoO 2 and NiO/LiCoO 2 full cells which showed good performance – especially the NiO/ LiCoO 2 full cell which has more than 100 mAh g- 1 capacity left after 25 cycles. This has not been reported in the literature previously. All active materials and fabricated cells were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge measurements. Comparing with half cells, full cell fabrication and testing has more difficulties to achieve good performance. Some of the important variables are: cell conductivity, lithium ion source, increased side reactions and cut off voltage. For instance, in half cells, the lithium metal counter electrode is an unlimited lithium source with highest energy density, meaning that small parasitic chemical losses in Li are not observed; however, in full cells there is a finite amount of lithium contained in the cathode during assembly and full cell performance is therefore very sensitive to this unwanted reactions. Carbon is the most common commercial lithium battery anode material today because of its good conductivity and stability. However, the demands of new automotive and grid-scale applications are driving the need for new materials with higher energy density, but maintain the low cost and reliable safety of existing materials. Metal oxides are a promising alternative class of materials currently under development because of the possibility to achieve more than twice the storage capacity of graphite; however, very little work has been done in the literature regarding metal oxide full cells. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis is to develop a methodology for creating stable full cell lithium ion batteries with a metal oxide, NiO, anode and commercial LiCoO 2 cathode. Particularly, the effects of the electrode recipe, lower full cell cut off voltage, and capacity match between the anode and cathode on the capacity retention are illustrated...|$|R
