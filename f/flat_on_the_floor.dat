25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of warps and wefts {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|In November 1993, Sega {{released}} the Sega Activator, an octagonal device that lies <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and translates the player's physical movements into game inputs. [...] Several high-profile games, including Mortal Kombat and , were adapted {{to support the}} peripheral. [...] The device was a commercial failure, due mainly to its inaccuracy and its high price point. IGN editor Craig Harris ranked the Sega Activator the third worst video game controller ever made.|$|E
500|$|On {{their return}} to port, the British naval vessels worked to assist the Pigot, which had been grounded; {{in the process of}} doing so, they came under fire from an American battery on shore (which, by at least one account, {{included}} cannon-launched stone and spare iron) and suffered additional casualties (three killed and one wounded according to one account). The Pigot also sustained significant damage from the American battery. Some accounts describe the American prisoner (an elderly man named Richard Borden) as being aboard one of the boats coming under fire; these accounts describe the prisoner seeking shelter by laying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the vessel, despite attempts of his captors to have him stand (perhaps to try to dissuade the attackers); according to these accounts, one or two of the captors were eventually hit by shots from the Americans on shore. The prisoner was eventually released several days later. [...] In addition to the casualties at Bristol Ferry, the British suffered two killed and five wounded in the battle at Freetown, while the Americans suffered no casualties beyond the one captive, who apparently emerged without any noteworthy injury.|$|E

2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with feet <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{official}} {{review of the}} album from AllMusic gave it 4 out of 5 stars, on par with what they gave her debut. The site classified the album as [...] "completely contemporary country", and said [...] "the remarkable thing about Carnival Ride is that it's stronger song for song than Some Hearts." [...] They also praised the album for having [...] "the appearance of a genuine heart, something that no other big country-pop album has had since {{the glory days of}} Come On Over." [...] USA Today also praised the album for its versatility saying [...] "The songs call for vulnerability (You Won’t Find This), urgency (<b>Flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floor),</b> sympathy (Crazy Dreams, her co-written salute to “the hairbrush singers and dashboard drummers” from whose ranks she sprang), humor (The More Boys I Meet, the tag line of which goes “The more I love my dog”) and extreme role-playing (Last Name’s saga of a bar pickup that turns into an impulsive Vegas marriage). She delivers on all counts." [...] The Boston Herald gave the album a B, and claimed, [...] "Underwood manages enough spunk to occasionally avoid the cookie-cutter, especially with the curious beat-box-meets-banjo arrangement of [...] "Get Out of This Town" [...] and [...] "Just a Dream," [...] a bona fide [...] about a young war widow." ...|$|E
