40|$|Full {{factorial}} breeding {{designs are}} useful for quantifying the amount of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance that explain phenotypic traits. Such variance estimates are important for examining evolutionary potential. Traditionally, full <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> designs have been analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance, which may produce negative variance values and is not suited for unbalanced designs. Mixed-effects models do not produce negative variance values and are suited for unbalanced designs. However, extracting the variance components, calculating significance values, and estimating confidence intervals and/or power values for the components are not straightforward using traditional analytic methods. We introduce fullfact – an R package that addresses these issues and facilitates the analysis of full <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> designs with mixed-effects models. Here, we summarize {{the functions of the}} fullfact package. The observed data functions extract the variance explained by random and fixed effects and provide their significance. We then calculate the additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance components explaining the phenotype. In particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for estimating these components for nonnormal data types. The resampled data functions are used to produce bootstrap-t confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple function. We explore the fullfact package through a worked example. This package will facilitate the analyses of full <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> designs in R, especially for the analysis of binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability to incorporate additional random and fixed effects and power analyses...|$|E

One reason for the difficulty in detecting indirect benefits of polyandry may be that these are subtle and are mediated by environmental effects, such as maternal effects. Maternal effects may be especially important if females allocate resources to their offspring depending {{on the characteristics of}} their mating partners. We test this hypothesis in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, a species that provides extensive and direct parental care to offspring. We used a fully <b>factorial</b> design and <b>mated</b> females to one, two, three, four or five different males and manipulated conditions so that their offspring received reduced (12 h) or full (ca 72 h) maternal care. We found that average offspring fitness increased with full maternal care but there was no significant effect of polyandry or the interaction between the duration of maternal care and the level of polyandry on offspring fitness. Thus, although polyandry could provide a mechanism for biasing paternity towards high quality or compatible males, and variation in parental care matters, we found no evidence that female N. vespilloides gain indirect benefits by using parental care to bias the allocation of resources under different mating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} non-random mating on genetic {{response}} was compared for populations with discrete generations. Mating followed a selection step {{where the average}} coancestry of selected animals was constrained, while genetic response was maximised. Minimum coancestry (MC), Minimum coancestry with a maximum of one offspring per mating pair (MC 1) and Minimum variance of the relationships of offspring (MVRO) mating schemes resulted in a delay in inbreeding of about two generations compared with Random, Random <b>factorial</b> and Compensatory <b>mating.</b> In these breeding schemes where selection constrains the rate of inbreeding, ΔF, the improved family structure due to non-random mating increased genetic response. For schemes with ΔF constrained to 1. 0 % and 100 selection candidates, genetic response was 22 % higher for the MC 1 and MVRO schemes compared with Random mating schemes. For schemes with a less stringent constraint on ΔF or more selection candidates, {{the superiority of the}} MC 1 and MVRO schemes was smaller (5 – 6 %). In general, MC 1 seemed to be the preferred mating method, since it almost always yielded the highest genetic response. MC 1 mainly achieved these high genetic responses by avoiding extreme relationships among the offspring, i. e. fullsib offspring are avoided, and by making the contributions of ancestors to offspring more equal by mating least related animals. </p...|$|R

Superior position of maize is due to his very wide and variety utilisation and because of that, the main goal of all maize breeding programs is to obtain new inbred lines and hybrids that will outperform the existing hybrids with respect to a number of traits. For efficient selection of grain yield, like the most important economic trait, in regard to its on the great influence the environmental factors, has complex mode of inheritance and low heritability, is necessary to know relation between grain yield and morphological traits which are influencing on the grain yield.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundIn {{traditional}} family-based aquaculture breeding, each sire is mated to two dams {{in order}} to separate the sire’s genetic effect from other family effects. <b>Factorial</b> <b>mating</b> involves more mates per sire and/or dam and result in more but smaller full- and/or half-sib families. For traits measured on sibs of selection candidates, <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> increases intensity of selection between families when selection is on traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimated breeding values (TRAD-EBV). However, selection on genome-wide estimated breeding values (GW-EBV), uses both within- and between-family effects and the advantage of <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> is less obvious. Our aim was to compare by computer simulation the impact of various <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> strategies for truncation selection on TRAD-EBV versus GW-EBV on rates of inbreeding, accuracy of selection and genetic gain for two traits, i. e. one measured on selection candidates (CAND-TRAIT) and one on their sibs (SIB-TRAIT). ResultsSire:dam mating ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 2 or 10 : 10 were tested with 100, 200 or 1000 families produced from a constant number of parents (100 sires and 100 dams), and a mating ratio of 1 : 2 with 200 families produced from 100 sires and 200 dams. With GW-EBV, changing the mating ratio from 1 : 1 to 10 : 10 had a limited effect on genetic gain (less than 5  %) for both CAND-TRAIT and SIB-TRAIT, whereas with TRAD-EBV, selection intensity increased for SIB-TRAIT and genetic gain increased by 41 and 77  % for schemes with 3000 and 12, 000 selection candidates, respectively. For both GW-EBV and TRAD-EBV, rates of inbreeding decreased by up to ~ 30  % when the mating ratio was changed from 1 : 1 to 10 : 10 for schemes with 3000 to 12, 000 selection candidates. Similar results were found for alternative heritabilities of SIB-TRAIT and total number of tested sibs. ConclusionsChanging the sire:dam mating ratio from 1 : 1 to 10 : 10 increased genetic gain substantially with TRAD-EBV, mainly through increased selection intensity for the SIB-TRAIT, whereas with GW-EBV, it had a limited effect on genetic gain for both traits.

Each family in G 1 and G 2 was split and reared using communal early rearing (CER) or separate early rearing (SER) methods. Seven microsatellite loci were used for parentage assignment in the CER groups: 96. 8 % of the offspring (1284 individuals) and 96. 2 % offspring (1342 individuals) were unambiguously assigned to 113 families in the G 1 and 92 families in the G 2 generations, respectively.

Genotypes at four to ten nuclear-encoded microsatellites were used for parentage assignment and a general, linear-mixed model and a Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) algorithm were used to estimate variance components associated with dam, sire, and dam x sire interaction effects. Dam and sire effect on juvenile growth (weight, length and growth rates) were significant, whereas dam by sire interaction effect was not. Estimates of broad-sense heritability for growth, based on family means (h 2 f), in dams ranged from 0. 60 ? 0. 20 to 0. 82 ? 0. 10 and in sires ranged from 0. 43 ? 0. 20 to 0. 75 ? 0. 18. High correlations were found between growth rates measured at two time intervals. Estimates of general combining ability for growth rates differed significantly among dams and among sires, whereas estimates of specific combining ability for each dam ? sire combination {{did not differ significantly}} from zero. These results suggest that additive-effect genes contributed to the differences in juvenile growth.

The primary source of this parental contribution has been attributed to maternal effects and evidence for paternal effects is equivocal. Maternal effects are a non-genetic contribution of a female to its offspring but most reported maternal effects are products of both genetic and non-genetic contributions, i. e. female effects. In this study, parental effects on traits of larvae of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) at hatch were investigated at one temperature using a 5 × 3 <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> design (North Carolina Design II).

Maternal effects were detected in larval weight and yolk-sac volume, while paternal and, hence, genetic effects appeared in larval length, yolk-sac volume, RNA : DNA ratio, and lapillar area.

Maternal genetic and environmental effects were greatest at 75 days of age, accounting for 9. 1 % of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 11. 4 % of variance in standard length and 8. 8 % of variance in total length. At later ages maternal effects were much reduced, explaining 0. 8 - 3. 7 % of phenotypic variance in growth traits. Additive genetic effects were greatest at 130 days of age, when they accounted for 17. 4 % of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 21. 4 % of variance in standard length and 18. 7 % of variance in total length. Additive genetic effects were negligible (< 1 %) at 75 days of age and 4. 8 - 5. 5 % of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 180 days of age. Non-additive genetic effects (which also included common environmental effects because of families being raised in the same tank) explained 5. 8 - 7. 3 % of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 75 days of age, but were much smaller at later ages. Variable stocking densities among tanks up to 75 days significantly affected all growth trait measurements below 180 days of age...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Yakima/Klickitat Fisheries Program (YKFP) has {{designed}} a supplementation program {{to enhance the}} spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Yakima Basin. The purpose of the YKFP is to test the assumption that new artificial production {{can be used to}} increase harvest and natural production while maintaining the long-term genetic fitness of the fish population being supplemented and keeping adverse genetic and ecological interactions with non-target species or stocks within acceptable limits. This paper describes the design and operation of a production scale supplementation facility from broodstock collection protocols, through the <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> schemes, incubation, rearing experiments, and volitional release of 810, 000 smolts from three acclimation sites. The experimental design includes testing new Semi-Natural rearing Treatments (SNT) against the Optimum Conventional Treatments (OCT) of existing successful hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest. Monitoring efforts are directed at evaluation of the performance of supplementation fish in each of the following categories, and comparison with the performance of naturally reared fish. 1. The post-release survival of supplementation fish (both outmigrating smolts and returning adults). 2. The homing and reproductive success of supplemented populations. 3. The long-term fitness of supplemented populations. 4. The inter- and intra-specific interactions (including competition, predation and genetic effects) between supplemented and unsupplemented populations. Information resulting from this research can be used by resource managers to improve the survival and performance of hatchery reared salmonids.

40|$|Chantier qualité GASkeletal {{deformities}} {{are important}} traits for aqua-culture as they induce slow growing and low market value. We studied their genetic determinism and {{their interactions with}} the environment at the ongrowing stage in 5839 European sea bass from a partial <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> of 33 sires and 23 dams, reared in four sites. All families were mixed, and fish were first reared in one site (site B) until 35 g mean weight, then distributed to the four sites. A posteriori reconstruction of pedigree with microsatellites was used. Deformities were scored internally at slaughtering, and externally from photographs. Site B, where all fish were initially stocked until 35 g and exposed to forced swimming because of fast water current showed {{the highest rate of}} deformities with 83 % and 65 % from internal and external scoring respectively. Heritability on the underlying scale wash 2 = 0. 25 ± 0. 03 across all sites, and varied little between sites, while genetic correlations of deformities between sites were always high (> 0. 85). Genetic correlations between deformities and daily growth coefficient were variable between sites(rA= 0. 50 ± 0. 09, 0. 43 ± 0. 10, 0. 32 ± 0. 10, 0. 18 ± 0. 10 for sites A, B, C, D respectively) and were positively linked with the average growth rate in each site. These results pointed out {{that there could be a}} relation between growth rate and the evolution of deformities at the grow-out stage...|$|E
40|$|Lignin {{is a major}} {{chemical}} compound of wood {{and one of the}} most abundant organic biopolymers on earth. It accumulates in the secondary cell wall of xylem cells and is a major target for tree breeders because of its foreseen role in the emerging bioeconomy. In this study, we paved the way toward an accelerated domestication of a widely grown tree species, Eucalyptus urophylla, by molecular breeding. To this end, we first described the pattern of nucleotide variation occurring at seven structural and regulatory genes of the lignin biosynthesis pathway and found high levels of average nucleotide and haplotype diversity per gene (?? =? 0. 0065 and Hd?=? 0. 853). Then, taking advantage of a pre-existing <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> design, a candidate-gene-based quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection strategy was used to compare the variation of lignin quality (syringyl by guaiacyl ratio (S/G)) with the nucleotidic variability in these seven genes in 304 genotypes belonging to 33 connected full-sib families. Two genes, encoding cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) and a Rho-like GTPase (ROP 1), were shown to be linked to the variation of S/G through different single and multi-locus single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) - and haplotype-based association methods. Providing that relevant candidate genes are selected and their patterns of nucleotide diversity is accurately described, we showed that quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) can be detected taking advantage of pre-existing field experiments and trait measurements gathered in the framework of a forest tree breeding program.

40|$|Supplementary data to {{this article}} can be found online at [URL] {{parameters}} for carcass and fillet percentage were estimated in 760 European sea bass reared under commercial conditions and slaughtered at 573 days post fertilization (395 g mean body weight). Phenotyped fish were the offspring of 45 sires and 20 dams crossed in a <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> design. Pedigrees were re-constructed with 90. 7 % success using 12 microsatellites. The heritability of fillet yield was moderately low (0. 21), while it was high for carcass yield (0. 57). Both traits were poorly correlated (− 0. 01 to 0. 28) making space for their combined improvement. We investigated different predictors derived from measurement of surfaces on digital pictures and ultrasound measurements at several points of the body. The accuracy of the phenotypic prediction was rather low for fillet yield (r 2 = 0. 02 – 0. 18), but higher for carcass yield (r 2 = 0. 27 – 0. 41). However, genetic correlations of predictors with the traits to predict were reasonably high (up to 0. 67 for fillet yield and 0. 95 for carcass yield), thus allowing to consider them for performing indirect individual selection instead of sib selection. However, {{it was difficult to}} design a predictor that would simultaneously increase fillet yield and carcass yield because of contradicting effects of relative head size, {{an important component of the}} predictors which was positively correlated to carcass yield but not to fillet yield...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Genetic {{parameters}} for carcass quality traits were estimated in 27 families of sea bass (3 dams × 9 sires <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> design), raised mixed {{in the same}} tanks starting before hatching. Offspring parentage was determined a posteriori using 6 microsatellite loci. Carcass quality traits were recorded at 818 days post fertilization (mean standard length: 32. 6 ± 3. 1 cm). Genetic parameters were estimated from the sire half sib variance and covariance components. Heritability of body weight (BW) and carcass processing traits (standardized to body weight) percent head weight (Head%), percent viscera weight (Viscera%) and percent visceral fat weight (VisceFat%) were relatively high ranging from 0. 48 ± 0. 15 (Viscera%) to 0. 87 ± 0. 23 (Head%); the estimate of heritability for fillet yield (Fillet%) was lower (0. 25 ± 0. 10) but was significantly greater than zero. Body weight was positively correlated to Fillet%, Viscera%, and VisceFat%, and negatively correlated to Head%. These results indicate that these carcass processing traits can be mod-ified by directional selection and that selection for greater BW would {{lead to an increase}} of Fillet%, Viscera % and VisceFat % and a decrease of Head%. Muscle lipid content (MuscleLipid%) was determined using two indirect methods: measurements with a Torry Fish Fatmeter (TorryLipid) and determination of the percentage of dry matter content (MuscleDry%) via desiccation. Both measures were highly correlated to chemical measurements of MuscleLipid%. Regression analysis indicated a superior predictive value of TorryLipid suggesting that MuscleLipid % may be evaluated via rapid, non lethal measurement...|$|E
40|$|Viral Nervous Necrosis (VNN) {{disease is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most serious threats for European sea bass cultured in Mediterranean Sea, with no simple and effective procedures to treat this disease. In this study, 1472 offspring resulting from artificial full <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> of western Mediterranean dams with sires from four different wild populations of European sea bass (Northern Atlantic, NAT; Western Mediterranean, WEM; Northern-East Mediterranean, NEM; and Southern-East Mediterranean, SEM) were challenged by experimental infection to W 80 betanodavirus strain in order to evaluate genetic variations for VNN resistance among populations and genetic correlations between VNN resistance and production traits. The results showed a large variation of VNN resistance between the four populations tested as well as between sire families within strain. The survivals between pure wild populations SEM, NEM, WEM and NAT were estimated at 99 %, 94 %, 62 %, and 44 %, respectively. A moderate intra-population heritability of VNN resistance, calculated based on liability scale with sire model, was recorded for the first time in European sea bass (h 2 u = 0. 26 ± 0. 11). Finally, moderate negative genetic correlations between VNN resistance and daily growth coefficient (DGC) and body weight (BW) were also demonstrated (− 0. 28 ± 0. 20, − 0. 35 ± 0. 14, respectively) while the genetic correlation between resistance to VNN and fillet adiposity (FA) was weakly negative and not significant (− 0. 13 ± 0. 19). These results give good prospects of selective breeding of European sea bass for improved resistance to VNN disease...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the genetic basis of coping style in European seabass, fish from a full <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> (10 females x 50 males) were reared in common garden and individually tagged. Individuals coping style was characterized through behavior tests at four different ages, categorizing fish into proactive or reactive: a hypoxia avoidance test (at 255 days post hatching, dph) and 3 risk-taking tests (at 276, 286 and 304 dph). We observed significant heritability of the coping style, {{higher for the}} average of risk-taking scores (h 2 = 0. 45 ± 0. 14) than for the hypoxia avoidance test (h 2 = 0. 19 ± 0. 10). The genetic correlations between the three risk-taking scores were very high (rA = 0. 96 - 0. 99) showing that although their repeatability was moderately high (rP = 0. 64 - 0. 72), successive risk-taking tests evaluated the same genetic variation. A mild genetic correlation between {{the results of the}} hypoxia avoidance test and the average of risk-taking scores (0. 45 ± 0. 27) suggested that hypoxia avoidance and risk-taking tests do not address exactly the same behavioral and physiological responses. Genetic correlations between weight and risk taking traits showed negative values whatever the test used in our population i. e. reactive individual weights were larger. The results of this quantitative genetic analysis suggest a potential for the development of selection programs based on coping styles that could increase seabass welfare without altering growth performances. Overall, it also contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the origin and the significance of individual behavioral differences...|$|E
40|$|The genome {{sequence}} of apple (Malus 6 domestica Borkh.) was {{published more than}} a year ago, which helped develop an 8 K SNP chip to assist in implementing genomic selection (GS). In apple breeding programmes, GS can be used to obtain genomic breeding values (GEBV) for choosing next-generation parents or selections for further testing as potential commercial cultivars at a very early stage. Thus GS has the potential to accelerate breeding efficiency significantly because of decreased generation interval or increased selection intensity. We evaluated the accuracy of GS in a population of 1120 seedlings generated from a <b>factorial</b> <b>mating</b> design of four females and two male parents. All seedlings were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium chip comprising 8, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and were phenotyped for various fruit quality traits. Random-regression best liner unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) and the Bayesian LASSO method were used to obtain GEBV, and compared using a cross-validation approach for their accuracy to predict unobserved BLUP-BV. Accuracies were very similar for both methods, varying from 0. 70 to 0. 90 for various fruit quality traits. The selection response per unit time using GS compared with the traditional BLUP-based selection were very high (. 100 %) especially for low-heritability traits. Genome-wide average estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent SNPs was 0. 32, with a relatively slow decay of LD in the long range (r 2 = 0. 33 and 0. 19 at 100 kb and 1, 000 kb respectively), contributing to the higher accuracy of GS.
