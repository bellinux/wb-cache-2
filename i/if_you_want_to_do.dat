500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, of course, was easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday". [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of the}} four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." ...|$|E
500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E

500|$|A Royal Stag ad in 2011 {{featuring}} Harbhajan Singh, {{showed him}} opting to {{not work in}} his father's ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. The commercial ends with him asking the viewer, if with his achievements, [...] "Have I made it large?" [...] Royal Stag's rival, United Spirits Ltd's McDowell's No. 1 Platinum whisky mocked the ad in its commercial featuring Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The ad showed Harbhajan look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father's factory, asking if he had [...] "made it large", only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Dhoni then tells the viewer, [...] "Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar" [...] (<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something in life, then forget large, do something different [...] ).

[...] Harbhajan served a legal notice to United Spirits Ltd on 18 July 2011 claiming that the commercial mocked him, his family and the Sikh community. The notice was sent to Vijay Mallya, UB Executive vice-chairman SR Gupte, President & CFO Ravi Nedungadi, Deputy President Harish Bhat and Executive VP (Corporate Affairs) Nandini Verma. It was sent by Avtar Kaur, Harbhajan's mother, through his lawyers, Dewani Advocates & Consultants. Kaur stated these kinds of advertisements brought [...] "disunity and friction" [...] in the Indian cricket team and could be termed [...] "anti-national". The notice also demanded that the company publicly apologise to the family [...] "through widely-read newspapers as well as television channels prominently", remove the advertisement within three days of receiving the notice and compensation of [...] The United Breweries Group withdrew the ad on 22 July 2011 stating that had done so [...] "in the interest of the game of cricket" [...] and fearing that the commercial could be [...] "misused by vested interests to further their own agenda". The company also stated that the view of the management was that there was no maintainable case.|$|E

It became a bestseller. In March 2003, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water was the third-best-selling religious book in Britain and the fourth-best-selling religious book in Scotland. In his book God Can't Sleep: Waiting for Daylight On Life's Dark Nights, Palmer Chinchen writes that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is an [...] "excellent book on faith". Religion News Service journalist Jonathan Merritt called the book a modern classic book. In 2002, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water received the Christianity Today Book Award in the Christian Living category. Carol Rodman of The Commercial Appeal called the book [...] "challenging". Willow Creek Community Church placed the book on its Essential Reading List.

Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E

The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's not going to pay you as much money, but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, that's your business.' He was very pissed that I decided to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E
