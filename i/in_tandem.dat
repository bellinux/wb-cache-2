5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell <b>in</b> <b>tandem,</b> whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E

5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set.

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} finding {{end-to-end}} delay bounds for single leaky-bucket shaped flows subject to FIFO multiplexing <b>in</b> <b>tandems</b> of rate-latency nodes. More specifically, we focus on a methodology, called the Least Upper Delay Bound (LUDB) method, which is based on Network Calculus. The latter has already been used for computing delay bounds <b>in</b> <b>tandems</b> <b>in</b> which the paths of the flows are subject to particular restrictions. In this paper we generalize and extend it to tandems traversed by flows following arbitrary paths. We show that such methodology yields better bounds than those obtained through both per-node analysis and comparable methods proposed in the literature...|$|R

5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying <b>in</b> <b>tandem.</b> The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E

5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that giant North American fruits of plants such as the Osage-orange, Kentucky coffeetree and honey locust evolved <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> with now-extinct American megafauna such as mammoths and other proboscideans, {{since there are no}} extant endemic herbivores able to ingest these fruits and disperse their seeds.

5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and <b>in</b> <b>tandem,</b> was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse.

5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
