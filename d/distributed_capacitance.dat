50|$|Another example where {{a simple}} {{one-dimensional}} model will not suffice is the windings of an inductor. Coils of wire have capacitance between adjacent turns (and also more remote turns as well, {{but the effect}} progressively diminishes). For a single layer solenoid, the <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitance</b> will mostly lie between adjacent turns {{as shown in figure}} 4 between turns T1 and T2, but for multiple layer windings and more accurate models <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitance</b> to other turns must also be considered. This model is fairly difficult to deal with in simple calculations {{and for the most part}} is avoided. The most common approach is to roll up all the <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitance</b> into one lumped element in parallel with the inductance and resistance of the coil. This lumped model works successfully at low frequencies but falls apart at high frequencies where the usual practice is to simply measure (or specify) an overall Q for the inductor without associating a specific equivalent circuit.|$|E

Existing measures set the shunt reactors at both ends of transmission lines to weaken the effect of <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitances.</b> But this approach shows some drawbacks when it is applied to distributed power plants. On the one hand, the shunt reactors reduce the power factor at the export side of distributed power plants.

40|$|Abstract：Power {{distribution}} onboard vessel {{is typically}} configured as ungrounded system {{due to the}} ability to continuously supply electric power even when an earth fault occurs. The impedance connections between 3 phase power lines and hull cause the line‐to‐hull voltages to become unstable and increased in case the impedances are unbalanced, bringing the situation susceptible to electric shock and deterioration of insulation material. Also the line‐to‐hull voltage can reach to a certain maximum value in the steady state depending on the <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitances</b> and grounding resistances between lines and hull.

Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a bipolar transistor on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|R
5000|$|However, if the {{propagation}} delay in a wire, PCB trace, cable, or connector is significant (for example, if the delay {{is greater than}} 1/6 of the rise time of the digital signal), the [...] "lumped" [...] circuit model is no longer valid and the interconnect has to be analyzed as a transmission line.

50|$|To {{minimize}} {{distortion of}} the pulse shape, a pulse transformer needs to have low values of leakage inductance and <b>distributed</b> <b>capacitance,</b> and a high open-circuit inductance. In power-type pulse transformers, a low coupling capacitance (between the primary and secondary) is important to protect the circuitry on the primary side from high-powered transients created by the load. For the same reason, high insulation resistance and high breakdown voltage are required. A good transient response is necessary to maintain the rectangular pulse shape at the secondary, because a pulse with slow edges would create switching losses in the power semiconductors.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; Distribution is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore the design options for a 1. 2 -m railgun power supply capable of {{accelerating}} a 150 -g to 250 -g projectile to 1000 m/s. In order to accomplish this task a MATLAB model will be constructed to conduct trade-off studies between various power supply configurations {{in an attempt to}} maximize the system performance. The final design shows that by <b>distributing</b> the system <b>capacitance</b> between four equal size banks and firing them sequentially the total system capacitance can be reduced by more than half. Because the capacitor banks are fired sequentially, the current pulse is length-ened resulting in more efficient use of the barrel. The final benefit of using a multiple-bank system is that the individual bank currents are reduced by a factor of four over the single-bank scenario. By reducing the bank currents solid-state switches are now an affordable option further improving the system performance. By applying a systematic approach to optimizing the power supply this study has shown that the energy required to accelerate a 172 -g projectile to 1000 m/s can be reduced from 1. 3 MJ in the single-bank scenario to 600 KJ by <b>distributing</b> the <b>capacitance</b> over four equal sized banks.
