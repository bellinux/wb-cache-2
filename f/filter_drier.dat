40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{pressure}} filtration and vacuum agitated drying on cellobiose octaacetate (COA) particles in methanol slurries were studied by making Raman measurements {{through the glass}} wall {{at the side of}} a <b>filter</b> <b>drier</b> beneath the oil jacket. The change in intensity of methanol peaks in the spectra allowed the removal of the solvent from the particle bed to be monitored. Also, drying curves for COA generated from the Raman measurements gave an indication of the changing physical status of the particle bed during continuous or intermittent agitation. The intensity of the Raman signal for COA depended on the bulk density of the particle bed, which changed due to aggregation and attrition that occurred during solvent removal and particle motion induced by agitation during vacuum drying. Loss on drying (LOD) measurements of samples removed {{at the end of the}} pressure filtration and vacuum agitated drying stages established the degree of wetness and confirmed the end point of drying (< 0. 5 % w/w solvent), respectively. Dynamic image analysis confirmed that minimum attrition of COA was achieved when (a) the majority of the methanol was removed during pressure filtration at 0. 5 bar N 2 and (b) intermittent agitation was applied during the vacuum drying stage...|$|E
40|$|Drying of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) is {{an energy}} {{intensive}} {{process that is}} often a manufacturing bottleneck due to its relatively long processing times. A key objective {{is the ability to}} determine the drying end point, the time at which all solvent has been evaporated from the solid cake. A novel method for determining the end point of pharmaceutical dryers, based on on-line mass spectrometry is developed and tested. The proposed method offers several advantages over existing spectrometric methods, including the ability to detect when the cake is dry from vapor phase measurements and a very simple implementation that does not require chemometric models. The drying end point was determined as the time at which the gas phase solvent concentration measurement from the mass spectrometer converged to a predicted value computed from a solvent mass balance on the oven assuming zero flow rate from the cake. The method was tested on a laboratory scale vacuum dryer over a range of temperatures and pressures using glass beads with three different particle sizes. The method was validated by performing Loss On Drying (LOD) experiments for one combination of pressure, temperature and bead size. The mass spectrometer (MS) was used as a Quality by Design (QbD) tool along with thermocouples to understand dynamics in vacuum tray drying. The data indicated that boiling was the dominant mechanism. A multiphase transport model to predict drying performance was developed. It was found that a two phase transport model with the vapor and solid considered as one phase and the liquid treated as the second phase was capable of qualitatively reproducing the drying dynamics. Adjustable model parameters estimated from experimental data collected over a range of operating conditions exhibited trends that provided further insight into drying behavior. The understanding of drying from a vacuum tray dryer was extended to an Agitated <b>Filter</b> <b>Drier</b> (AFD) using the MS. Further, one of the most challenging issues with the use of an AFD, particle size change, was investigated. The change in particle size of API during drying at different RPMs was studied. The experiments indicated that the process was dominated by breakage of API which showed strong correlation with LOD. Population balance models were used to estimate parameters and derive empirical relations to LOD levels...|$|E

50|$|Also {{sediment}} spill {{is better}} measured in transport {{than at the}} source. The sediment transport in open water is estimated by measuring the turbidity, correlating turbidity to sediment concentration (using a regression developed from water samples that are <b>filtered,</b> <b>dried,</b> and weighed), multiplying the concentration with the discharge as above, and integrating over the entire plume. To distinguish the spill contribution, the background turbidity is subtracted from the spill plume turbidity. Since the spill plume in open water varies in space and time, an integration over the entire plume is required, and repeated many times to get acceptably low uncertainty in the results. These measurements are made close to the source, {{in the order of}} a few hundred meters.|$|R
