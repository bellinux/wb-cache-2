2500|$|According to Noyce and Moore, {{as well as}} David Brock and Joel Shurkin, {{the shift}} from bipolar {{transistors}} to Shockley diodes was unexpected. Shockley initially planned {{to work on the}} mass production of <b>diffusion</b> bipolar <b>transistors,</b> but then set up a [...] "secret project" [...] on Shockley diodes, and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors. The reasons for this turn are unknown. According to Beckman's biographer, Shockley regarded his diode as an interesting scientific problem, and chose it, neglecting Beckman's commercial interests.|$|R
25|$|The group {{immediately}} set a clear goal {{to produce}} an array of silicon <b>diffusion</b> mesa <b>transistors</b> for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs. Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated. However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.|$|R

Strong correlation between leakage current of the devices and the electrical property of a single longitudinal grain boundary is observed.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{hierarchical}} technique, based on integer linear programming (ILP), to generate area-efficient layouts of relatively large complex CMOS {{cells in the}} twodimensional (2 -D or multi-row) style. First, the CMOS circuit is partitioned into subcircuits called clusters. Next, the set of all minimum-width 1 -D placements (chain covers) are generated for each cluster, and form the input to the ILP model. The model aims at selecting exactly one cover for each cluster such that the overall 2 -D cell width is minimized. In the process, all possible <b>diffusion</b> sharing between <b>transistor</b> chains belonging to clusters are considered; the inter-row connections {{that contribute to the}} overall cell width are also reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the technique reduces run times by several orders of magnitude over non-hierarchical methods, and yields optimal or near-optimal layouts in most cases. 1 Introduction Cell synthesis techniques can increase design productivity by automating t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|History {{and theory}} alike suggest that General Purpose Technologies (GPT's), {{such as the}} steam engine or electricity, may {{play a key role}} in {{economic}} growth. In a previous paper (Helpman and Trajtenberg, 1994) we incorporated this notion into a Grossman-Helpman growth model, and explored the economy-wide dynamics that a GPT generates. The present paper deals with the diffusion of the GPT over heterogeneous final-good sectors. We show that the gradual adoption of the GPT by each user sector generates a sequence of two-phased cycles, culminating in a bringing about a spell of sustained growth. We also analyze the welfare implications of the order of adoption, by way of numerical simulations.

The following paper describes a complete process in designing and fabricating a five micron Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Inverter device within a Class 1000 wafer fabrication area, utilizing Mead and Conway's lambda-base rules and diffusion techniques. A Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Inverter utilizes two separate transistors, a p-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor and a n-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor. The silicon substrate is an n-type, in which a p-well region is created by <b>diffusion.</b> The p-channel <b>transistor</b> is formed in the n-type silicon substrate, whereas the n-channel transistor is created in the p-well region, which performs as the backgate for the n-channel transistor.

40|$|Progress in {{semiconductor}} {{process technology}} has made SOI transistors {{one of the}} most promising candidates for high performance and low power designs. With smaller <b>diffusion</b> capacitances, SOI <b>transistors</b> switch significantly faster than their traditional bulk MOS counterparts and consume less power per switching. However, design and simulation of SOI MOS circuits is more challenging due to more complex behavior of an SOI transistor involving floating body effects, delay dependence on history of transistor switching, bipolar effect and others. This paper is devoted to developing a fast table model of SOI transistors, suitable for use in fast transistor level simulators. We propose using body charge instead of body potential as an independent variable of the model to improve convergence of circuit simulation integration algorithm. SOI transistor has one additional terminal compared with the bulk MOSFET and hence requires larger tables to model. We propose a novel transformation to reduce number of table dimensions and as a result to make the size of the tables reasonable. The paper also presents efficient implementation of our SOI transistor table model using piece-wise polynomial approximation, nonuniform grid discretization, and splitting the transistor model into the model of its equilibrium and non equilibrium states. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by employing it in a fast transistor level simulator to simulate high performance industrial SOI microprocessor circuits. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{different}} Single Event Latch-up (SEL) hardness techniques against radiation in {{a commercial}} 0. 35 µm technology from AMS. Techniques like increasing nMOS to pMOS distance, guard rings, source to N-well/P-substrate contact distance, increasing N-well size, source/drain <b>diffusion</b> area, <b>transistor</b> width as well as relative transistor orientation are investigated and tested to achieve a high SEL threshold. Several structures holding these techniques are made in two different options of AMS 0. 35 µm, one option with bulk (C 35 B 4 C 3) {{and the other with}} an exitaxial layer (C 35 B 4 O 1) in order to investigate the differences. The structures are based on the inverter {{in order to make the}} test structures as close to actual circuit design as possible. The inverter is also a favorable structure because it represents a worst case latch-up situation because of the parasitic components arising and the simple model needed to characterize it. The thesis also investigates whether using a pulsed laser module is suitable to investigate SEL susceptibility in favor of a particle accelerator. The structures were exposed to infrared (1064 nm) laser pulses in order to emulate high energy particles striking the ASIC. The use of laser beam with a spot size of 2 µm* 2 µm opened the possibility to choose which structure to expose with minimum impact on the nearby structures. By increasing the energy of the laser pulses, the SEL threshold of each structure could be determined by empirical testing. A digital input signal is propagated trough the structures in order to conﬁrm which structure experiences latch-up. A set of switches on the PCB is used to choose which structure to monitor. The current usage of the ASIC is monitored in order to detect latch-up and to log the latch-up current. Measurements presented a “threshold” distance between the contact and source of the transistors. If the contact-source distance is increased beyond 4. 5 µm the SEL threshold decreased about 70 % in the epitaxial device. In the bulk device, if the contact-source distance was increased beyond 2. 0 µm the SEL threshold decreased to a level 12 % beneath the reference structure. The most effective structure in the epitaxial device was the structure with the N-well/P-substrate contacts placed in between the transistors. This structure presented a 30 % decreased area and 87 % higher threshold than the structure with the lowest threshold. Though, only 2. 5 % higher threshold than second place and the same area. The most effective structure in the bulk device was the structure with nMOS source to pMOS source distance of 7. 4 µm and the minimum N-well/P-substrate contact to source distance of 0. 6 µm. This structure presented a 17 % decreased area, a 465 % higher SEL threshold and a 30 % higher SEL current in comparison to the reference structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates how {{fluorine}} implantation {{can be used}} {{to suppress}} boron diffusion in the base of a double polysil-icon silicon bipolar transistor and hence deliver a record of 110 GHz. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and transmis-sion electron microscopy (TEM) are used to characterize the effect of the fluorine implantation energy and dose, the anneal temper-ature and the germanium pre-amorphization implant on the fluo-rine profiles. These results show that retention of fluorine in the sil-icon is maximized when a high-energy fluorine implant is combined with a low thermal budget inert anneal. TEM images show that a high-energy fluorine implant into germanium pre-amorphized sil-icon eliminates the end of range defects from the germanium im-plant and produces a band of dislocation loops deeper in the sil-icon at the range of the fluorine implant. Boron SIMS profiles show a suppression of boron diffusion for fluorine doses at and above 5 10 14 cm 2, but no suppression at lower fluorine doses. This suppression of boron diffusion correlates with the appearance on the SIMS profiles of a fluorine peak at a depth of approximately 2, which is attributed to fluorine trapped in vacancy–fluorine clusters. The introduction of a fluorine implant at this critical flu-orine dose into a bipolar transistor process flow leads to an in-crease in cutoff frequency from 46 to 60 GHz. Further optimiza-tion of the base-width and the collector profile leads to a further increase in cutoff frequency to 110 GHz. Two factors are postu-lated to contribute to the suppression of boron diffusion by the fluorine implant. First, the elimination of the germanium end of range defects, and the associated interstitial population, by the flu-orine implant, removes a source of transient enhanced diffusion. Second, any interstitials released by the dislocation loops at the range of the fluorine implant would be expected to recombine at the vacancy–fluorine clusters before reaching the boron profile.
