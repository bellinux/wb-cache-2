In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal. The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension <b>of</b> time <b>judgments,</b> namely subjective <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage and what factors influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage: <b>the</b> more {{attention is paid}} to non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> attentional processes in judging <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage. It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage, but they could not replace <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage. Chapter 4 examines <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> unpredictability on people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> spatial directions <b>of</b> movements on <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage; specifically, it discloses <b>the</b> underlying mechanism <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> time passage such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R

5|$|A {{survey of}} European {{countries}} reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), a <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners {{were not allowed}} to vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law applicable to the case.

If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> Critique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Power <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> Kant {{develops}} a rigorous formulation <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments,</b> {{in which he}} makes a sharp distinction between <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste and <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreeable (both <b>of</b> which are, I claim, types <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments)</b> if only to dismiss <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreeable as worthy objects of study. Kant is primarily concerned with <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste, <b>the</b> main example <b>of</b> which is judging something to be beautiful (whether it be {{a work of art}} or a natural object). He asserts that such judgments are subjective, universal, necessary, disinterested, and do not presuppose a purpose. <b>The</b> other type <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgment</b> are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreeable, “which are <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> expressed by saying simply that one likes something or finds it pleasing. ” These are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> what, in Kant’s words, please “the senses in sensation” as opposed to pleasing ourcognition in reflection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this article, we model <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> {{foreign policy}} attitudes on both vote choice and {{casualty}} tolerance, using survey data {{collected during the}} 2004 election.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{apparent}} contradiction between Kant’s account and solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mathematical antinomies <b>of</b> pure speculative reason in <b>the</b> Critique <b>of</b> Pure Reason {{and in the}} Prolegomena. In the fi rst Critique, Kant claims that the theses are affi rmative <b>judgments,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form ‘A is B’, and the antitheses are infi nite <b>judgments,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form ‘A is non-B’. The theses and the antitheses are contradictorily opposed (i. e., the one true and the other false) and their proofs are valid only if a certain condition takes places, that is, if the world has a determinate magnitude. Otherwise, both are false and their proofs are wrong. Given transcendental realism, this condition takes place and the mathematical antinomies arise. Given transcendental idealism, this condition does not take place, the theses and the antitheses are false, and the mathematical antinomies disappear. At a fi rst glance, according to the Prolegomena the theses are affi rmative judgments and the antitheses are not infi nite judgments, but negative <b>judgments,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form ‘A is not B’.
