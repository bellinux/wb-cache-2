This kind of pocket cavities, due to the high Reynolds number and the specific shapes, are hardly investigated in previous researches. The heat transfer distribution and fluid flow over the pocket cavity have significant effects on the incoming flow of the OGV in the downstream distribution. In the present work, the specified triangular pocket cavities are built in a high aspect ratio channel and heat transfer and fluid flow over the pocket surface are investigated experimentally and numerically. These pocket cavities are built with different radii to find out optimized heat transfer distributions and flow patterns. Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT) is employed to measure heat transfer over the pocket surfaces at Reynolds number ranging from 87, 600 to 219, 000.

In this study, the largest heat transfer regions over a pocket cavity are found to be at the downstream edge where strong flow impingement occurs.

40|$|The {{combination}} of roughness elements with an impingement cooling systems offers an attractive means of achieving high heat transfer. Considerable {{care must be}} taken to choose the shape, size and the position of the roughness elements to maximise heat transfer and minimise pressure loss. In the last decade, many studies have been investigated the effect of changes in many of the geometric features, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the effect of the inevitable fillet. Blades and vanes are normally manufactured by casting so the fillet radius is unavoidable. The present paper investigates the effect of roughness element <b>fillet</b> <b>radii</b> on heat transfer enhancement in an impingement cooling system. Three configurations with streamwise ribs were studied. The streamwise ribs are all trapezoidal in cross section. In the three configurations the <b>fillet</b> <b>radii</b> are (1) 0 mm (sharp-edged), (2) 3 mm, and (3) 5 mm. The extra heat transfer area of the sharp-edged, 3 mm fillet and the 5 mm fillet rib configurations are reported. Two-staggered arrays (a uniform and non-uniform hole diameter array) of impingement plates are used. The jets from odd numbered rows impinge between the ribs while the jets from even numbered rows impinge onto the ribs. Tests were conducted at three different mass flow rates for each configuration. The average and local jet Reynolds numbers varied between 21500 and 31500, and 17000 and 41000 respectively. The transient liquid crystal technique was used to produce detailed Nusselt number distributions and row resolved average Nusselt number levels. The heat transfer enhancement and pressure loss due to the streamwise ribs are also compared to the smooth surface impingement cooling channel.
