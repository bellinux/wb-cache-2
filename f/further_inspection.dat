5|$|In 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were {{discovered}} in rock formed from late Devonian river sediments on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages reported at 375 MYA, 379 MYA, and 383 MYA. At {{the time of the}} species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff. Upon <b>further</b> <b>inspection,</b> the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A <b>further</b> <b>inspection</b> by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

25|$|Defective T and B cells {{as well as}} {{markedly}} decreased IgG1 {{responses were}} observed in miR-155-deficient mice, IgG1 is reduced whereas {{the expression of the}} IgM immunoglobulin remains normal in these mice. The change in IgG1 levels maybe {{explained by the fact that}} it is a target for miR-155 in B cells, the protein-encoding mRNA for the transcriptional regulator Pu.1-protein, elevation of Pu.1 protein predisposes defective IgG1 production. In addition to Pu.1, there are nearly 60 other differentially elevated genes in miR-155 deficient B cells, <b>further</b> <b>inspection</b> revealed possible miR-155 target sites in the 3' UTR regions in these genes.|$|E

25|$|The carcass must {{be checked}} {{to see if}} the animal had any of a {{specific}} list of internal injuries that would have rendered the animal a treifah before the slaughter. These injuries were established by the Talmudic Rabbis as being likely to cause the animal to die within 12 months time. Today all mammals are inspected for lung adhesions and other disqualifying signs of the lungs and most kosher birds will have their intestines inspected for infections. <b>Further</b> <b>inspection</b> of {{other parts of the body}} may be performed depending on the stringency applied and also depending on if any signs of sickness were detected before slaughter or during the processing of the animal.|$|E

25|$|K 177: Hamilton, Victoria. Following {{withdrawal}} from service, this locomotive {{was sold to}} the Langhi Morgala Museum in Ararat and placed on display. It was subsequently acquired by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc. <b>Further</b> <b>inspection</b> revealed a number of parts beyond restoration, so a complex deal was worked out with other organisations over the late 1990s. The end result was that the frame of K 177 was placed at Hamilton, Victoria, along with its own coupled wheels, motion gear and smoke deflectors. K 159 donated the tender body, frame and bogies, and K 174 provided the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck. The engine is currently un-numbered, but during the transition process it was alternately known as the Hamilton Exchange Locomotive or K 193.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR {{conducts a}} {{complete}} technical inspection {{prior to the}} first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick safety inspection is also completed prior to each practice session after the first.

After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first car out also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for <b>further</b> <b>inspection</b> at the NASCAR Research and Development Center.
