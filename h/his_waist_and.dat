5|$|Hargitay {{made his}} first film {{appearance}} with Mansfield in a bit part in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. The couple became a popular publicity and performing team who toured widely in stage shows, where Mansfield's leopard-spot bikini became a topic of discussion and newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay tossed her around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield's male lead in her Italian ventures—The Loves of Hercules and L'Amore Primitivo, and a major supporting character in Promises! Promises!. On stage, he was the male lead in The Tropicana Holiday, The House of Love, French Dressing, and other nightclub acts.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Pundalik legend, {{two of which are}} attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form {{on the banks of the}} river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra. The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.|$|E

60|$|The Bu'ster {{accepted}} the challenge at once by throwing his arms round <b>his</b> father's <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> endeavouring to throw him. Gaff resisted, {{and the result}} was that, in ten minutes or so, they were comparatively warm, and capable of active exertion.|$|R
25|$|To {{help his}} brother, Egil shot birds and {{collected}} their feathers, of which Velent made {{a pair of}} wings. Velent tied a bladder filled with blood around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> flew away. Niðung commanded Egil to shoot his fleeing brother, who hit the bladder, deceiving Niðung, and so Velent got away.|$|E
25|$|His Roman-style robes {{resemble}} a toga. The full-length garment has a flat, squared collar and gathers at neckline and sleeves, Belted at waist, the toga is drawn up loosely between <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> book so that soft folds drape diagonally across body front. A length of fabric is pulled {{over his left}} shoulder and is tucked under his left arm between the book and his body.|$|E
25|$|The {{standing}} {{figure is}} in typical pilgrim or travelling priest garb: waraji, a grey robe, and light-coloured leggings and arm covers. In addition, {{he wears a}} gong around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> carries a shakujō (錫杖) pilgrim's staff. Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif. The character's aggressive pose—right arm removed from his robe, menacing facial expression—indicates that he is likely not a benign pilgrim.|$|E
25|$|Adad's {{weapons are}} a knife stored on <b>his</b> rear <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> a combat staff used to counter Moroboshi's Spacium Sword.

25|$|During his youth, Ze'evi went {{to school}} in Givat HaShlosha. One night he shaved his head, wrapped a towel round <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> entered the food hall.

The nickname is also attributed to a long Arab dress he wore during his underground days in Palmach. Ze'evi had five children, Palmach, Sayar, Masada, Tze'ela and Arava. Palmach is also a member of Moledet and competed with Binyamin Elon for the party's leadership.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, 1835, a mob {{of several}} {{thousand}} surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address {{a meeting of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist George Thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor Theodore Lyman persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone. The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around <b>his</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> pulled him through the streets towards Boston Common, calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and had Garrison arrested and rushed off to the Leverett Street Jail for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (vanam meaning forest and thillai trees - botanical name Exocoeria agallocha, {{a species of}} {{mangrove}} trees - which currently grows in the Pichavaram wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or 'rishis' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and mantras or magical words. Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of Bhikshatana, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as Mohini. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance {{and the beauty of}} The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (nāgas) by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around <b>His</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).|$|E
60|$|An awful silence {{followed}} {{the launching of}} that thunderbolt. Eugène stood with open mouth, staring now at Geneviève, now at his father.

60|$|The {{baritone}} had {{not seen}} her {{but he had been}} told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further.

From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs. Kearney.|$|R

500|$|As Marko matured, {{he became}} headstrong; Vukašin {{once said that}} he had no control over his son, who went {{wherever}} he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes, his black moustache {{was the size of a}} six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at <b>his</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> a spear was slung across his back. Marko's pernach weighed 66okas (...) and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.|$|E
60|$|Guy had {{hauled in}} the slack {{of one of}} the {{numerous}} ropes attached to the main-mast that were floating away to leeward, and was fastening the end of it round <b>his</b> <b>waist.</b> Bluenose <b>and</b> the missionary turned quickly on hearing the seaman's shout, but they were too late to prevent the bold youth from carrying out his design, even if they had wished to do so.|$|R
60|$|And so, satisfied, {{he turned}} round {{to look at}} the bronze Perseus which rose just above him. Benvenuto Cellini's dark hero looked female, with his plump hips <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>waist,</b> female <b>and</b> rather insignificant: graceful, and rather vulgar. The clownish Bandinellis were somehow more to the point.--Then all the {{statuary}} in the Loggia! But that is a mistake. It looks too much like the yard of a monumental mason.|$|R
50|$|Gilderoy is {{securely}} chained by <b>his</b> hands, <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> {{feet and}} {{after three days}} so attired in the Edinburgh Tollbooth he is hung from a thirty foot high gibbet in April 1658 having expressed no remorse.

500|$|In 2004, Louisiana, USA State Representative Derrick Shepherd {{proposed}} a bill (HB1626), {{also known as}} the Baggy Pants Bill to Louisiana House of Representatives. The bill proposed that [...] "it shall be unlawful for any person to appear in public wearing his pants below <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> thereby exposing his skin or intimate clothing" [...] and that violators would be subjected to three eight-hour days of community service and a fine of up to US$175. The measure died in the face of opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union. The bill was {{proposed a}}gain in 2008 and was rejected by a state Senate panel. In two Louisiana towns, Delcambre (a maximum penalty of US$615 fine or up to six months in prison) and Opelousas (a maximum penalty of US$500 fine or up to six months in prison), wearing low slung pants that reveal buttock cleavage or undergarments is considered a misdemeanor. Garments that reveal underpants were banned in four other Louisiana towns including Alexandria and Shreveport, where violators face fines of US$150 or 15 days in jail, as well as Hawkinsville, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Some of Stark's {{men were}} engaged in driving the {{livestock}} further up the coast. Others noticed that Diana was in trouble, and called for reinforcements. [...] General Putnam {{and as many as}} 1000 troops (including Joseph Warren) came up on the shore near Diana, a place at the mouth of Chelsea Creek, in the modern Chelsea neighborhood by the McArdle bridge to East Boston. [...] Putnam waded out into the harbor up to <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> offered quarter to the sailors of Diana if they would surrender, but its cannon continued to fire, and attempts to tow her into deeper water continued. [...] Colonial forces continued firing on the ship, supported by two field pieces positioned on the shore. [...] Britannia and field pieces the British had landed on Noddle's Island also joined the cannonade. [...] At about 10 pm, the British rowers were forced to abandon the rescue of Diana due to the heavy fire. Diana drifted and ran aground again on the Mystic River side of the Chelsea coast, tipping onto one side. Lieutenant Graves abandoned Diana and transferred his men to Britannia, which was successfully towed to deeper water.|$|E
500|$|Hiram B. Shaw {{had just}} {{returned}} to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted {{the captain of the}} schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, [...] "They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore." [...] The captain tied a rope around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a life preserver to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the flotation device out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. [...] After receiving a cup of hot coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital.|$|E

500|$|At 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese {{launched}} an {{attack from the}} north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west. For the next 80 minutes, 900–1,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves. They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment {{to deal with them}} the Japanese attack stalled. Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns. A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack. [...] At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} show Obrenović {{standing before}} the Serb leaders and clan elders at Takovo and inciting them to revolt. According to legend, he appeared before the crowd and proclaimed: [...] "Here I am, and here you are. War to the Turks!". Obrenović is depicted standing atop a large stone, wearing a turban and a red, Oriental-style costume covered in golden embroidery, surrounded by a semi-circle of followers. A sword hangs from <b>his</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> two pistols protrude from his belt. His right arm points up at the sky, with the thumb, middle and index finger extended. With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag is a variant of that used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which ruled Montenegro {{at the time of}} the uprising, and is reminiscent of the Christian flag flown at the Battle of Kosovo, which according to popular belief, marked the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. It is unclear if the man wishes to take the flag away from Obrenović or help bear it. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.|$|E
2500|$|... {{literally}} means [...] "the three ranks", {{even though}} it actually comprises four ranks. The discrepancy arose because the yokozuna was traditionally regarded as an ōzeki with a special license to wear a particular rope around <b>his</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> perform a distinctive ring entry ceremony. In modern use san'yaku has a somewhat flexible definition. This is largely because the top two ranks of yokozuna and ōzeki have distinctive differences from the lower two ranks and from each other. [...] Therefore, a reference to san'yaku can sometimes mean only the bottom three ranks, or in other cases only sekiwake and komusubi.|$|E

His {{physical}} charm was lost, and a sort of disgust of <b>his</b> supple <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> rounded limbs came upon her, and disgust at herself for that one moment of yielding weakness; and also the keen fear of having been unjust, of having given him a claim which she was repudiating, troubled her.|$|R
