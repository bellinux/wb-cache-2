5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for Me. He was {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> a dark comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film {{was released in}} 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E

500|$|Existence {{resists the}} {{indifference}} {{of life and}} death, it lives beyond mechanical [...] "life," [...] it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> {{the very thought of}} this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought.

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{stated that}} he wanted an [...] "epic" [...] quality to the Christmas special.

[...] Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen {{at the onset of the}} episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was promoted like a movie. A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS.|$|E
