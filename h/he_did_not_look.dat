5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, {{but they did not}} pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like a military man, they felt he had the quality {{they were looking for}} in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
500|$|In The Railway Series children's {{books by}} the Rev. W. Awdry, the {{character}} Gordon the Big Engine is {{loosely based on}} an A1. According to the Rev. Awdry, in , Gordon was a [...] "hush-hush" [...] experimental prototype for Gresley's Pacific locomotives for the GNR (the so-called A0). Built in 1922, he was sold to the Fat Controller in 1923, once testing was complete. Following problems with the conjugated valve gear, Gordon was substantially rebuilt in 1939 on a two-cylinder chassis designed by the Fat Controller (which explains why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> exactly like an A1 in the books).|$|E

500|$|During his {{struggling}} phase, Vikram dubbed {{for other}} heroes in films including voices for Prabhu Deva in Kaadhalan, Ajith Kumar in Amaravathi and Abbas in Kandukondain Kandukondain respectively. Vikram has mentioned that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> down on dubbing {{and saw it}} as a [...] "dignity of labour". During the period he also attended dancing classes every day, and tried acting out different scenes, different characters with his small group of friends. He began to turn down chances to play supporting roles in films and was intent on making a breakthrough as a lead actor and notably turned down the role of Swarnamalya's fiancée in Mani Ratnam's Alaipayuthey. Vikram also rejected approaches from television serial producers, citing that working in television would reduce his chances of becoming a mainstream actor. He also refused opportunities to take part in film events as a backing dancer, with actor Sriman revealing that Vikram was [...] "one amongst not many" [...] who was not interested in travelling to Canada to participate in such shows.|$|E
500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York. [...] "My fiancee, Beth Windsor, had {{literally}} just worked into being bicoastal," [...] he said. [...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

And as in [...] and The Shiranui Sea (1975), <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> on the victims as objects of pity or agents of protest, but endeavored to understand their world, finding in their struggle to maintain their {{close relationship with the}} sea and their traditional ways of living, much of which had been upset by environmental pollution, [...] "the original figure of humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{was one of}} the few cricketers of {{his time}} whose Christian name was used more {{frequently}} than his initials. Standing only 5'6½" [...] tall, he put on copious weight near the end of his career, when his naturally corpulent build was dramatically accentuated. It is unfortunate, therefore, that most photographs of him were taken so late in his cricketing life. A man of droopy aspect, bushed eyes, some classically Victorian facial hair and a belt nearer his breast than his substantial waist, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> the part of the era's finest medium-pacer, but there were few who questioned his credentials.|$|E
2500|$|With Shemp gone, Healy {{and the two}} {{remaining}} stooges (Moe and Larry) needed a replacement, so Moe suggested his younger brother Jerry Howard. Healy reportedly {{took one look at}} Jerry, who had long chestnut red locks and a handlebar mustache, and remarked that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like he was funny. Jerry left the room and returned a few moments later with his head shaved (though his mustache remained for a time), and then quipped [...] "Boy, do I look girly." [...] Healy heard [...] "Curly", and the name stuck. (There are varying accounts as to how the Curly character actually came about.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Organized labor found J. J. McNamara an {{attractive}} figure to rally behind. By outward appearances, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{like a man}} who would dynamite his enemies. He was 34 years old, handsome, had an athletic build, always well-dressed and well-spoken. He had earned a law degree at night while working for the Iron Workers’ Union. J. J. McNamara assured Gompers that {{he had nothing to do}} with the Times bombing. Gompers believed him completely, and threw all his influence behind the McNamaras. With Gompers' endorsement, the entire US labor movement supported the McNamaras, with parades, mass rallies, publicity campaigns, and donations to the McNamaras' defense fund.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was sent}} {{off for the}} first time, however, in an Arsenal shirt on 26 February during a 1–1 road draw with Southampton, {{following}} a lunge at left-back Graeme Le Saux, for which Wenger was seen yelling an obscenity at van Persie from the sidelines. He then later lambasted his charge in the press. [...] "I do not support van Persie today, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> out of control at half-time. When the referee has sent off a home player, he is under pressure, so, if any player had to behave, it was him."

2500|$|In the afternoon, {{questioning}} {{turned to}} Reavis' {{discovery of the}} baptismal and burial records in San Bernardino. [...] The subject then turned to Alfred Sherwood's 1887 affidavit regarding Sophia's noble birth. [...] During this line of questioning an apparent contradiction appeared where Reavis had known of Miguel Noe and others with knowledge of Sophia's early life as early as 1885 yet <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{for any of these}} people till 1892. [...] On the morning of June 13, Reavis was forced to admit he had doubted some of the documents in his 1883 filing were genuine, but he had still filed them on advice of counsel while believing his wife was the true heir. [...] At the same time he admitted that he had at that time not told his lawyers of his marriage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{end of the}} war did {{not meet}} with a {{universal}} welcome in Rome. When the Senate decided upon a peace treaty with Carthage, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, a former consul, said <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> upon the termination of the war as a blessing to Rome, since he feared that the Roman people would now sink back again into its former slumbers, from which it had been roused by the presence of Hannibal. Others, most notably Cato the Elder, feared that if Carthage was not completely destroyed it would soon regain its power and pose new threats to Rome; he pressed for harsher peace conditions. Even after the peace, Cato insisted on the destruction of Carthage, ending all his speeches with [...] "Carthage must be destroyed", even if they {{had nothing to do with}} Carthage.|$|E
2500|$|During the First Test of {{the tour}} at Madras, Border scored 106 and the match ended in a {{historic}} tie, only the second such result in history. The other two Tests were drawn, and Border finished the tour with 245 runs at 81.66. The 1986–87 Australian season brought another Ashes series, and another series loss. After England won the First Test, consecutive centuries by Border at Perth and Adelaide enabled Australia to secure consecutive draws. However, Australia were defeated by an innings in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne and the team had won only two of their last 22 Tests, and none of their last 14. Despite a consolation victory in the Fifth Test dead rubber, Wisden thought that Border, [...] "lacked spark {{and the ability to}} inspire a young team much in need of it. Hard task as he had, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> the man to lead the Test team from its troubled run." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1511, when rumours of the {{imminent}} death of Pope Julius II spread, Pompeo and Antonio Savelli spurred the Roman population to rebel against the Papal authority. Paolo Giovio {{points out that}} Pompeo was indignant because {{in the most recent}} Consistory for the creation of Cardinals, there was no Roman among the eight creations. [...] To the surprise of all, however, the barons of Rome were able to reach an agreement among themselves on 28 August 1511, and a truce was even arranged between the Orsini and the Colonna. [...] The nascent civil war was over. [...] When the Pope recovered, having been informed of the revolt by his niece, the Duchess of Urbino, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> with pleasure on Bishop Pompeo Colonna, and he was condemned. [...] He fled to his Abbey of Subiaco, while several of his fellow conspirators fled to France. [...] He was offered a pardon by Julius II, but he refused it, since the pardon did not include reinstatement as Bishop of Rieti. [...] Pompeo was so angry that he even threatened to join the French, who had seized Bologna earlier in the year, but his uncle Prospero firmly dissuaded him from such wild designs.|$|E
