5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape has been {{discovered}} to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{occurred}} near Nagoya, and {{was felt}} throughout the country, but {{was the strongest}} in central Japan. The cities of Gifu and Ogaki experienced heavy damage, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> fire, but Osaka and Nagoya were also significantly affected. The earthquake was strong in Tokyo, lasting for many minutes, and knocked items off shelves and stopped clocks.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the Mojave Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found anywhere else in the world. The existence of these species is <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
5|$|Bedell {{decided not}} to seek reelection in 1986 after {{contracting}} Lyme Disease from a tick bite. Since then, he has founded a center for alternative medicine and is a noted advocate of health freedom. <b>Due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> his friendship with Tom Harkin, he remains an important political figure in Iowa, with politicians such as Howard Dean meeting him in their trips to the state. Also, the Elinor Bedell State Park was established in 1998 on land donated by Berkley and Elinor Bedell. The park is named after the Congressman's wife.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Country Grammar {{became the}} ninth hip hop album to be {{certified}} Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 10 million copies in the US. Its commercial success secured Nelly's status {{as one of the}} most successful hip hop acts of the 2000s decade. On Billboard decade-end chart, Nelly ranked as the third most successful act of the 2000s decade, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the success of Country Grammar and his follow-up album Nellyville (2002).|$|E
5000|$|Her {{extended}} genealogy displays {{an extreme}} case of pedigree collapse; {{in the five}} preceding generations, the 62 possible positions for her ancestors are filled by only 30 individuals, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> multiple half-sibling marriages. (By comparison, Charles II of Spain, an extreme case of European royal pedigree collapse, has 32 individuals in those positions, in his case <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> multiple uncle-niece marriages.) ...|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to this emerging threat, Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E
5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the fact that the script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The LS 460 and LS 460 L {{arrived at}} dealerships in Japan, the U.S., and Europe in late 2006, and the vehicle reached Australia, East Asia, and the Middle East in 2007. The U.S. base {{prices for the}} 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L were US$61,000 and US$71,000, respectively. In 2006 and 2007, the average price paid for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans {{exceeded}} US$80,000, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> added options packages, placing the Lexus LS in the same average price range as its long-wheelbase Audi, BMW, and Jaguar rivals for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The genus {{once served}} as a {{wastebasket}} taxon for many agaric mushrooms with a white spore print, gills attached to the stem, and an annulus. <b>Due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> differing interpretations on {{the limits of the}} genus, over 270 species and varieties have been placed in Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species belong to Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names belong to species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Bruxner's {{parliamentary}} {{career was}} {{to be on the}} opposition benches, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the disintegration of the larger opposition party, the UAP, after the 1943 Federal election. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who continued as Opposition Leader. Mair resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, to be replaced by former Assembly Speaker Reginald Weaver. At the 1944 election, Bruxner's stable leadership ensured that the Country Party retained all ten of its seats in the Legislative Assembly. Bruxner retained his seat with 67.73%.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathon {{is remembered}} as an [...] "iconic" [...] character, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the impact his {{homosexual}} status {{had on the}} viewing public. He and boyfriend Jamie's kiss was the first same-sex kiss on prime time New Zealand television and was even edited <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the controversy at the time. His 2011 return was well received upon airing though his bisexual reclassification was criticized by fans.|$|R
5|$|As {{both sides}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the NBA {{canceled}} the preseason and all games through December. On November 14, the players dissolved the union, allowing them to file antitrust lawsuits against the league. On November 26, both sides reached a tentative agreement to end the lockout. The new CBA calls for a revenue split of 49-to-51.2% and a flexible salary cap structure with harsher luxury tax. After the tentative deal was reached, owners allowed players to have voluntary workouts at team sites starting December 1. After the deal was ratified on December 8, training camps, trades and free agency began the next day. During the lockout, some players signed contracts to play in other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, with most of them having the option to return upon the lockout's conclusion. The lockout also affected the economy <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.|$|E
5|$|From {{its heyday}} of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E
5|$|He was unfortunate {{again on}} 22 April 1943 when, {{in command of}} Camilla on an RAAF {{contract}} involving the transport of military personnel to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, {{and was forced to}} attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. <b>Due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch spent about 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer. A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances no Court of Inquiry be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.|$|E

5|$|In August 2006, several tribes {{located in}} Ramadi {{and led by}} Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha began to form what would {{eventually}} become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The Anbar Awakening helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, {{as well as other}} cities such as Hīt, Haditha, and Rutbah. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural entry points for foreign fighters to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al-Karmah.|$|E
5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole. There are generally more females than males in each single year of age, except for the youngest ages (0–18) and late-30s and late-50s. Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century. There is a large group of children under the age of five which reflecting high numbers of births in recent years. Births are up 20% since 2001, increasing from 14,427 to 17,423 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, <b>due</b> <b>largely</b> <b>to</b> the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
