5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, {{the issue}} before us <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> a State can execute the innocent. It is, as the Court notes, whether a fairly convicted and {{therefore}} legally guilty person is constitutionally entitled {{to yet another}} judicial proceeding in which to adjudicate his guilt anew, 10 years after conviction, notwithstanding his failure to demonstrate that constitutional error infected his trial.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, the issue <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> John {{tried to kill}} Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered {{to prove that the}} officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
500|$|We {{are also}} of opinion {{that as the}} right of the {{plaintiff}} to sue was given by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. The question <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. The point is that the plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E

500|$|One way to {{interpret}} the clause is by the intentionalist view. As stated by University of North Carolina School of Law professor Michael J. Gerhardt, this is the position that [...] "the critical inquiry <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> {{the letter of the}} law has been broken (it has) but rather whether the problem that the clause exists to preclude—conflicts of interest in nominating a member of Congress who has been able to vote himself or herself a raise—has been avoided".

According to conservative constitutional law attorney Bruce Fein, [...] "The so-called fix fits the purpose of the clause like a glove." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{in which she}} was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Sotomayor argued that the {{exclusion}} of Ayala's counsel from the Batson hearings [...] "substantially influenced the outcome" [...] of the case and that [...] "grave doubt exists as to whether [...] was harmless". She critiqued Justice Alito's methodological approach, arguing that [...] "he proper inquiry <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> the trial court’s determination can be sustained, but whether it may have been different had counsel been present". Considering the evidence presented in this case, Justice Sotomayor concluded that there [...] "is neither a factual nor a legal basis for the Court’s confidence" [...] that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges was race neutral. She argued that in light of [...] "the strength of Ayala’s prima facie case", the Court should have upheld the Ninth Circuit's ruling.|$|E

Drake then ends up on a balcony singing in front of the Toronto skyline. Both are shown in scenes contemplating intermixed with Songz joining Drake on the balcony. Subsequently scenes are shown of Drake and Songz riding through Toronto nightlife, along with the contemplative scenes, such as a young boy playing basketball in which Songz has an illusion that it is him, and little girl blowing a dandelion. The video ends with the skyline and a quote stating, [...] "Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not.

500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining question <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E
500|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation {{seeks to}} {{decouple}} animal rights from animal liberation. For Cochrane, of central importance {{is the question}} of sentience, understood as [...] "the capacity for phenomenal consciousness". No position is taken on precisely how many animals are sentient, but, Cochrane argues, it is clear that at least some nonhuman animals are. Sentience alone does not afford moral status, but sentience implies the capacity for well-being; sentient beings have lives that can go better or worse for them. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that personhood is required for moral value, but Cochrane observes that there may be nonhuman animals who could be considered persons. In any case, it is argued that there are good reasons not to agree with Kant, and Cochrane concludes that {{there is no reason to}} limit the possession of moral status to humans. What needs to be considered <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> anything is owed to animals, but what is owed to them. Following a paper on animal rights by political philosopher Joel Feinberg, Cochrane suggests that animals possess rights on account of their interests. Cochrane then deals with four possible objections. Interest rights are defended against the claim that moral agency is a prerequisite of rights-possession, against the demand that rights be derived from social relations, against the suggestion, from R. G. Frey, that animals do not possess interests, and against the idea that inanimate entities and plants may possess interests.|$|E
2500|$|Sammon {{wrote that}} Scott {{thought it would}} be more provocative to imply that Deckard was a replicant. This ties back into the theme of [...] "what is it to be human?"

[...] And where those actions are [...] "justified by the individual's conscience, this gives his heroes uncommon strength and courage to endure the pressures, abuses, and injustices of others." [...] His films have thereby continually given us the [...] "quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Untener also {{organized}} {{a series of}} preaching seminars for priests. [...] At the 1993 National Conference of Bishops, Untener reportedly interrupted the proceedings by commenting on how many people felt bored during Mass. [...] Untener told a reporter, [...] "They {{were talking about the}} niceties of phrases - debating whether `prince' or `ruler' was a better word to use in the lectionary..." [...] Untener stood up and shouted, [...] "The biggest problem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> we use `prince' or `ruler.' The biggest problem is the Mass is boring for most people." [...] Untener encouraged priests to stick to one point in their homilies and to keep their talks at seven minutes or less.|$|E
2500|$|After {{dealing with}} another issue Donovan raised, that the {{regulation}} was {{not entitled to}} deference because it pre-empted state laws, by saying two issues had been confused and thus that question was moot, Scalia said [...] "he question before us <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> it represents the best interpretation of the statute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. The answer is obviously yes." [...] Legal dictionaries of the late 19th century, {{as well as the}} Court's own jurisprudence of that era, did not define interest so narrowly, and indeed such flat fees were often intended to evade state anti-usury laws, as state courts of that era had ruled. Finally, he rejected an argument that penalties were inherently separate from interest by suggesting the petitioner had misread the case they were relying on and citing what he considered more appropriate. The section of the National Banking Act at issue, he noted, did not distinguish between interest and penalties.|$|E
