40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{in-house}} R&D and innovation management practices on innovation success in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). While {{there is little doubt}} about the significance of technology competence for generating successful innovations, inhouse R&D activities may be a particular challenge for SMEs due to high risk exposure, high fixed costs, <b>high</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>investment</b> and severe financial constraints. SMEs may thus opt for refraining from R&D and relying more on innovation management tools in order to achieve innovation success. We analyse whether such a strategy can pay off. Based on data from the German CIS we find that R&D activities are a main driver for innovation success if combined with external R&D, using external innovation sources or by entering into cooperation agreements. SMEs without in-house R&D can yield a similar innovation success if they effectively apply human resource management tools or team work to facilitate innovation processes.

40|$|A {{rapidly growing}} mutual fund {{category}} is Fund of Funds (FOFs), which invest in other mutual funds instead of individual securities. This study reports on FOFs’ characteristics and performance relative to traditional equity {{mutual funds and}} finds that FOFs compare favourably. In particular, FOFs with identified managers outperform their unidentified counterparts, and FOFs that invest in-family outperform both traditional equity funds and those FOFs investing out-of-family. Finally, replicating FOFs’ holdings can be prohibitively expensive since they commonly hold funds with <b>high</b> <b>minimum</b> initial <b>investments,</b> closed funds and/or funds that are restricted to a particular investor type...|$|R
50|$|It {{is useful}} for {{research}} because it makes differences {{between male and female}} heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence. However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas {{women are more likely to}} imagine themselves as passive participants. Women’s fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment, whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail. One explanation of this difference comes from the evolutionary perspective. Women have a <b>higher</b> <b>minimum</b> parental <b>investment</b> then males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring’s chance of survival.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, the {{regulatory}} regime {{will take a}} two tier approach, making a distinction between funds which are offered generally {{to members of the}} public (which will require a high degree of regulation {{because of the nature of}} potential investors), and non-public funds. [...] Non-public funds are usually either categorised as private funds or professional funds or some equivalent label. Typically, investors in non-public funds can be assumed to be sophisticated because of the nature of the offering - there may, for example, be a <b>high</b> <b>minimum</b> initial <b>investment,</b> say US$100,000, and/or a requirement that investors establish that they are [...] "professional investors" [...] (although some offshore jurisdictions allow investors to self-certify this). Alternatively the fund may be designed for a small and select group of investors and the constitutional documents will limit the number of investors, say to no more than 50. Although most offshore jurisdictions permit funds to obtain licences to operate as public funds, the onerous regulatory requirements associated with such licences usually means that only a small minority of offshore funds are available for subscription by the general public.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{municipal}} bonds {{have been one}} of the least liquid assets on the market.
