5|$|Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have {{suggested}} that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon,</b> where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process.

5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that he thought of King Kong after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant gorilla fight a <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon</b> or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} had {{infectious}} saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon</b> was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E

5|$|Evidence that Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} social groups {{comes from a}} bonebed found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The bonebed {{includes}} the remains of three Daspletosaurus, including a large adult, a small juvenile, and another individual of intermediate size. At least five hadrosaurs are preserved at the same location. Geologic evidence indicates that the remains were not brought together by river currents but {{that all of the}} animals were buried simultaneously at the same location. The hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear many marks from tyrannosaur teeth, indicating that the Daspletosaurus were feeding on the hadrosaurs at the time of death. The cause of death is unknown. Currie speculates that the daspletosaurs formed a pack, although this cannot be stated with certainty. Other scientists are skeptical of the evidence for social groups in Daspletosaurus and other large theropods; Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have suggested that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon,</b> where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in the process.|$|E

5|$|Varanus salvadorii is {{a species}} of monitor lizard, which is endemic to New Guinea. It is also known by the common names {{crocodile}} monitor, Papua(n) monitor, Salvadori's monitor and artellia. The largest monitor lizard in New Guinea, it {{is believed to be}} one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to , and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world's largest lizard, the <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon.</b> It is the sole member of the subgenus Papusaurus. V.salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body and yellowish bands, a blunt snout and a very long tail. It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island, where it feeds on birds, small mammals, eggs, and carrion in the wild, using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey. Like all monitors, it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can, and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors. Little is known of its reproduction and development, as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity.|$|E

The <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon,</b> which normally reproduces sexually, has also been found able to reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis. A case has been documented of a <b>Komodo</b> <b>dragon</b> reproducing via sexual reproduction after a known parthenogenetic event, highlighting that these cases of parthenogenesis are reproductive accidents, rather than adaptive, facultative parthenogenesis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Komodo</b> <b>dragons</b> {{have long}} been great zoo attractions, where their size and {{reputation}} make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce.

A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper.
