As they try {{to decide how to}} deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.|$|E

In November 1792, its investors met at the Pennsylvania State House (today Independence Hall) to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> their fund. On November 12, they adopted a proposal to form a general insurance company, {{to be called the}} Insurance Company of North America. On November 19, the investors adopted articles of association, giving the company the ability to write fire, life, or marine insurance, though initially the investors would focus solely on marine.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February, Drake {{called for}} a council of war to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the city.

However they all agreed that the English crown would not tolerate the huge finance that would be involved. It was agreed that with a fever spreading rapidly and the ransom now completed it was decided to abandon the city as soon as the ransom was collected.|$|E
25|$|In Vienna, Lueger has {{a square}} named after him, {{at least two}} statues were erected in his honour and until April 2012 {{a section of the}} Ringstraße bore his name. It has been very {{difficult}} to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> monuments honoring historical figures whose reputation has been widely called into question as Europeans (and others) reflect on the historical background to the holocaust. With the Anschluss of Austria in 1938 street names carrying Jewish names or the names of pacifists were changed. After World War II, Austria started a full-scale program of de-Nazification on both cultural and topographical levels. Nazified street signs were torn down and their names changed back from Nazi to Habsburg heroes.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port where he might find a return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was nowhere in sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E
25|$|As World War II ended, the United States had to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> {{regard to}} its Intelligence structure. Not wanting to relive another Pearl Harbor, {{and with the}} growing threat of the Cold War, the United States decided to {{establish}} an Intelligence agency that operated continually rather than only during times of war and conflict. The National Security Act of 1947 (signed by President Harry S. Truman on July 26, 1947) implemented a permanent, non-military, Intelligence agency called the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency that evolved out of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The CIA {{was not to be}} part of the military command structure, nor was it to have a domestic role or police power and was to be under the control of the newly established position of Director of Central Intelligence. In addition to creating the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Act of 1947 established the United States National Security Council (NSC). The National Security Council was composed of the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (now titled, Director of Central Intelligence), and other key members to advise the President on national security and foreign policy matters.|$|E
25|$|Some {{money went}} to Vysotsky, {{the rest was}} {{distributed}} amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable return on their efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated {{at the time of}} the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally the doctors had to account for every ampule, thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). In the last few days Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP's. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he may die, his associates gathered to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.|$|E

She was {{not expected to be}} completed until 1945, and the sinking of the British capital ships [...] and [...] by IJN bombers had called into question the viability of battleships in the war. The navy also wanted to make the large drydock in which the ship was being built available, which required either scrapping the portion already completed or finishing it enough to launch it and clear the drydock. The IJN decided on the latter, albeit with a reduced work force which was expected to be able to launch the ship in one year.|$|E

2500|$|Better Place {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about [...] million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Fewer than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars had been deployed in Israel and only around 400 units in Denmark. Under Better Place's business model, the company owned the batteries, so the court liquidator had to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> customers {{who did not have}} ownership of the battery and risked being left with a useless car.|$|E

2500|$|In 1859, Sarah {{learned that}} her father had died overseas. Her mother summoned a family council, {{including}} Morny, to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> her. Morny proposed that Sarah should become an actress, an idea that horrified Sarah, as she had never been inside a theater. [...] Morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the Comedie Française in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend Alexandre Dumas, père. The play they attended was Brittanicus, by Jean Racine, followed by the classical tragedy Amphytrion by Plautus. Sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play, she began to sob loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience. Morny and others in their party were angry at her and left, but Dumas comforted her, and later told Morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her [...] "my little star".|$|E
2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. [...] As a result, the couple must <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo’s humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|E
2500|$|City {{officials}} {{approved the}} final master plan on November 20, 2006. [...] The project included 686 housing units (down from 772 in June 2006), [...] of retail space (up from [...] in June 2006), [...] {{of office space}} (up from [...] in June 2006), 1,700 underground parking spaces (down from 1,900 in June 2006), and [...] of land for a public library. Twenty percent of the condominiums would be priced for low-income people. The public park had not disappeared (as previously reported), but just [...] were set aside for what was now called [...] "Central Plaza". Tenth Street NW was reopened, a narrowed I Street NW was reopened between 9th and 10th Streets NW, and 30 percent of the retail space was set aside for non-chain stores. Two condominium buildings occupied the corner of 9th and H Streets NW, while two larger apartment buildings occupied the corner of 10th and H Streets NW. A north-south running open-air plaza occupied the space between them. Two office buildings occupied {{the south end of}} the block between 10th and 11th Streets NW, while an open-air public park with fountain was on the north end. A [...] wide, covered [...] "pedestrian street" [...] ran east-west between the buildings on both blocks. Foster and Partners oversaw the design of the development, while the local firm of Shalom Baranes Associates was the lead architect. The Washington Business Journal and Washington Times reported the project's total cost as $650 million, but the Washington Post pegged it at $630 million. City officials estimated that the development would create more than 7,500 temporary construction jobs and 5,200 permanent jobs, and bring in $30 million annually in income, sales, and property tax revenues. Construction was set to begin in late 2008 and conclude by mid-2011. The city had yet to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> its remaining [...] parcel, which occupied the west end of the triangular block bordering New York Avenue NW between 9th and 10th Streets NW, but city officials were still pushing for a public library on the spot.|$|E
