25|$|According to tradition, Father Neri {{arrived here}} from preaching at {{missions}} in Dolores Hidalgo. While resting under a mesquite tree where the sanctuary is now located, he dreamt of Jesus wearing {{a crown of}} thorns and carrying a cross. Jesus told Father Neri {{that it was his}} will that the area be converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for penance and prayer. A different version of this story states that Father Neri was here due to his ill health and was assisting at a small church called the Capilla de San Miguelito, which is still found {{on the banks of the}} Laja River. At that time, the native Guachichiles and Pames were not completely converted to Christianity and considered the thermal springs in the area sacred and medicinal. It was also supposedly a favored place for rites that included fornication. One reason to build the church was to counter this practice.|$|E
25|$|Saidpur {{village is}} {{supposedly}} named after Said Khan, {{the son of}} Sarang Khan. The 500-year-old village was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of Hindu worship by a Mughal commander, Raja Man Singh. He constructed {{a number of small}} ponds: Rama kunda, Sita kunda, Lakshaman kunda, and Hanuman kunda. The region is home to a small Hindu temple that is preserved, showing the presence of Hindu people in the region. The shrine of Sufi mystic Pir Meher Ali Shah is located at Golra Sharif, which has a rich cultural heritage of the pre-Islamic period. Archaeological remains of the Buddhist era can also still be found in the region. The shrine of Bari Imam was built by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

25|$|The 19th century Oxford Movement {{brought the}} High Church within the Church of England <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of {{confident}} {{leadership of the}} mainstream of the church. By {{the end of that}} century, many were struggling to find suitable forms of worship that were at once obedient to the letter of the Book of Common Prayer (if not its intention) and reflected the desire to a return to more Catholic forms of ritual and ceremonial. Some in the church took on board much of the ritual of the Tridentine Mass. Dearmer {{and other members of the}} Alcuin Club decried this wholesale adaptation of Italianate forms, and they campaigned for a revived English Catholicism that was rooted in pre-Reformation ritual, especially in the Sarum Use — something they termed the Anglican Use or English Use. The Parson's Handbook is Dearmer's brotherly advice to fellow churchmen about the correct way to conduct proper and fitting English worship. Dearmer's writing style is strong: he disparages customs he finds quaint or misguided, and makes good use of his subtle wit. Although Deamer's directions would have originally been considered High Church, the popularity of the Handbook has made them normative. This norm has been influential throughout those portions of the Anglican Communion that have been open to the development of a more Catholic ritual. Although the Handbook now appears somewhat dated, and many Anglican provinces have adopted more modern liturgies than the single BCP of Dearmer's age, his work remains surprisingly useful in the modern context.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} practitioner in {{the field}} of psychodrama is Carl Hollander. Hollander was the 37th director certified by Moreno in psychodrama. He is known primarily for his creation of the Hollander Psychodrama Curve, which may be utilized as a way to understand how a psychodrama session is structured. Hollander uses the image of a curve to explain the three parts of a psychodrama session: the warm-up, the activity, and the integration. [...] The warm-up exists to put patients <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of spontaneity and creativity in order to be open in the act of psychodrama. The [...] "activity" [...] is the actual enactment of the psychodrama process. Finally, the [...] "curve" [...] moves to integration. It serves as closure and discussion of the session, and considers how the session can be brought into real life – a sort of debriefing.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Preston R. Austin set out to build a new port on the western shore. [...] He established the town of Austwell in 1911, [...] and quickly began dredging in 1914 to build a channel. In the early stages of development, the channel filled with mud and was abandoned. Meanwhile, on the eastern shore, the city of Seadrift, which had been established following the American Civil War, began to develop <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of interest for fishing and shipping. The town, which was most likely named for floating debris swept ashore by the Guadalupe River, was incorporated in 1912, and by 1914 had a population of 1,250. The growth subsided in 1919, after a hurricane ravaged the area. In 1926, only 321 lived in the town. The population slowly recovered, and had surpassed its original peak in 1990, following a wave of Vietnamese refugees, who emigrated to the city after the Vietnam War. In 2000, the city had 1,352 residents.|$|E
500|$|In March 1996, Sega of Japan representatives, {{including}} CEO Hayao Nakayama, visited STI {{headquarters to}} evaluate the game's progress. They were unimpressed by the main game engine's performance on the Saturn, although Senn and Alon {{did not have an}} opportunity to demonstrate the PC version. Therefore, Nakayama requested the entire game be reworked around the boss engine. To achieve this in time for the strict December 1996 deadline, Coffin's team was moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of isolation from further company politics and worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day. [...] Then, in April, Bernie Stolar approached the STI team and inquired of Wallis what he could do to help the game meet its deadline.

[...] However, the engine's creator and lead programmer of the original Mega Drive Sonic games, Yuji Naka, reportedly threatened to leave the company if it was used. [...] STI lost two weeks of development time from the loss of the Nights engine. A playable demo of the game was displayed at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo.|$|E
