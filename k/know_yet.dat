500|$|On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a {{televised}} statement {{in which he}} said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. [...] "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," [...] he said. [...] "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." [...] He said he did not <b>know</b> <b>yet</b> when he would be returning to golf. He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.|$|E
500|$|What the Cabinet did not <b>know</b> <b>yet,</b> however, {{was that}} Indonesia had {{prepared}} {{an alternative to}} going over the edge. That same day, 10 September, Suwito asked for Britain to avoid a terrible 'misunderstanding,' and in a secret offer asked them to use the Lombok Strait instead. While further away from Jakarta, it was still claimed by Indonesia and might help the British attempt to save face while not stepping into a war they did not truly desire. With the Foreign Office's backing, Thorneycroft and Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home approved the compromise and notified Suwito that the ships would take the Lombok Strait instead. Suwito appeared, according to eyewitnesses, [...] "extremely relieved" [...] at having avoided full conflict. The Victorious, after rendezvousing with the destroyer HMS Hampshire along with the frigates HMS Dido and HMS Berwick, sailed safely through the Lombok Strait on 12 September.|$|E

500|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips {{about how to deal}} with Congress. [...] Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. [...] He did not <b>know</b> <b>yet</b> that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, [...] "These should also be 10 [...] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E

Later that month, Fortus discussed the band working on new material and {{taking a break from}} touring. A year later, Fortus discussed a potential 2016 tour and {{mentioned that}} the next album [...] "should be out" [...] by then. Reed responded by saying [...] "When will it come out?

2500|$|Critics of Peña Nieto's {{security}} strategy, however, {{say that}} he has offered [...] "little sense" [...] in exactly how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wonder whether Peña Nieto is holding back politically sensitive details in his security strategy or simply does not <b>know</b> <b>yet</b> how he will squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. Moreover, U.S. officials are worried that the return of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after ruling Mexico for 71 years [...] may mean returning to the old PRI tactics of [...] "corruption [...] backroom deals" [...] with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace. Peña Nieto denies that he will negotiate with the cartels.|$|E
2500|$|On September 30, 2016 the FDA {{issued a}} safety alert to {{consumers}} warning {{against the use}} of homeopathic teething gels and tablets following reports of adverse events after their use. The agency recommended that parents discard these products and [...] "seek advice from their health care professional for safe alternatives" [...] to homeopathy for teething. The pharmacy CVS announced, also on September 30, that it was voluntarily withdrawing the products from sale and on October 11 Hyland's (the manufacturer) announced that it was discontinuing their teething medicine in the United States though the products remain on sale in Canada. On October 12, Buzzfeed reported that the regulator had [...] "examined more than 400 reports of seizures, fever and vomiting, as well as 10 deaths" [...] over a six-year period. The investigation (including analyses of the products) is still ongoing and the FDA does not <b>know</b> <b>yet</b> if the deaths and illnesses were caused by the products. However a previous FDA investigation in 2010, following adverse effects reported then, found that these same products were improperly diluted and contained [...] "unsafe levels of belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade" [...] and that the reports of serious adverse events in children using this product were [...] "consistent with belladonna toxicity".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss the case. Sharpton began the {{interview}} by commending the [...] "blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community {{to stand up for}} this girl." [...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>yet</b> and I think that the proper {{thing to do is to}} support those that want justice." ...|$|E
