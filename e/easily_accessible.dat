Combination therapy of brachytherapy exclusively with chemotherapy is rare.|$|E
5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, <b>easily</b> <b>accessible,</b> and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E

5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation {{have criticized}} the Debian project for hosting the non-free {{repository}} and because the contrib and non-free areas are <b>easily</b> <b>accessible,</b> an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman.

5|$|The Visitor Center is {{near the}} monument's only entrance. Various {{displays}} and publications along with a short film about the geology of the area help to orient visitors. Ranger-led walks are available in summer and cover topics such as wildlife, flowers, plants, or geology. Self-guiding tours and displays are available year-round and are <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> from the Loop Drive.|$|E
5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes {{it one of the most}} interesting, rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} methods to render {{matrices}} {{into a more}} <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> form. They are generally referred to as matrix decomposition or matrix factorization techniques. The interest of all these techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question, such as determinant, rank or inverse, so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation, or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry out for some types of matrices.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> {{uncontaminated}} water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, {{based on}} the {{computer}} simulation results {{it has been shown}} that self-propelled Janus particles can be used for direct demonstration of the very interesting non-equilibrium phenomenon, ratchet effect. Ratcheting of Janus particles can be orders of magnitude stronger than for ordinary thermal potential ratchets and thus <b>easily</b> experimentally <b>accessible.</b> In particular, autonomous pumping of a large mixture of passive particles can be induced by just adding a small fraction of Janus particles.|$|R
5|$|Although {{myths and}} {{speculation}} about a Terra Australis ("Southern Land") {{date back to}} antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered and colonised by humans, unsighted until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf. The continent, however, remained largely neglected {{for the rest of}} the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.|$|E

5|$|Large {{areas of}} {{limestone}} on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for caving. Some of the caves {{have been known}} about since {{the establishment of the}} Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit {{the vast majority of the}} caves, but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are <b>easily</b> <b>accessible</b> to the public. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.|$|E
