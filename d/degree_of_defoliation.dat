40|$|Summary: To {{assess the}} effect of possum browse on plant growth, an index {{of the amount of}} foliage on about 50 trees of Fuchsia excorticata and the number of trees that died or were {{completely}} defoliated was measured at five sites in South Westland over 5 years.

The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> of fuchsia was significantly related to the density of possums at each site. Possums defoliate and kill fuchsia within two years once the catch-rate index of their density exceeds about 25 %.

It was presumed that low vigour of Japanese larch and Scots pine, probably indicated by small annual increment of the tree for a few years before an insect attack, favours this attack, and thus defoliation. This would mean that the method of calculating the loss of increment was incorrect. Further research was greatly needed. <p/...|$|E

Grass was the most heavily defoliated component of the vegetation, whereas Restionaceae and Cyperaceae were generally avoided. No grass species was consistently avoided by herbivores, and no species was consistently favoured. Instead selection among species varied with growth stage. The tall, coarse species were favoured on new burns when the vegetation was still short. The short species came into favour once the sward had grown taller. Defoliation was heaviest within the first year after burning and thereafter decreased substantially. The introduction of coarse grass grazers such as mountain zebra to the park might lead to greater use of the mature veld. Those grass species that underwent the heaviest defoliation on new burns (over 50 of leaves severed) showed three- to seven-fold increases in canopy spread cover over subsequent years.

40|$|Pests and {{pathogens}} attacking {{trees are}} common disturbances in European forests. Increasing {{the diversity of}} trees in forest stands may have an effect to counter this problem. Several researches showed reduced levels of herbivory in mixed tree stands, {{as well as an}} increased resistance to pest and diseases. In more diverse tree communities, individual tree species are less obvious to find by the herbivore (resource concentration hypothesis). More complex communities also provide more favourable conditions enhancing the control of natural enemies (shelter for birds, supplementary food for parasitoids). The objective of this research is to observe patterns of damage caused by pest and pathogen attacks in forest plots with increasing tree diversity in a recently established, large-scaled biodiversity experiment (FORBIO) in Belgium ([URL] The research was conducted by assessing selected trees for damage using a scoring system, and by assessing arthropod diversity with the vacuum sampling method. In total 2, 816 trees were assessed for three damage symptoms (defoliation, discoloration, and shoot damage) during early autumn 2012. While the arthropod samples were collected from a subset of 216 trees in spring 2012. From the total 2, 816 trees inspected, 75. 89 % suffered from defoliation, 52. 49 % suffered from discoloration, and 4. 13 % lost part of their shoots. Different tree species in different stand diversity showed different damage patterns. Betula pendula (birch) showed rather similar damage degrees caused by defoliation, discoloration, and shoot dieback in more or less diverse stands. While Fagus sylvatica (beech) showed reduced <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> and discoloration in more diverse stands. In case <b>of</b> <b>defoliation,</b> there were more birch trees (96. 07 % from 510 trees observed) showing damage symptoms than beech trees (89. 87 % from 523 trees observed). However, the mean damage was more severe in beech (67. 49 ± 29. 24 %) than in birch (9. 86 ± 4. 96 %). From the 216 trees sampled, 10, 087 individuals from 12 different orders were identified. Arthropod abundance in birch trees showed a similar trend in more or less diverse stand (107 - 123 arthropods per tree). Arthropod abundance in beech monoculture (42 arthropods per tree) was lower than in the most diverse stand (102 individual/trees). Shannon-Wienner diversity indices showed that arthropod found in birch monoculture stands (0. 31) were less diverse than in beech monoculture stands (1. 40). In more diverse stands, diversity indices of birch did not increase, but they did increase for beech. However, in the most diverse stands, diversity index was increased in birch (0. 82) and decreased in beech (0. 85). These preliminary results show that there are different pattern of pest and disease attack between species and in more or less diverse stands. An important result is that pest and pathogen attack was reduced in more diverse stands of beech. More of the results will be presented during the talk...|$|R

The clusters that display the lower <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> (groups 1 and 3) include the stands at higher elevations in the Alps (with P. abies) and Apennine (with F. sylvatica). These species grow in their optimal climatic conditions and form climax forests, often monospecific or with low diversity (Nocentini 2009; Caudullo and De Rigo, 2016). Picea abies and F. sylvatica are, for conifers and broadleaves respectively, the species with lowest crown defoliation (Table 1). By contrast, in group 2, the forests with high diversity and crown defoliation are located mainly on hills and in the sub-montane belt of both the Alps and the Apennines, where a mixing of mountain conifers at their lower limit and broadleaf species at their upper limit occur at an intermediate altitude occurs. In this area, trees {{may be subject to}} variable and non-optimal ecological conditions (Vacchiano et al. 2012). Moreover, the forest vegetation of the subalpine belt includes species severely damaged by pests and fungi, such as C. sativa (Battisti et al. 2014). The elevated levels of crown defoliation in group 4 may be associated with the hotter and drier Mediterranean climate. Elevated levels of crown defoliation were in fact found on the Mediterranean region (ICP Forests 2016).|$|E

However, as level <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> was strongly genetically correlated with subsequent growth rate, later estimates of heritabilities for growth would be inflated by defoliation effects...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} CO 2 emission, canopy characteristics and herbage accumulation in pastures of pensacola bahiagrass under frequencies <b>of</b> <b>defoliation.</b> The experiment was conducted at the Universidade Estadual Paulista "Julio de Mesquita Filho", Faculty of Agrarian Sciences and Veterinary of UNESP, Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brasil. The experimental period was from May 3 rd to July 26 th 2012. The experimental area comprised 28 m 2 of pensacola bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flügge), divided into 10 plots for allocation of treatment (frequencies <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> = 2 or 4 weeks). The following variables were studied: canopy height, light interception, leaf area index, herbage accumulation, tiller density, CO 2 emissions, soil temperature and moisture. The frequencies <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> in the months of May, June and July slightly affect pensacola bahiagrass characteristics. CO 2, soil temperature and moisture are more associated to environmental conditions (months of evaluation) than to the frequencies <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> imposed to the canopies...|$|R

40|$|En: IV International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural CropsThe {{experiment}} {{was performed on}} two-year-old loquat “Algerie” trees (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) grafted on Franco and Anger rootstocks, growing in a glasshouse under partially controlled conditions. Trees were submitted to five saline treatments for 5 months: 5 (control), 25, 35, 50 and 70 mM NaCl in nutrient solutions. At {{the end of the}} experiment, plant biomass, leaf Na and Cl concentrations, photosynthesis rate and various water relations parameters from both scion-rootstock combinations were measured and evaluated. The total dry weight of loquat plants on Anger rootstock was unaffected by salinity, whereas those grafted on Franco, a significant reduction in total dry weight was noted. Loquat trees grafted onto Franco treated with 50 mM and 70 mM NaCl caused a substantial <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> and foliar necrosis. Plants grafted onto Anger showed lower Na+ concentrations in leaves than those grafted onto Franco, demonstrating that it is an efficient Na+ excluder. Under low salinity levels the accumulation of Cl- in both rootstock-scion combinations was similar. Sodium had a more adverse effect than chloride on the dry weight. The reduction in photosynthesis level was more marked on plants grafted on Franco. Lower leaf water potential values were observed in plants grafted on Franco than those grafted on Anger at moderate salinity levels. Osmotic adjustment permitted the maintenance of leaf turgor in treated plants grafted on Anger, but did not prevent a decrease in leaf turgor in Franco. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Plants of Rumex obtusifolius L. {{were grown}} in Solardomes under ambient and {{elevated}} (+ 250 μmol mol− 1) mole fractions of CO 2 and {{were exposed to}} two levels of herbivory by Gastrophysa viridula Degeer larvae. The herbivory treatment lasted 1 month, thereafter half of the plants were harvested and over the following month {{during a period of}} regrowth physiological measurements were made on the remaining plants. At the termination of the herbivory treatment uninfested plants showed no damage, whereas the low and high herbivore treatments caused 20 – 40 % and 50 – 70 % loss of leaf area as a proportion of total leaf area, respectively. The CO 2 treatment did not affect the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation.</b> Total leaf area was not significantly affected by either CO 2 or herbivory. Uninfested plants grown in elevated concentrations of CO 2 showed increased growth, root-to-shoot ratios (RS), rates of photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance compared with uninfested plants grown in ambient CO 2. A/C 1 analysis revealed that plants grown in elevated CO 2 showed reductions in Vcmax. For plants grown in ambient CO 2 the high herbivory treatment led to increased rates of photosynthesis and decreased rates of dark respiration per unit leaf area, and caused increases in stomatal conductance and RS. For plants grown in elevated CO 2 the high herbivory treatment increased plant biomass and RS. The increases in RS in response to elevated CO 2 and herbivory appeared to be additive. Defoliation did not reduce the degree of photosynthetic down-regulation caused by growth in elevated concentrations of CO 2, but appeared to reduce the rate of ontogenic decline in photosynthesis in ambient CO 2...|$|E
40|$|Defoliation {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{of forest}} health and is associated with reduced productivity and tree mortality. Assessing the health of forests requires regular observations over large areas. Satellite remote sensing provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional ground-based assessment of forest health, but assessing defoliation can be difficult due to mixed pixels where vegetation cover is low or fragmented. In this study we apply a novel spectral unmixing technique, referred to as weighted Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (wMESMA), to Landsat 5 -TM and EO- 1 Hyperion data acquired over a Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) plantation in southern Australia. This technique combines an iterative mixture analysis cycle allowing endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis (MESMA) and a weighting algorithm that prioritizes wavebands based on their robustness against endmember variability. Spectral mixture analysis provides {{an estimate of the}} physically interpretable canopy cover, which is not necessarily correlated with defoliation in mixed-aged plantations due to natural variation in canopy cover as stands age. There is considerable variability in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> as well as in stand age among sites and in this study we found that results were significantly improved by the inclusion of an age correction algorithm for both the multi-spectral (R 2 no age correction = 0. 55 vs R 2 age correction = 0. 73 for Landsat) and hyperspectral (R 2 no age correction = 0. 12 vs R 2 age correction = 0. 50 for Hyperion) image data. The improved accuracy obtained from Landsat compared to the Hyperion data illustrates the potential of applying SMA techniques for analysis of multi-spectral datasets such as MODIS and SPOT-VEGETATION...|$|E

The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the introduction of the problematics of remote sensing using multispectral sensors and the basics of research into forest vegetation.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> {{intensity}} and season on Douglas-fir growth were studied in three replications in the Siuslaw National Forest during 1988 - 1990. Four intensities <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> were applied once in either spring or summer 1988. Stem diameter and canopy area were linearly {{inversely proportional to}} the level <b>of</b> <b>defoliation.</b> Defoliation intensity did not affect height growth (P> 0. 05). Greater losses in height occurred when seedlings were defoliated in spring than in summer. No differences in predawn and mid-day xylem water potential were observed between trees defoliated in summer or spring 1988. However, in 1989, 25 % defoliation reduced mid-day moisture stress whereas 50 and 75 % defoliation increased mid-day moisture stress (P 0. 5) of season or intensity on twig width were observed in 1990. Subdominant twigs were generally more sensitive to defoliation than dominant twigs. Greater losses (P < 0. 5) in area of subdominant twigs occurred when seedlings were defoliated in spring than in summer. Similar to area, length of twigs continued to respond to defoliation intensity in 1990. Length and width of dominant and subdominant twigs were smaller for spring compared to summer defoliated trees. Number of twigs were linearly inversely proportional to the level <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> intensity in 1989. Intensity did not affect number of twigs in 1990 except second whorls.

40|$|Rapid {{climate change}} in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic is causing {{vegetation}} change across large areas of tundra. Shrubs and trees are undergoing range expansions {{as part of an}} over-all trend of ‘greening’ of the tundra. This is of importance because northern peatlands contain around half of total soil carbon (C) and there is a potential for productive vegetation to interact with this C in a number of ways: (1) Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) in symbiosis with trees and shrubs could potentially stimulate decomposition through extracellular enzyme production whilst extracting nitrogen (N) for their hosts; (2) deep snow, trapped by tall vegetation insulates the soil, resulting in higher winter-time microbial activity and has potential to influence growing season microbial activity; (3) the biochemistry of litter and decomposition environment associated with more productive vegetation could result in accelerated mass loss of litter and stimulate decomposition of older soil C. This thesis investigates how productive sub-arctic plant species in Northern Sweden interact with soil C by using ‘space-for-time’ transitions from forests (Betula pubescens), through intermediate shrub vegetation (Betula, Salix), to tundra heath (Empetrum nigrum). This was to test how ECM fungi, winter snow accumulation, defoliation events and litter input influence C cycling. C stocks, respiration rates and ECM growth rates were measured across these ecotones. It was found that birch forests and shrub stands had significantly lower soil C storage and higher respiration rates than adjacent heaths. This is contrary to the predictions of earth system models. Higher ECM growth rates at plots with low C storage and high cycling rates implied that they had {{an important role in the}} stimulation of C decomposition. To test whether snow cover in forests over winter had an important effect on C cycling, soils were transplanted between forest and heath (different snow cover), and respiration rates were measured over summer. It was found that deep snow cover over winter increases microbial activity in summer due to a warmer, more stable winter environment; this is hypothesised to be due to the environmental selection of a more active assemblage of decomposing microbes. A <b>defoliation</b> event <b>of</b> part of the birch forest by caterpillars allowed for a natural ‘experiment’. Trees with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>defoliation</b> were compared in their influence over soil C cycling processes. Defoliated plots shifted to slower-cycling states through a shift in the ECM community. This further implied that ECM fungi have an important role to play in rapid cycling of C in forests. A decomposition experiment using the litter of significant plant species in forest, shrub and heath communities was carried out by transplanting them between these key environments. This work showed that rapid decomposition of litter in the forest is driven by an interaction between carbohydrate-rich litter input and an effective decomposer community. This work addresses the relationship between vegetation productivity and C storage in the soil. This theme runs through every experiment as they test specific interactions between different plant groups and the soil. The results from this thesis suggest that increasing productivity and shrub expansion in the Arctic will stimulate decomposition of soil C via a number of pathways. Plant-soil interactions are clearly of importance in determining the fate of C in ecosystems and will play a key part in the balance of C in the future...|$|R
