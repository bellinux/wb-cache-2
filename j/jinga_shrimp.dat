50|$|There {{are about}} fifteen species of prawn in the Kayal of which eleven are commercially {{important}}. Commercially important species include giant tiger prawn, Indian prawn, green tiger prawn, Metapenaeus dobsoni, speckled shrimp, <b>Jinga</b> <b>shrimp,</b> giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium idae, Macrobrachium Spence, Macrobrachium idella, Macrobrachium scabriculum {{and other species}} include Caridina nilotica, orange shrimp, Metapenaeus brevicornis and Macrobrachium equidens.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and <b>Jinga</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{sampling}} data – from November 2008 to January 2011 - {{were analyzed}} {{to determine the}} age {{and the growth of}} Metapenaeus affinis (<b>jinga</b> <b>shrimp).</b> The males presented 2 -year modes,  while  females  one more. The CL ∞  and  the  k  values were estimated to be 49, 75 mm and 0, 68 years- 1 for females and 35, 42 mm, 1, 33 years- 1, for males. The φ ’ value for the females was 2, 84, while for males 3, 22...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the dietary intake of {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by Kuwaiti population, concentrations of PAHs were determined in edible tissues of commercially important seafood (fish and shrimp) samples collected from fish markets in 2005. Naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthrene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were routinely detected in all samples analyzed. The concentrations of [PAHs ranged between 30 and 247 ng/g dry wt. with yellowfin seabream imported from Iran exhibiting the highest concentration followed by Nile tilapia imported from Egypt (218 ng/g dry wt.) and then by locally caught silver pomfret (142 ng/g dry wt.) and <b>Jinga</b> <b>shrimp</b> (139 ng/g dry wt.). The PAHs pattern was dominated {{by the presence of}} high molecular weight compounds with pyrene as the most prevalent compound (59. 1 % of the total). The mean exposure for the average adult Kuwaiti consumer to [PAHs and benzo(a) pyrene equivalents (BaPEs) was estimated to be 1. 3 >g/day and 0. 0013 >g/day, respectively. The concentration and composition of PAHs found in this study are similar to those reported for fish from the Arabian Gulf basin in other studies over the past two decades, suggesting that the sources of pollution might have remained relatively unchanged. Nevertheless, the levels of exposure to PAHs through seafood consumption in the Northern Arabian Gulf environment, particularly in Kuwait, do not represent a...|$|E
