50|$|In {{the field}} of {{automotive}} engineering, <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> describes {{a situation in which}} an automobile engine or other vehicle component moves into the space normally allocated for the feet of the front seat occupants. Automotive crash testing agencies such as Euro NCAP and IIHS consider levels of <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> when conducting assessments. Vehicles that display excessive deformation of the footwell are noted.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} Isuzu Rodeo and its twin, the Honda Passport received {{a rating of}} [...] "Poor" [...] in the IIHS frontal offset test conducted at 40 mph due to a poor safety cage and dummy movement, and excessive <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> that contributed to injuries to both legs.|$|E
5000|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{gave the}} Contour a [...] "Poor" [...] overall rating in the frontal impact crash. The head, neck, and chest were all well {{protected}} and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, excessive <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> contributed to high forces on both legs and a [...] "Marginal" [...] structural rating. The Contour received five stars {{for both the}} driver and passenger in the NHTSA test.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} was also mildly revised, though the basic dashboard architecture {{was the same}} as before. Safety specification was improved, with the car gaining a full-size driver airbag in place of the smaller 'euro-bag' fitted in the Mk I Mondeo. The Mk II gained a 'flagged' 3 star rating in EuroNCAP testing, which was average for rivals of its time (the same as the Vauxhall Vectra, better than the Citroën Xantia and Peugeot 406, and worse than the Nissan Primera). The cars structure suffering excessive <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> in the frontal impact and a disturbing B pillar displacement in the side test.|$|E
30|$|Despite a {{reduction}} in weight of 32 % in the front end, excellent crash behaviour was achieved. In several areas, the crash behaviour was actually improved {{in comparison to the}} reference structure. For example, the <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> measurement of 51  mm of the DLR concept is clearly an improvement over the 100  mm of the reference structure.|$|E
40|$|Injuries to {{the lower}} {{extremities}} {{are among the most}} serious, non life threatening injuries occuring nowadays. In order to investigate and predict the occurence of injuries, biofidelic research tools, like mathematical human body models are needed. The model of the lower extremity, presented here, includes active musculature, simulating bracing and fracture at certain injury thresholds found in literature. The model was validated with toe and heel impact tests on human specimens and volunteers and generally good agreement was found between experimental results and simulations. Using the model in a <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> simulation illustrates the prediction of fracture due to the contribution of active musculature in tibia loading...|$|E
40|$|Many {{accident}} {{studies have}} shown that lower leg injuries are common in frontal impact car accidents. Of these, injuries to the ankle are the most serious and the most likely to lead to long-term morbidity. Fourteen PMHS specimens were impacted using a new double-impact sled rig that loads the leg in a realistic, car-equivalent manner. The sled separately reproduces the vehicle deceleration and <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> typically seen in frontal impacts. The impacts were at a range of foot loading severities, with a constant-force knee restraint and Achilles tendon tension applied such as to reproduce the emergency braking forces found in simulator studies. Only one impact was applied to each specimen, which was then examined for injury by x-ray and necropsy. The injuries generated were considered to be representative of those seen in car accidents. Tests at each severity were then replicated with a THOR-Lx lower leg and an injury risk curve for the THOR-Lx is presented...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the ability of lower limb surrogates to predict injury due to floor impact in {{military}} vehicles during anti-vehicular (AV) landmine explosions. Most such surrogates have originally been constructed for use in automotive crash applications, where <b>footwell</b> <b>intrusion</b> is the main source of lower limb injury. Land mine explosions, however, create different loading conditions on the lower leg. Comparatively, the peak loads are higher but the durations are shorter and the loading occurs axially through the tibia, instead of the axial loading combined with foot rotation that is often observed in automotive applications. The specific aims of this study are 1) reproduction of the vehicle floor movement and tibia force during an anti-vehicular mine blast using a linear impactor; 2) determination of human response corridors as a result of such impact conditions; and 3) assessment of the existing mechanical surrogates 2 ̆ 7 ability to match these corridors. The vehicle floor movement and tibia force experienced by a Hybrid III dummy during an AV mine explosion test was reproduced using a linear impactor for three different conditions representing three different explosive masses. Next, the same impact conditions were applied on instrumented PMHS legs and the resulting tibia forces were measured as well as injuries in two legs impacted under the most severe condition noted. Human response corridors were developed based on normalized and averaged data. The existing human surrogates: Hybrid III with a ankle/toe assembly and the THOR lower leg were assessed on their ability to match these corridors. The THOR lower leg was found to be a closer match to these corridors, especially under less severe conditions, while under higher conditions a compliant element which can handle higher forces is necessary. Using the ankle/toe complex, ankle forces were found to be the largest forces in the leg under axial impact. The boot was found to have a smaller influence on the THOR tibia than on the Hybrid III tibia, causing it to lower the measured lower tibia forces by 17...|$|E
