40|$|Roads {{and traffic}} {{are a major}} non-point source of {{pollutants}} and may have severe impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. In cold climates, <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> is one such pollutant that may cause increased chloride concentrations and induce other effects on the environment. Monitoring and quantifying environmental effects are crucial for governing decisions towards more suitable use of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> {{in order to achieve}} and maintain good environmental status around roads. This thesis presents an operational modelling tool for monitoring the transport and fate of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> in the roadside environment in order to quantify changes in the environment at various spatial and temporal scales, using salt application data, meteorological data, geology and generic descriptions of hydrogeological environments as main inputs. A combination of modelling and various independent field measurements provided an efficient means for evaluating and describing the spread of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> from the road to the surroundings, the deposition of salt and ploughed snow in the roadside, and the corresponding increase in chloride concentration in soil and groundwater. Both the spatial and seasonal variation in soil chloride concentration were significantly affected by <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> application. The importance of type of soil, vegetation type, groundwater conditions and distance from the road was clearly demonstrated for modelling the transport and fate of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> in the roadside environment. Salt emissions from the road by surface runoff were estimated at 50 - 80 % of applied salt and transport by snow ploughing and air emissions at 20 - 50 %. The uncertainty in the spatial distribution of snow and salt deposition close to the road was high and a previous proposed exponential decline in salt deposition with distance from the road could not be justified within a couple of metres from the road. Future monitoring should include both modelling and systematic data collection {{in order to reduce the}} uncertainty in predictions of the environmental impact of <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt.</b> Modelling of chloride concentration, soil water content and soil temperature and measurements of electrical resistivity may be a cost-effective solution for quantifying changes in the roadside environment.

The analysis {{made on the}} basis of 56 cycles scaling Borås test of air-entrained concretes. The levels of water-binder ratio (w/b) : 0. 45 and 0. 38, the partial replacement of cement with fly ash (0, 20, 35, 50 % mass of cement), and kind of siliceous fly ash in three categories of loss on ignition A, B and C were variable in concrete mixes. The results show that apart from air-entraining, which was the sufficient condition to ensure freeze-thaw resistance, also the lowest value of water-binder ratio is necessarily to ensure <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> scaling resistance of fly ash concretes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from validation of models for prediction of chloride ingress in concrete exposed in <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> road environment. Three models including the simple error-function complement (ERFC) model, the DuraCrete model and the ClinConc model, were evaluated using the measurement data collected from both the field exposure site after over ten years exposure and the real road bridges after 25 – 30 years in service. The sensitivity of input parameters in each model is analysed. The results show that, among different input parameters, the age factor is the most sensitive one. The simple ERFC model significantly overestimates chloride ingress. The DuraCrete model, if the input parameters are properly selected, may give a reasonably good prediction, otherwise often underestimates chloride ingress. The ClinConc model in general gives fairly good predictions for chloride ingress in <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> road environment with heavy traffic at high speed...|$|R

The lack of knowledge regarding the long-term performance presents a major obstacle to the growing application of FRPs in bridges. This work aims to investigate the effects of temperature, <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> solutions and moisture on mechanical behavior of Carbon-FRP/steel joints. To realize this aim, forty CFRP/steel double lap shear specimens were aged in simulated <b>de-icing</b> <b>salt</b> solution and deionized water at 20 °C and 45 °C for up to eighteen months.
