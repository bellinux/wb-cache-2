40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the mean values of various intra-arch distances <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I, Class II division 1 and Class II division 2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search engines PubMed, Embrace and Cochrane were employed to select articles for further study, and the sample thereby selected comprised adult subjects with full permanent dentition, without missing teeth, malformations or previous orthodontic treatment. Only subjects from articles published during the last 10 years {{were included in the}} study. RESULTS: The search located a total of 628 articles regarding arch form. However, only eight articles were chosen for the study. We observed that: the distance between mandibular canines is smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II division 1; mandibular inter-molar distance is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I and Class II division 1; maxillary inter-canine distance is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I, Class II division 2 and Class II division 1; maxillary inter-premolar width is greater <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II division 1; and that maxillary inter-molar width is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I and Class II division 2. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in arch width were found between the different classes analysed (there are only slightly differences between <b>classes),</b> except <b>in</b> the case of mandibular inter-canine width (L 3), which was smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II, 1, and maxillary inter-premolar width (U 4), which was smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II-I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I...|$|R

5|$|Free basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households <b>in</b> <b>classes</b> 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. <b>In</b> <b>classes</b> like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together <b>in</b> <b>classes.</b> Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E

The newest admitted class, the class of 2014, consists of 147 students with an incoming GPA of 3.38 and a median LSAT score of 159.
