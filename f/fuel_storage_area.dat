According to the FFACO (1996), CASs are sites potentially requiring corrective action(s) and may include solid waste management units or individual disposal or release sites. A CAU consists of one or more CASs grouped together based on geography, technical similarity, or agency responsibility for the purpose of determining corrective actions.

40|$|Many Nuclear Safeguards {{applications}} {{can benefit}} from interactive design and simulation tools {{to be used by}} planners and inspectors at headquarters. Virtual Reality technologies provide the capability to create accurate, realistic and immersive environments, as well as create ¿objects¿ ¿ representing equipment, measurement devices and radiation sources, with specific properties and behaviours. To be adapted to Safeguards, applications need to reflect the equipment, functions (including the laws of Physics) and procedures that are ultimately used in the field. The paper presents the development of a virtual reality based prototype aimed at simulating the selection, installation, configuration and usage of Safeguards equipment. Examples include surveillance cameras and radiation detection equipment. Design and simulation are achieved by using these devices in realistic environments, including the presence of virtual radioactive sources. Application scenarios include: (a) the design of a Safeguards approach for a given installation; (b) the determination of the most appropriate location to install equipment (e. g., surveillance cameras); (c) the interactive evaluation of equipment¿s effectiveness for specific applications and scenarios; (d) training on the use of specific equipment ¿ e. g., using radiation detection equipment. The paper details an application involving the simulation of surveillance cameras for spent <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>areas.</b> The system enables the interactive selection of the location (i. e., position and orientation) of cameras as well as their optical setup ¿ lens selection. In a second phase, radiation detectors are implemented. The user is presented with an interface replicating the real instrument.

Corrective Action Unit 321 {{is located at the}} Nevada Test Site (NTS) in Area 22, and consists of a single Corrective Action Site (CAS) 22 - 99 - 05, <b>Fuel</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Area.</b> This CAS contains a <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> approximately 325 by 540 feet, which was used to store fuel and other petroleum products necessary for motorized operations at the historical Camp Desert Rock facility, which was operational from 1951 to 1958. The corrective action investigation conducted in February 1999 found the only contaminant of concern above preliminary action levels to be total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics at two sample locations. During this investigation, the two corrective action objectives identified were (1) to prevent or mitigate exposure to near-surface soil containing contaminants of concern, and (2) to prevent spread of contaminants of concern beyond the corrective action unit. Based on the corrective action objectives, the two corrective action alternatives developed for consideration were: Alternative 1 - No Further Action; and Alternative 2 - Clean Closure by Excavation and Disposal. The two alternatives were evaluated based on four general corrective action standards and five remedy selection decision factors, and the preferred corrective action alternative chosen on technical merit, focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety was Alternative 2. This alternative meets all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will eliminate potential future exposure pathways to the contaminated soils at the Weather Station Fuel Storage site...|$|E
40|$|A Vapour cloud {{explosion}} {{which occurred}} in a large <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>area</b> close to the harbour of Naples (Italy) was analysed by different methods. Useful ‘experimental data’ were obtained by the post-accident damage analysis (minimum overpressure experienced by different items) and by the seismograms recorded at different stations {{at the time of}} explosion (explosion duration and intensity). The analysis of the seismic data allowed a first estimate of the amount of vaporized fuel. A more accurate estimate was obtained by modelling the rate of evaporation of the liquid fuel and the vapour cloud dispersion in the surrounding atmosphere. The dispersion calculation furnished the input data for the CFD gas explosion simulator AutoReagas and constituted the basis for a sensitivity analysis of the results to the amount of fuel involved in the explosion. The results obtained with the different methods above were critically discussed and compared to the results obtained with the Multi-Energy method...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 12 November, the North Vietnamese {{launched}} {{the first of many}} rocket attacks against the Đắk Tô airfield, firing 44 missiles. By 08:00 on 15 November, three C-130 Hercules transport aircraft were in the turnaround area as a PAVN mortar barrage landed. Two of them were destroyed. The resulting fires and additional incoming mortars set the ammunition dump and <b>fuel</b> <b>storage</b> <b>areas</b> ablaze. Explosions continued all day and into the night. During that night's incoming shelling, a mortar round landed on two steel containers of C-4 plastic explosive. They detonated simultaneously, sending a fireball and mushroom cloud high above the valley and leaving two craters 40 feet deep. This was said to be the largest explosion to occur in the Vietnam War, knocking men off their feet over a mile away. The explosion destroyed the entire 15th Light Equipment Company compound next to the ammunition dump although no one was killed. Engineer Lieutenant Fred Dyerson thought [...] "it looked like Charlie had gotten hold of some nuclear weapons." [...] Although more than 1,100 tons of ordnance were destroyed during the explosions and fires, this was as close as the North Vietnamese would get to taking Dak To. The rapid deployment of allied forces had upset the North Vietnamese offensive and had thrown them onto the defensive. Previous actions had battered the 66th and 33rd PAVN Regiments, and they began a southwesterly retreat, covered by the 174th Regiment. The Americans and the ARVN then began to run into tenacious rearguard actions.To prevent a repetition of the artillery attack against its base camp, the 4th Division's 3rd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was ordered to take Hill 1338, which had an excellent overview of Đắk Tô, only six kilometers away. For two days, the Americans fought their way up the steep slope of the hill and into the most elaborate bunker complex yet discovered, all of the fortifications of which were connected by field telephones.After scouring the area of the North Vietnamese who attacked Task Force Black, the three companies of 1/503 moved southwest to occupy Hill 882. The force was accompanied by approximately a dozen civilian news correspondents. On the morning of 15 November, the lead company crested the hill and discovered bunkers connected by telephone wire. They were then attacked, {{and the rest of the}} Americans rushed to the hilltop to take defensive positions. PAVN troops poured small arms, machine gun, and mortar fire on the Americans and launched several ground attacks. The U.S. commander requested helicopter evacuation for the most seriously wounded, but this request was denied by Colonel Schumacher, who demanded that the civilians be evacuated first. When the fighting ceased on 19 November the U.S. battalion had suffered seven killed and 34 wounded. The North Vietnamese 66th Regiment left behind 51 dead.|$|R
