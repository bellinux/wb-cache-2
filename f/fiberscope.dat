25|$|Optical fiber is {{also used}} in imaging optics. A {{coherent}} bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin imaging device called an endoscope, {{which is used to}} view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see <b>fiberscope</b> or borescope) are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many microscopes use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} or optical fibre is a flexible, {{transparent}} fiber made by drawing glass (silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker {{than that of}} a human hair. Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than wire cables. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss; in addition, fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, a problem from which metal wires suffer excessively. Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging, and are often wrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry light into, or images out of confined spaces, {{as in the case of}} a <b>fiberscope.</b> Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968) of Germany {{introduced}} the first semi-flexible gastroscope. This device had numerous lenses positioned throughout {{the tube and}} a miniature light bulb at the distal tip. The tube of this device was 75 centimeters long and 11 millimeters in diameter, and the distal portion was capable of {{a certain degree of}} flexion. Between 1945 and 1952, optical engineers (particularly Karl Storz (1911–1996) of the Karl Storz GmbH company of Germany, Harold Hopkins (1918–1995) of England and Mutsuo Sugiura of the Japanese Olympus Corporation) built upon this early work, leading {{to the development of the}} first [...] "gastrocamera". In 1964, Fernando Alves Martins (born 17 June 1927) of Portugal applied optical fiber technology to one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first gastrocamera with a flexible <b>fiberscope.</b> Initially used in esophagogastroduodenoscopy, newer devices were developed in the late 1960s for use in bronchoscopy, rhinoscopy and laryngoscopy. The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development and application of miniaturized two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopes ("two-photon fiberscopes"). Two-photon <b>fiberscopes</b> have been developed {{with the aim of}} enabling high-resolution imaging of neural activity in freely behaving animals. They use fiber optics to deliver laser light for two-photon excitation. Their small front piece typically contains a miniature scanning mechanism and imaging optics. Two-photon <b>fiberscopes</b> can be made sufficiently small and lightweight to be carried by rats and mice and to allow virtually unrestricted movement within a behavioral arena. Typically mounted to the animal's skull above a cranial window, two-photon <b>fiberscopes</b> permit imaging of cells down to at least 250 µm below the brain surface (e. g., in rat neocortex). In freely exploring animals, action-potential-evoked calcium transients can be imaged in individual somata of visual cortex neurons bulk-labeled with a calcium indicator. Two-photon <b>fiberscopes</b> thus enable high-resolution optical recording of neural activity with cellular resolution during natural behaviors...|$|R
30|$|Introduction Single-Use <b>Fiberscopes</b> (SUF) have {{recently}} become available for ICU clinical practice to overcome 3 main {{problems associated with}} Re-Usable <b>Fiberscopes</b> (RUF) resulting in systematic: immediate availability of a sterile device, short lag time to endoscopic treatment and removal of the cross contamination risk. However endoscopy of the upper airway and lung (EAWL) is a medical act that generates significant costs. We thus conducted a medico-economical evaluation of RUF versus SUF.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} in the ICU of a single institution (University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France) that had 16 beds. Two reusable <b>fiberscopes,</b> an Olympus® LF-TP (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and a Pentax® FI- 16 BS (Pentax France, Argenteuil), were available {{for all kinds of}} airways management. They were listed as <b>fiberscopes</b> 1 and 2 (Fib 1 and Fib 2). The single-use Ambu® aScope™ was available for PT only. The study was performed between August 2009 and July 2014. All procedures (BAL and PT) were performed in the ICU by senior physicians.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fiberscopes</b> work by {{utilizing}} {{the science of}} fiber-optic bundles, which consist of numerous fiber-optic cables. Fiber-optic cables are made of optically pure glass and are as thin as a human’s hair. The three main components of a fiber-optic cable are: ...|$|R

50|$|Rigid borescopes {{are similar}} to <b>fiberscopes</b> but {{generally}} provide a superior image at lower cost compared to a flexible borescope. Rigid borescopes have the limitation that access to {{what is to be}} viewed must be in a straight line. Rigid borescopes are therefore better suited to certain tasks such as inspecting automotive cylinders, fuel injectors and hydraulic manifold bodies, and gunsmithing.|$|R

50|$|A {{flexible}} Videoscope or Video Borescope is {{an advanced}} type of borescope that houses {{a very small}} CCD chip embedded into {{the tip of the}} scope. The video image is relayed from the distal tip and focusable lens assembly back to the display via internal wiring. This is unlike a traditional borescope and <b>fiberscope.</b> Borescopes use hard optical relay components to transfer the image from the tip to an eyepiece and Fiberscopes use coherent image fiberoptics to relay the image to one's eye through an eyepiece. The image quality of a videoscope is superior to a <b>fiberscope</b> and could be compared to that of a high-end Video Camcorder.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fiberscope</b> is a {{flexible}} fiber-optic bundle with an eyepiece {{on one end}} and a lens on the other {{that is used to}} examine and inspect small, difficult-to-reach places such as the insides of machines, locks, and the human body.|$|E

40|$|The Olympus Optical Company of Japan {{was formed}} in 1919, with the {{introduction}} of the first generation single lens reflects camera, and soon after with the first microscope. Since that time, the organisation has developed and is now split into three main divisions: manufacturing and supplying cameras, microscopes and endoscopes. Other smaller specialist divisions exist suppling such products as dictaphones. Perhaps, rather surprisingly, the endoscope division is the largest part of the organisation. Through a world-wide organisation of four main business centers, Olympus Industrial, the name given to the industrial endoscope division, provides service and support to its customers. Each of the main business centers operates through agents and distributors. There are many different industries which gain the benefits of saved time and money provided by using endoscopes. To meet the needs of so many varied industries, {{there is a need to}} have a wide range of equipment. This includes light sources, to provide illumination, rigid borescopes, flexible <b>fiberscopes,</b> if views around corners are needed, and the new technology videoscopes. These instruments use the latest CCD technology with a small chip situated in the distal end of the scope, instead of fiberoptic image bundles used in <b>fiberscopes.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>fiberscope</b> {{is mainly}} used for medical purposes, {{it is also}} used for other purposes. Locksmiths use them to check the {{position}} of pins; technicians and inspectors use them {{to look at the}} inside of machines; they can be used to check beneath doors or otherwise perform surveillance.|$|E
50|$|To achieve {{higher quality}} {{photographs}} or films, rigid endoscopes were more suitable {{because of the}} quality of the images. An example of this was the rod-lens endoscope invented by Harold Hopkins. The more flexible fiber-optic endoscope, called <b>fiberscope</b> or flexoscope, made from bundled glass fibers do not produce the same quality pictures.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flexible}} borescope {{includes a}} bundle of optical fibers which divide the image into pixels.

50|$|Cotton {{was born}} in England, where {{his father was a}} rural family physician. He was educated at Cambridge University and St. Thomas Hospital Medical School (London) where he {{graduated}} in 1963. He became interested in endoscopy in the late 1960s with the introduction of flexible <b>fiberscopes,</b> and developed endoscopy units at St. Thomas’ Hospital and at the Middlesex Hospital, which pioneered and evaluated many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly ERCP. He attracted postgraduates from many countries, held numerous teaching courses, and introduced live CCTV workshops.|$|R

50|$|The game is {{more focused}} on {{tactical}} gameplay than standard shooter video games. A major component {{of the game is}} identifying and tagging enemies inside rooms before entering the room. The player can use a <b>fiberscope</b> to look through the door of room, and tag two enemies. Then, when the door is opened (either by kicking or by throwing in a smoke grenade), the two NPCs in the player's squad will immediately target the tagged enemies. This facilitates a more tactical approach to the game than in other Gameloft shooters, such as Modern Combat.|$|E
50|$|Guiding {{of light}} by refraction, the {{principle}} that makes fiber optics possible, was first demonstrated by Daniel Colladon and Jacques Babinet in Paris in the early 1840s. Then in 1930, Heinrich Lamm, a German medical student, became {{the first person to}} put together a bundle of optical fibers to carry an image. These discoveries led to the invention of endoscopes and fiberscopes.In the 1960s the endoscope was upgraded with glass fiber, a flexible material that allowed light to transmit, even when bent. While this provided users with the capability of real-time observation, it did not provide them with the ability to take photographs. In 1964 the <b>fiberscope,</b> the first gastro camera, was invented. It was the first time an endoscope had a camera that could take pictures. This innovation led to more careful observations, and more accurate diagnoses.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{mentioned in}} the second type is mainly used to improve the image quality of flexible endoscopes, replacing traditional <b>fiberscopes.</b> Nevertheless, laparoscopes are rigid endoscopes. The rigidity is required in clinical practice. The rod-lens based laparoscopes dominant overwhelmingly in practice, due to their fine optical resolution (50 µm typically, dependant on the aperture size used in the objective lens), and the image quality can be better {{than that of the}} digital camera if necessary. The second type of laparoscope is very rare in the laparoscope market and in hospitals.|$|R

Standalone VF recorders & players were also used by television stations and video production studios as a still-store system for stills & graphics for use in a television production, or for on-air slides used for station identification or during technical difficulties (such as a [...] "Please Stand By" [...] still).|$|R
