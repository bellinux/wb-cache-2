5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, <b>electroslag</b> <b>welding,</b> electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

The results of multiple el ectrode <b>electroslag</b> <b>welds</b> made with and {{without the use of}} a supplementary filler material are presented as well. Methods of reducing the size of the heat affected zone while maintaining an acceptable form factor were determined.

In addition, problems with <b>electroslag</b> <b>welds,</b> while not isolated to tied-arch bridges, resulted in costly, time-consuming and inconveniencing repairs. The structure as a whole was described as [...] nonredundant; failure of either of the two tie girders would result in failure of the entire structure.|$|R
40|$|Stainless steels often exhibit complex {{transformation}} and precipitation behaviour {{due to a}} high content of alloying elements. Secondary phases can be formed in the temperature range of 300 - 1000 °C and are generally undesirable due to their detrimental effect on mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of stainless steels. Of all precipitate types, sigma phase is the major concern due to its effect on both toughness and resistance to corrosion. However, {{the effect of the}} phase itself cannot be separated from that of associated changes in the surrounding matrix if macroscopic techniques are used. The situation is similar for investigations of chromium nitrides, which are the precipitated phases frequently observed in high nitrogen stainless steels. High resolution techniques are required to characterize such small individual precipitates to be able to examine their actual effect on the corrosion resistance of stainless steels.   In this work, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) were used to investigate the magnetic properties and the Volta potential difference of precipitated phases. The magnetic domain distribution was used to distinguish between ferrite (ferromagnetic), austenite (paramagnetic), and sigma phase (non-magnetic). The Volta potential differences reflect the relative nobility of the phases and thus their tendency to corrode. The MFM and SKPFM techniques are shown to achieve a high lateral resolution of at least 100 nm. This means that small particles or precipitated phases can be characterized separately from the surrounding matrix.   Two grades of duplex stainless steels, the standard 2205 and the super duplex 2507, and an <b>electroslag</b> strip <b>weld</b> with a multi-phase microstructure were investigated using a combination of local probing techniques. The duplex stainless steels underwent various heat treatments to precipitate a sufficient amount of secondary phases. Scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron mode and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy yielded information on the phase distribution and chemical composition of individual phases. Detailed marking of the surfaces was used so that exactly the same areas could be investigated with the MFM and SKPFM techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also employed to characterize the chemical composition of depleted phase boundaries.     The general observation is that, austenite exhibited a higher Volta potential compared with ferrite, most likely due to a higher nickel content in the austenite phase. When sigma phase was present, it showed an intermediate Volta potential between the austenite and ferrite phases. This indicates that austenite is, in general, more noble than sigma phase, and that ferrite is the most active phase. However, austenite showed a lower Volta potential than sigma phase when a long-term isothermal heat treatment at 800 °C was used. This is attributed to the depletion of alloying elements in the austenite phase {{as a result of the}} formation of chromium nitrides and sigma phase. Synergistic interactions between chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen may contribute to the effect on the Volta potential, since such small changes of these elements result in reversed Volta potentials of the austenite and sigma phase.   Results from SKPFM and TEM analyses are in concordance and indicate local drops in Volta potential at the phase boundaries due to the depletion of alloying elements caused by sigma phase formation. Immersion tests in acidic mixtures also confirmed that these depleted regions are more susceptible to selective corrosion.   Precipitated chromium nitrides showed a higher Volta potential compared with the other phases. This indicates that any deterioration in the corrosion resistance is unlikely caused by the nitride particles themselves, but rather by the alloying element depleted regions surrounding the nitride particles. The size of nitride particles affected the measured Volta potential, and the measured Volta potentials of small particles are tended to be concealed by the surrounding matrix. When the size of nitride particles is below the resolution limit of the SKPFM technique, the Volta potential differences of these particles relative to the matrix could not be detected.   Volta potential measured in air with the SKPFM technique correlated better to the tendency to active dissolution than to pitting corrosion in acidic mixtures. The magnetic force showed a certain influence on the electrostatic force, thus Volta potential measurements are recommended to be performed with a non-magnetic tip. Although many factors may affect the measured Volta potential, the SKFPM technique combined with other local probing techniques is a promising approach to evaluate corrosion tendency of precipitated phases in multi-phase alloys. With optimal conditions, the detectable size was down to approximately 100 nm. QC 2010051...|$|R

50|$|Electrogas welding (EGW) is a {{continuous}} vertical position arc welding process developed in 1961, {{in which an}} arc is struck between a consumable electrode and the workpiece. A shielding gas is sometimes used, but pressure is not applied. A major difference between EGW and its cousin <b>electroslag</b> <b>welding</b> is that the arc in EGW is not extinguished, instead remains struck throughout the welding process.

(ESW) is similar to electrogas welding, but the main difference is the arc starts in a different location. An electric arc is initially struck by wire that is fed into the desired weld location and then flux is added. Additional flux is added until the molten slag, reaching {{the tip of the}} electrode, extinguishes the arc.

It can also be used on structural steel if certain precautions are observed.

The electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable electrode guide tube, like the one used in <b>electroslag</b> <b>welding,</b> or a moving head. When the consumable guide tube is used, the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded, the electrode, and the guide tube.
