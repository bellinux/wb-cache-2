The energy efficient fans {{will be available to}} the consumers on an upfront payment of Rs. 1,150/- per fan. EESL has distributed 6.2 lakh energy efficient fans under this scheme which will result in an energy savings of over 2.4 lakh kWh per day and a monetary savings of Rs 8.2 lakh per day to the consumers. The <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> of the fan (between efficient and inefficient one) is Rs. 500 which is the primary reason for its low penetration along with the lack of awareness. With the usage of these energy efficient fans it is estimated that consumer’s electricity bills will reduce by about Rs. 700-730 per year thus making the cost recovery in less than 2 years.|$|E

40|$|Food {{prices and}} food {{affordability}} are important determinants of food choices, obesity and non-communicable diseases. As governments {{around the world}} consider policies to promote the consumption of healthier foods, data on the relative price and affordability of foods, with a particular focus on the difference between ‘less healthy’ and ‘healthy’ foods and diets, are urgently needed. This paper briefly reviews past and current approaches to monitoring food prices, and identifies key issues affecting the development of practical tools and methods for food price data collection, analysis and reporting. A step-wise monitoring framework, including measurement indicators, is proposed. ‘Minimal’ data collection will assess the <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ foods; ‘expanded’ monitoring will assess the <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ diets; and the ‘optimal’ approach will also monitor food affordability, by taking into account household income. The monitoring of the price and affordability of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ foods and diets globally will provide robust data and benchmarks to inform economic and fiscal policy responses. Given the range of methodological, cultural and logistical challenges in this area, {{it is imperative that}} all aspects of the proposed monitoring framework are tested rigorously before implementation.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that {{limited access to}} essential medicines undermines efforts at improving the health and economic well-being of low-income populations. This has spurred {{on a number of}} solutions, including <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> based on the economics of price discrimination. A desirable feature of <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> is its potential ability to reconcile static and dynamic efficiency concerns. There are, however, various shades of <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> and this paper aims to evaluate their consistency with economic theory. Starting with the report of the workshop on 'Differential Pricing and Financing of Essential Drugs' held by secretariats of the World Trade Organization and WHO in Hosbjor, Norway, in 2001, this paper takes issue with how <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> has been defined as a tool for improving access to essential drug benefits. The paper notes that inadequate attention has been given to policies and institutional arrangements for creating, expressing and maintaining 'truly' price-elastic demands in low-income nations and for segmenting markets. In addition, considerations of equity and solidarity have distracted policy advocates from balancing conflicting, yet well intended, views and general rules. The paper argues why <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> should be implemented via country-specific bilateral negotiated discounts. It maintains that it is feasible to muster an environment conducive to profitable <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> whilst satisfying general rules and concerns about self-reliance, transparency, accountability, equity and solidarity. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Inadequate {{access to}} {{medicine}} {{is a key}} public health issue. It violates the basic human right, and impedes economics development and social progress. <b>Differential</b> <b>pricing</b> means to charge according to variant ability {{to pay for the}} same products. Since <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> has been successfully used into many business sectors, its adoption in pharmaceutical industry seems to be necessary and feasible to help improve access to medicine for developing countries. Objective This project is to review the effect of “differential pricing “in pharmaceutical industry and to discuss its current situation and future development. Methodology A literature review was conducted on this topic. Keywords of “(Tiered OR differential OR segment*) AND (price*) AND (developing countries) AND (pharmacy OR drug OR medicine OR vaccine) ” were used in databases of Pubmed, Medline and Google scholar for relevant studies and reports on <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> in pharmaceutical or vaccine markets. Result A total of 16 papers were included into this systematic review. In theory, <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> is a “win-win” solution with the ability to reconcile both static and dynamic costs. In practice, <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> works to help improve access, however, lower tiered price for patent drugs is still more expensive than generic drugs in most cases. Conclusion <b>Differential</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy has the potential to improve access to medicine. However it is still in an infancy stage, there are still lots of spaces for further improvement. Except for pricing policies, other mutual supportive policies also need to obtain a better access to medicine in developing countries. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

The total sample meta-analysis lends stronger support of the association of risk aversion and hedging instruments with the controversial relation between exchange volatility and exports widely expected either theoretically or empirically. Then, subgroup meta- analysis is used to provide further evidence on the results already obtained by decomposing our sample into four subgroups depending to the nature of countries and the models explored to determine volatility. The evidence from subgroups is not supportive of this association. Furthermore and contrary to expectations, neither <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> volatility, nor asymmetry, nor nonlinearities are significantly linked to conflicting results. ...|$|E

Analyzing such policies using the spatial competition models of location theory reveals that they may create incentives/or long-run changes in location that subvert the mode choice impact of the policies.

In contrast, if individuals continue to use despite increased prices, taxation may serve to reduce the welfare of these individuals while providing no benefits in managing self control nor mitigating externalities. We use data on adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to {{examine the impact of}} tobacco taxes on smoking. To account for unobserved heterogeneity in response to taxes we estimate finite mixture models, positing two types of individuals with differential responses to taxes. We find evidence of <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> elasticity for tobacco use across the adolescents groups, and show that individuals with low self control or high discount rates are largely unresponsive to cigarette price. Those who have the least willpower may need the most help in quitting but are unresponsive to taxes, suggesting that policies other than taxation may be needed to reduce adolescent tobacco use. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{analysis}} of monopoly third-degree price discrimination to the empirically important case where marginal costs also differ between markets. <b>Differential</b> <b>pricing</b> then reallocates output to the lower-cost markets, hence welfare can increase even if total output does not, unlike under pure price discrimination. To induce output reallocation the firm varies its prices but [...] -again, unlike under pure price discrimination [...] -with no upward bias in the average price. Due to this <b>price</b> dispersion, <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> motivated solely by cost differences will increase consumer surplus (and total welfare) for a broad class of demand functions.

40|$|Governments {{are often}} {{reluctant}} to make welfare payments to poor households {{in the form of}} unrestricted cash transfers, favouring instead in-kind transfers of goods or services, such as food aid or public housing. One rationale for making in-kind transfers is that they encourage consumption of the ‘right’ things, such as healthy food. On the flipside, cash transfers are typically less expensive to administer, and cash can provide recipients with greater freedom over purchasing choices. Another important but often overlooked aspect of this policy trade-off is that transfer programmes can affect local prices. Both cash and in-kind transfers make recipients better off, which can increase their demand for goods and, in turn, has an effect on prices. However, in-kind transfers also increase the local supply of goods, which can drive prices down. We have recently empirically measured the <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> effects of cash and in-kind transfers, and have demonstrated how they affect the recipient communities (Cunha, De Giorgi and Jayachandran, 2012) ...|$|E

40|$|The ongoing net {{neutrality}} debate has generated {{a lot of}} heated discussions {{on whether or not}} monetary interactions should be regulated between content and access providers. Among the several topics discussed, `differential pricing' has recently received attention due to `zero-rating' platforms proposed by some service providers.

Low market integration between primary/assembly markets and consumer/regional markets is due not only to delays in produce transfer, resulting from bad road accessibility (distance and state of roads, and therefore travel times and transport costs), but also to the heterogeneity of critical marketing tools such as units of weight/volume of measurement (Temple and Dury 2003, Thodey 1969). <b>Differential</b> <b>price</b> and margin appraisal capacity of customers is also a probable explanation.

A very traditional food like egusi in shells illustrates the low market integration situation of this type of foods. Indeed, there are delays and lack of accuracy in the transmission of market information, especially for such raw/traditional food. On the contrary, all rural markets in Allada are quite uniformly integrated for vegetal oil, palm oil, and maize because those foods are well known to all market actors and are regularly and widely traded.|$|E
