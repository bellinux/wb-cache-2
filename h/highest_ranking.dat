40|$|We {{prove that}} any action of a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice on a Gromov-hyperbolic space is elementary. More precisely, {{it is either}} {{elliptic}} or parabolic. This is a large generalization {{of the fact that}} any action of a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice on a tree has a fixed point. A consequence is that any quasi-action of a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice on a tree is elliptic, i. e. it has Manning's property (QFA). Moreover, we obtain a new proof of the theorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur that any morphism from a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice to a mapping class group has finite image, without relying on the Margulis normal subgroup theorem nor on bounded cohomology. More generally, we prove that any morphism from a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice to a hierarchically hyperbolic group has finite image. In the Appendix, Vincent Guirardel and Camille Horbez deduce rigidity results for morphisms from a <b>higher</b> <b>rank</b> lattice to various outer automorphism groups.
