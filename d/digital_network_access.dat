40|$|In this {{communication}} we {{deal with}} wireless local loop (WJ.,L) systems using spread spectrum techniques to provide Integrated Services <b>Digital</b> <b>Networks</b> (ISDN) local <b>access.</b> We consider the dimensioning of a base station intended to serve various lSDN subscribers. The connection between subscribers and base station i s achieved via atmospheric channel and the transmission technique used is Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum - DS/SS). An expression that permits the calculation of a maximum number of users that a base station can serve in function of the desired qualicj of service (QoS) and mean traffic per user is derived. Based on this formulation we present numerical results, on the QoS for values of bit error probability required by ISDN and typical mean traffic {{of this kind of}} application...|$|R

This standard presents the electrical characteristics of the integrated services <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> (ISDN) basic <b>access</b> signals appearing at the network side of the NT.

40|$|As {{the spread}} of <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> makes <b>access</b> to data {{communications}} globally available, the interest of communication service providers is switching away from the provision of these bearer networks and towards the provision of the value added services that will operate over them. At {{the same time the}} liberalisation of telecommunication markets is precipitating a dramatic change in the profile of communication service providers. In this complex telecommunications markets the open management, not only of the networks, but of the services themselves will become increasingly important. The large number and diversity of roles of the market players makes the management of inter-organisational relationships fundamentally important to the management of services. The ITU's series of recommendations on the telecommunication management network (TMN) provides a basis for inter-domain management, however, this and other standards have so far concentrated on the management of individual network components and of networks operated by single organisations. This paper provides an initial example of how the management of multiple services in a complex multi-player market can be modelled using TMN techniques for implementation on existing management platforms. The paper begins by briefly outlining current work in this field before describing aspects of this multi-player multi-service management problem and how they can be modelled and implemented in a real system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} that provides remote control to Open Inventor or Cosmo 3 D based visualization applications. A visualization server distributes a visualization session to Java based clients by transmitting compressed images from the server frame buffer. Visualization parameters and GUI events from the clients are applied to the server application by sending CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) requests. The framework provides transparent access to remote visualization capabilities and allows sharing of expensive resources. Additionally the framework opens new possibilities for collaborative work and distance education. We present a teleradiology system and an automotive development application which {{make use of the}} proposed techniques. 1 Introduction The rapid evolution of todays <b>digital</b> communication <b>networks</b> enables <b>access</b> to a huge amount of scientific data and remote computation capabilities, like shared memory multiprocessor machines o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|City {{managers}} in several cities {{have tried to}} market their city related to information technology; i. e. Osaka as a city of intelligence, Barcelona as a city of telematics, Amsterdam as a city of information, Manchester as a wired city (Hepworth, 1990 : 550 ff), and more recently, Stockholm as the mobile valley or internet bay. These attempts mirror {{the emergence of a}} space of flows which replaces the notion of the space of places. It poses a challenge for cities to construct new productive infrastructures, thereby turning cities and regions into critical agents of economic development by introducing informational city concepts like the technopoles or technoburbs.

30|$|The {{data set}} used is {{comprised}} of 38 teleseismic broadband P-wave ground motions from stations of the Federation of <b>Digital</b> Seismic <b>Networks</b> (FDSN), <b>accessed</b> through the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) data center. The data were selected from hundreds of available FDSN seismograms to have good azimuthal coverage and several minutes of time after the P arrival preceding the PP phase; this limits epicentral distances to be mainly greater than 50 °. These data thus sample a narrow cone of take-off angles from the source (Fig. 2), and the high apparent velocities of teleseismic P-waves yield limited sensitivity to the absolute location of the features in the source. Differences in the hypocentral location cannot be resolved by the data (all three locations can produce good fits), but moving the location seaward initiates the rupture at shallower depth, and reduces the distance up-grid to the trench. The grid for the model here (P-MOD 2) extended to a trenchward bulge of the upper plate, which causes small overlap of the rectangular source grid with the trench {{to the north and}} south. This geometric compromise allows us to explore slip estimation {{all the way to the}} trench.|$|R

I also show how this is facilitated and what is changed during, and as a result of, these affective interactions. Using a deep understanding of the technical workings of <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> combined with receptiveness to the affective potential of emotional agency in our digital world, I situate human affective practice in the uneasy environment of algorithmic <b>digital</b> corporate <b>networks...</b>|$|R

The first graphic user interface software is to draw the signal flow graph of a 1 -D, 2 -D, or 3 -D <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> using adders, delays, and multipliers. It can extract the graphical representation of a <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> with error checking capability into a netlist for analysis purpose.

This paper examines the interworking of existing LANs and MANs currently under development with the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) oriented B-ISDN (Broadband Integrated Services <b>Digital</b> <b>Networks).</b> The problem examined consists of the following parameters: (i) Alternative ways of connectionless (CL) data service provision by the connection oriented (CO) ATM network; and (ii) bridging protocols at the <b>network</b> <b>access</b> points. For (i), the CCITT scenarios are discussed and critically compared. Regarding (ii), a proposed bridge architecture is presented and its application to different LANs and MANs is investigated. The paper examines and critically compares the above cases, and discusses trade-offs in qualitative terms when different options are possible. © 1992...|$|R
