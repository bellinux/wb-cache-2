40|$|We {{formulate}} {{and prove}} {{an extension of}} Connes's reconstruction theorem for commutative spectral triples to so-called Connes-Landi or isospectral deformations of commutative spectral triples along the action of a compact Abelian Lie group $G$, also known as toric noncommutative manifolds. In particular, we propose an abstract definition for such spectral triples, where noncommutativity is entirely governed by a deformation parameter sitting in the second group cohomology of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, and then show that such spectral triples are well-behaved under further Connes-Landi deformation, thereby allowing for both quantisation from and <b>dequantisation</b> to $G$-equivariant abstract commutative spectral triples. We then use a refinement of the Connes-Dubois-Violette splitting homomorphism to conclude that suitable Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples by a rational deformation parameter are almost-commutative in the general, topologically non-trivial sense.

40|$|New hyperfields, that is {{fields in}} which {{addition}} is multivalued, are introduced and studied. In a separate paper these hyperfields are shown {{to provide a}} base for the tropical geometry. The main hyperfields considered here are classical number sets, such as the set of complex numbers, the set of real numbers, and the set of real non-negative numbers, with the usual multiplications, but new, multivalued additions. The new hyperfields are related with the classical fields and each other by <b>dequantisations.</b> For example, the new complex tropical field is a dequantization {{of the field of}} complex numbers.
