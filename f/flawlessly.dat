5|$|In October 2011, Mayawati {{government}} under public-private partnership with Jaypee Group successfully executed and delivered First F1 Indian Grand Prix, an international event at Buddh International Circuit, Greater Noida constructed by Jaypee Group. The event {{was hailed as}} <b>flawlessly</b> conducted salvaging some of India's prestige when compared to minor embarrassments in 2010 Commonwealth Games (Before opening ceremony) conducted in Delhi. Mayawati presented the winning trophy to winner Sebastian Vettel. Foreigners found the track as 'impressive' and 3 Indian teenagers picked by a F1 panel to train them as future Formula One drivers in Europe.|$|E

Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task <b>flawlessly.</b> For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers <b>flawlessly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM {{ascent stage}} was jettisoned. Because of a failure by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn <b>flawlessly</b> despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E

25|$|The fortress' armaments worked <b>flawlessly</b> {{despite their}} age, sinking the Blücher {{in the sound}} and forcing the German fleet to fall back. The loss of the German flagship, which carried most of the troops and Gestapo agents {{intended}} to occupy Oslo, delayed the German occupation long enough for King Haakon VII and his government {{to escape from the}} capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{was considered}} revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live {{reports in the}} days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost <b>flawlessly.</b> The special became the basis for World News Roundup—broadcasting's oldest news series, which still runs each weekday morning and evening on the CBS Radio Network.|$|E
25|$|Although the smaller, tin lithographed cars by American Flyer, Marx, {{and others}} predate the formal O-27 standard, {{they are also}} often called O-27, because they also operate <b>flawlessly</b> on O-27 track. Marx may have {{dedicated}} its entire line to 0-27, but the Lionel Corporation remains to produce O-27 track and trains. Its tubular rail is a standard of the tinplate era.|$|E
25|$|He {{found the}} {{translating}} wing-sweep mechanism, {{similar to the}} Bell X-5's, (which was {{much more complicated than}} the one later adopted by the F-111, F-14 and Panavia Tornado et al.), to be the only feature that worked <b>flawlessly.</b> The Navy was not encouraged by the results, and the development of larger carriers with angled flight decks and steam-driven catapults made the swing-wing configuration unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{with fine}} sand {{entering}} the Tavor's chamber, which were identified {{over the two}} years of testing, were rectified by numerous small adjustments. A number of other improvements and changes to the design were also made between 2001–2009. Tavor CTAR-21 bullpup assault rifles saw combat service in Operation Cast Lead, used by Givati Brigade and Golani Brigade, and the soldiers reported the Tavor bullpup assault rifles functioned <b>flawlessly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Building {{the camera}} took {{years and was}} delayed several times by NASA. In the spring of 1992, with launch only months away, the camera was {{installed}} on the Mars Observer. The launch was successful and in January 1993 it took some photos but then, the Observer spacecraft ceased operations. Fortunately, MSSS had built a double and so two years later, the double was sent up (in November 1996) and that camera worked <b>flawlessly</b> for the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Russia's aim of {{finishing}} the constellation in 2010 suffered a setback when a December 2010 launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed. The Proton-M itself performed <b>flawlessly,</b> but the upper stage Blok DM3 (a new version {{which was to}} make its maiden flight) was loaded with too much fuel due to a sensor failure. As a result, the upper stage and the three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Kommersant estimated the launch failure cost up to $160 million. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a full audit of the entire $2 billion program and {{an investigation into the}} failure.|$|E
25|$|Although South Bend had {{a four-game}} lead in August, both clubs tied with {{identical}} records of 75–36 {{at the end}} of the year. On September 3, in the final home game of the regular season, Faut hurled her second no-hitter, a 2–0 victory against Fort Wayne. She pitched <b>flawlessly</b> and faced the minimum 27 batters, but still did not qualify for a perfect game, since she allowed an eighth-inning walk to Dorothy Schroeder, who later was erased on a double play. In the playoffs, Rockford eliminated South Bend in four straight games. Faut went 0–2 with a 2.58 ERA in two starts. By edict of league president Max Carey, the playoff victory also made Rockford the regular season champion.|$|E
25|$|One of the helmsman's most {{important}} duties is steering a ship in a harbor or seaport when reduced speeds slow a ship's {{response to the}} rudder. For it is during ship arrivals and departures, when most ship collisions or groundings occur. Clear communication, then, between the officer of the bridge and the helmsman is essential for safe operations. The officer or harbor pilot relies upon the helmsman to <b>flawlessly</b> execute steering commands to avoid a variety of hazards, including man-made obstacles, land formations, grounding in shallow waters, {{and the threat of}} collision with other vessels. In addition, powerful sea tides and river currents encountered in seaports heighten navigation dangers, as a ship's ability to stop is severely limited.|$|E
25|$|Bell is also {{credited}} with developing {{one of the}} early versions of a metal detector in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked <b>flawlessly</b> in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, the Skinny Dragons {{departed}} Oahu for {{the last}} time as a Hawaii squadron. Their 'Aloha Deployment' was a busy one that saw personnel spread across three continents and twelve different countries. The Skinny Dragons executed their mission <b>flawlessly</b> throughout the entire deployment, and everyone from the maintenance professionals, to aircrew and support personnel was instrumental in ensuring their last P-3C Orion deployment was a resounding success. While on deployment, VP-4 executed a Permanent Duty Station Change (PDSC) to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Returning home in September, the Skinny Dragons currently await the start of the transition to the P-8A Poseidon, slated to begin at the end of October. VP-4 proudly looks forward to many more years as the leader in US Navy Maritime Patrol Aviation, emboldened by their motto: Family, Leadership, Integrity.|$|E
25|$|Lockheed Martin {{successfully}} {{conducted the}} first test flight of a prototype NetFires Loitering Attack Missile (LAM) at Eglin Air Force Base, on 11 November 2002. The LAM vertically launched <b>flawlessly,</b> transitioned to stable flight and performed several maneuvers during the short flight test. Test objectives were successfully achieved. The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher. Control surfaces and a pivoting wing deployed as planned as the missile began its programmed assent-phase roll and pitch maneuver. Protective covers on the forward dome, scoring camera and turbojet inlet were ejected properly and engine start sequence began as scheduled. Turbojet ignition sequence completed approximately five seconds after launch, and the engine came up to speed as the prototype approached apogee. For the next eight minutes, the LAM prototype executed preprogrammed maneuvers over the Eglin test range, demonstrating impressive stability and validating aerodynamic performance, navigation and autopilot performance design parameters.|$|E
25|$|The troop carrier {{pilots in}} their remembrances and {{histories}} admitted to many errors in {{execution of the}} drops but denied the aspersions on their character, citing the many factors since enumerated and faulty planning assumptions. Some, such as Martin Wolfe, an enlisted radio operator with the 436th TCG, pointed out that some late drops were caused by the paratroopers, who were struggling to get their equipment out the door until their aircraft had flown by the drop zone by several miles. Others mistook drops made ahead of theirs for their own drop zones and insisted on going early. The TCC personnel {{also pointed out that}} anxiety at being new to combat was not confined to USAAF crews. Warren reported that official histories showed 9 paratroopers had refused to jump and at least 35 other uninjured paratroopers were returned to England aboard C-47s. General Gavin reported that many paratroopers were in a daze after the drop, huddling in ditches and hedgerows until prodded into action by veterans. Wolfe noted that although his group had botched the delivery of some units in the night drop, it flew a second, daylight mission on D-Day and performed <b>flawlessly</b> although under heavy ground fire from alerted Germans.|$|E

500|$|Rostislavs hull was {{launched}} on September 2, 1896. Lack of proper cranes in Nikolaev made {{the installation of}} its engines exceedingly difficult, {{to the point that}} the navy even considered towing the hull to Sevastopol for completion. The Nikolaev engineers eventually resolved the problem and the ship was ready to sail in July 1897. Rostislav conducted her speed trials on October 21, 1898, still missing her main guns. Her power plant performed <b>flawlessly,</b> but its weight exceeded the design target by more than [...]|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Union {{artillery}} fire was planned and directed nearly <b>flawlessly.</b> As historian Jennings Cropper Wise notes, Col. Hunt, McClellan's chief of artillery, continuously refocused Union fire on various fronts, in an [...] "enormous sheaf of fire {{of more than}} 50 superior pieces, disabling four of Huger's and several of Jackson's batteries almost the instant they came into action". This severely hampered the Confederates' ability to respond effectively to the Federal barrage. The Union artillery subdued {{a number of the}} Southerners' batteries; those few that remained attacked piecemeal, and failed to produce any significant result.|$|E

[...] He noted that [...] " [...] can listen to this track a dozen times and still pluck something new from the richly layered arrangement", while highlighting Madonna's vocals, writing that she [...] "performs with a confidence that allows her to <b>flawlessly</b> merge a widened vocal range with a considerable dose of raw emotion and soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Bianca Gracie from Idolator website {{wrote that}} [...] "Bedtime Stories proved that Madonna never lost her edge; she {{just decided to}} soften it so that her image could regroup. When {{listening}} to the sultry undertones and R influences threaded throughout it, you come to realize how <b>flawlessly</b> the singer could change up her persona while still sounding genuine". Gracie believed that Bedtime Stories was an album with [...] "timeless sound" [...] and signified an evolution of Madonna as an artist, acting as the front-runner to her more experimental album like Ray of Light (1998). However she noted how the album never {{let go of the}} sexual provocation associated with Madonna and how the singer chose to turn against what people expected from her at that time—being apologetic.|$|E

Pete Paphides, writing for The Times, {{said that the}} songs were performed [...] "with power and restraint", while Johnny Davis, writing for The Observer, said [...] "ou can practically hear Katherine Jenkins weep as Faryl <b>flawlessly</b> executes Amazing Grace". Jason Birchmeier, writing for Allmusic, considered Smith's performance even more noteworthy because of her young age. However, though he considered Smith's voice impressive, Malcolm Mackenzie, writing for The London Paper, asked [...] "will we care when the kid from Kettering loses her precocious appeal?" [...] Reviewers also responded positively to Cohen's contribution to the album.

500|$|GameSpot {{noted that}} while Year of the Dragon made no {{significant}} {{changes to the}} formula of its predecessors, the combination of new playable characters, more detailed graphics, and the variety of minigames made the game worth buying. IGN praised the game's appeal to all ages and the polished levels, {{as well as the}} successful multi-character focus. Game Revolution thought that while the game's premise itself was simply a rehash of previous titles, [...] "the story that unfolds as you actually play the game is <b>flawlessly</b> interwoven and quite entertaining". GamePro noted that the ability of the game to automatically drop the difficulty if players get stuck was an excellent feature. Next Generation Magazines Kevin Rice provided one of the most positive reviews in which he stated the top-notch level design, intuitive controls and excellent graphics made the title the best Spyro game to date, and arguably the best PlayStation game overall.|$|E
500|$|Tung's men charged {{forward in}} a V-shaped riot formation. According to Halberstam, [...] "they pranced into the pagoda, looking {{something}} like a smart football team coming up {{to the line of}} scrimmage". In the end, it took around two hours to complete the raids because many of the occupants had entrenched themselves inside the various rooms in anticipation of the attacks and doors had to be unhinged to reach them. According to journalist Neil Sheehan, who was at the scene, [...] "The raid on Xá Lợi, like those on the pagodas elsewhere in South Vietnam, was <b>flawlessly</b> executed. It reminded me of a scene from a movie of the French Resistance—the scene when the Gestapo arrive at the Resistance hideout in Paris."

500|$|Priestley {{was born}} to an {{established}} English Dissenting family (i.e. they did not conform to the Church of England) in Birstall, near Batley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the oldest of six children born to Mary Swift and Jonas Priestley, a finisher of cloth. To ease his mother's burdens, Priestley was sent {{to live with his}} grandfather around the age of one. He returned home, five years later, after his mother died. When his father remarried in 1741, Priestley went to live with his aunt and uncle, the wealthy and childless Sarah and John Keighley, [...] from Fieldhead. Because Priestley was precocious—at the age of four he could <b>flawlessly</b> recite all 107 questions and answers of the Westminster Shorter Catechism—his aunt sought the best education for the boy, intending him for the ministry. During his youth, Priestley attended local schools where he learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.|$|E
500|$|Normally, {{bombs are}} cheap and fuses are {{relatively}} expensive, but {{an atomic bomb}} is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within [...] of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica tail warning radar known as [...] "Archie" [...] was employed, and the fuses performed <b>flawlessly</b> in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival in}} London, Bohr rejoined his father, who had flown to Britain the week before. He officially became a junior {{researcher}} at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, [...] but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father. The two worked on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project. On 30 December 1943, they made {{the first of a}} number of visits to the United States, where his father was a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Due to his father's fame, they were given false names; Bohr became James Baker, and his father, Nicholas Baker. In 1945, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator. They reported that it would work. That they had reached this conclusion put Enrico Fermi's concerns about the viability of the design to rest. The initiators performed <b>flawlessly</b> in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.|$|E
