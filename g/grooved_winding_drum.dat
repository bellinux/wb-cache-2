40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} and mechanism of parallel polygonal line <b>groove</b> multilayer <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> were investigated by an experimental approach. Strain-electricity method {{was used to}} test the stress of the cylinder body and the end plates of the drum. Experimental results show that the distribution of the axial bending stress on cylinder body is symmetric in the radial symmetry section. The largest axial bending stress appears in the symmetry plane; however the minimum stress is in the sections close to the end plates on both sides. The axial bending stress of the cylinder body is found to grow with the number of layers wrapped around the drum increasing, while the increment of the stress decreases. When the layer number of the wire rope increases from 4 to 5, the increment of the stress is less than 3 [MPa]. Intorduction With the fast development of the marine engineering, cross-river and cross-ocean bridge construction, port transportation and construction of hydropower stations, the demand of high-lifting hoisting machinery is increasing. In order {{to solve the problem of}} high-lifting, the parallel polygonal line <b>groove</b> multilayer <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> is used, which can make wire rope <b>wind</b> around <b>grooves</b> formed by anterior layer wire rope loops, improve contact conditions of wire rope and prolong wire rope’...|$|R

50|$|The first powered winding engines were {{stationary}} steam engines.

40|$|A winding {{simulation}} model predicting the internal stress state of a wound roll {{would provide an}} indispensable tool for the optimal selection of the winding parameters and, above all, a fast way to design new winding concepts - such as <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> covers and <b>winding</b> geometry. Hence, the nip-induced stresses and nip-induced tension are of the outmost interest to the manufacturer of the winding apparatus. In this thesis, a rigorous contact mechanical model for the winding nip is presented. Under the assumptions of the linear elastic web and paper roll material and compliant <b>winding</b> <b>drum,</b> the indentation, stick and slip equations are derived. The wound-on-condition, a mathematical statement for the initially free sheet becoming finally {{a part of the}} roll, is presented. A variant of the Panagiotopoulos Process is introduced as a solution procedure and numerical results are presented. An invariant condition is derived and, hence, the number of independent winding parameters is reduced from three to two. In the numerical part of the thesis, the basic mechanism of the nip-induced tension is presented and the following items are studied: the influence of the winding force, the layer-to-layer friction coefficient, the wound roll and <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> radius, drum cover compliancy and the elastic constants of paper on the nip-induced tension. The calculated results obtained are shown to comply well with the experiments and literature. reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Burrell's {{experimented with}} a system whereupon the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> was mounted {{vertically}} on the boiler, this had the advantage that external stresses placed on the boiler were much reduced over the standard means of mounting the drum on the underside an engines boiler. This system was first patented by two agricultural engineers from nearby Fakenham, Percival Everitt and William John Adams. By arrangement Burrells built ploughing engines incorporating the Everitt and Adams <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> arrangement and engines were supplied either as a pair with left and right drums or singly with a double drum for use with supplied roundabout tackle. In 1881 Everitt and Adams transferred commercial rights for the system to Burrells for royalties of £5 per engine sold, this type of engine then became known as Universal Type Ploughing Engines. This pattern of side drum mounting was never widely adopted and {{the limited number of}} engines produced most were sold overseas.|$|R

50|$|They {{also built}} {{ploughing}} engines.

The two drums were too large to fit in the usual position beneath the boiler and so were moved to a horizontal axle behind the engine's scuttle, {{with a pair of}} sheaves beneath the boiler to guide the cables.|$|R
