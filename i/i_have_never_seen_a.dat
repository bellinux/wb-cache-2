5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
25|$|I {{must say}} that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Grantland Rice chose him as {{the center}} for his All-Time All-American team. [...] At the time, Rice said: [...] "Schulz was 6feet 4 and he weighed 245pounds. [...] He was {{as fast as a}} good halfback. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> center who was his equal at backing up a line and then {{protecting}} both flanks. [...] He was a terrific tackler".|$|E
60|$|I {{can well}} {{remember}} {{the explosion of}} human joy which marked the sudden starting of that train; all the factory girls who could not find seats (and {{they must have been}} the majority) relieving their feelings by jumping up and down. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> any rationalistic idealists do this. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> twenty modern philosophers crowd into one third-class carriage for the mere pleasure of being together. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> twenty Mr. McCabes all in one carriage and all jumping up and down.|$|R

500|$|... "I {{consider}} the 1917 Tech team the best football I have ever coached", Heisman said. [...] "It's {{the best team}} I have seen in my long career as a coach. I was lucky in having under me a team whose members possessed much natural ability and who played the game intelligently. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> team that, as a whole, was so fast in the composite." [...] For many years, it was considered [...] "the greatest football team the South had ever produced". According to a contemporary New York Sun account, [...] "Georgia Tech looms up {{as one of the}} truly great teams of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1360s, Louis {{suffered}} from a skin disease with symptoms similar to leprosy. Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplation. After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: [...] "I call God as my witness that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> monarch more majestic and more [...] or one who desires peace and calm as much as he." [...] He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states. Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1369. At their next meeting in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, Albert I of Bavaria, and Rupert I of the Palatinate joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs. However, Emperor Charles IV persuaded the two Wittelsbachs (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.|$|E
5000|$|... "The defeat which {{sticks in}} the memory is that 0-44 {{thrashing}} from the South Africans at Murrayfield on 24 November 1951. They were just awesome. It was like sevens played by fifteen men. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything quite like them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a prop forward run as fast as Chris Koch, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> as huge a man as Okey Geffin kick goals...|$|R

500|$|He reached 40 in as {{many minutes}} as Australia's total reached 50. Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney {{contributing}} 83 of those runs. Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131. By lunch, he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1/235, when he hit Macaulay to Patsy Hendren and was dismissed, having amassed 151 in 170 minutes. Former English captain Sir Pelham Warner said [...] "I say without hesitation that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> greater innings... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely". [...] Macartney's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494. He then took 2/51, removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to follow on; however, the Australians could not dismiss the hosts {{for a second time}} and the match ended in a draw.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{had voted}} {{the day before}} in favor of {{approval}} for the Clinton administration's action, saying [...] "Atrocities are the signature of the Serbian Army. They've been carrying out atrocities since 1992. We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic has in mind for Kosovo to continue. We are at a critical hour." [...] He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter, and within days was urging {{that the use of}} ground troops not be ruled out. [...] McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict, and his [...] "We are in it, now we must win it" [...] stance drew much attention. [...] On March 31, three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia; the next day, McCain canceled his planned roadshow, stating [...] "this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign." [...] He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that, [...] "In thirty-five years in Washington, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I've seen this one dominated by John McCain." ...|$|E

I sat there and wept as if I were alone in the presence of God.

2500|$|Evans {{is a grand}} keeper.

Evans is now the world best. That's the way things go and the way we Australians are supposed to like it. Evans reminds me always of a fox terrier. He simply cannot stand still whilst on the cricket field. He moves with short, quick steps, dives, literally dives, at the ball when it is returned badly out of his reach... – Bill O'Reilly ...|$|E
