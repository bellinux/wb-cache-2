40|$|This paper {{detailing}} {{the problem of}} speed fluctuation of IDI engine Rpm i. e. hunting and dipping. It is due to E-RPM adjustment assembly for mechanical centrifugal <b>flyweight</b> <b>governor</b> system. E-RPM adjustment assembly works mainly for high speed adjustment ampidle speed adjustment. In mechanical centrifugal <b>flyweight</b> <b>governor</b> system of IDI engine issue at idle rpm hunting and dipping issue was reported in field. New designs of plunger type stopper cover with compressed coil spring are proposed for E-RPM adjustment assembly for mechanical centrifugal fly-weight governor system. 3 D-Modeling of new design is done on Seimens NX. Kinematic simulation {{was done with the}} help of Altairs Motion-View amp Motion-Solver. Based on the results from MBD the prototype is made and tested in engine. As per the test results from engine testing with new design there is no hunting and dipping problem is reported at idle rpm...|$|E
5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds â€” the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a <b>flyweight</b> centrifugal <b>governor</b> driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|R
