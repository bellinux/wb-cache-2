500|$|Jamie King {{was chosen}} as tour {{director}}. Tim Miller and Kevin Antunes served as director of production and musical director, respectively. Mark Foffano {{was chosen as}} the lightning director. Spears described the tour as [...] "like a Broadway show". The setlist included material from her first studio album ...Baby One More Time (1999) as well as seven songs from Oops!... I Did It Again. Spears explained, [...] "I've been singing the same material for so long now. It'll be nice to change it up a little bit." [...] She also talked about her expectations for the tour, saying, [...] "I can't wait. I'll have a world tour. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> dancers, a bigger stage, more pyro... just a lot bigger". The proscenium stage was much more elaborate than the stage of her previous tour and included video screens, movable platforms and different props. It cost $2.2 million to build. The tone of the show variated from the beginning: for the performance of [...] "Born to Make You Happy", Spears sang in a set resembling a children's bedroom, complete with large toys and a pillow fight routine. On the contrary, she unveiled a more sophisticated image for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", and followed it with raunchy performances for [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again".|$|E
2500|$|Savage's music debut {{was on the}} WWF-produced [...] in 1993, {{where he}} sang on the song [...] "Speaking From The Heart", one of many songs sung by then-WWF wrestlers on the CD. Ten years later, on October 7, 2003, Savage {{released}} a rap album titled Be a Man. It includes a tribute to [...] "Mr. Perfect" [...] Curt Hennig {{as well as a}} diss track aimed at Hulk Hogan. Savage promoted Be A Man with a concert tour featuring Brian Adams as his bodyguard and Ron Harris as touring manager. During this time, the development of a second album was already in progress with Savage exclaiming, [...] "We are absolutely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> records." [...] However, no further albums were released.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you’re talking about...You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of}} my 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E

6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was a changed man. He was {{converted}} to serenity. He was going to cease worrying about business.

6000|$|... 'I {{know of no}} so {{responsible}} {{position as}} that of the public journalist. The editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of printing. Indeed, the position which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now. But the clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world, and to throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls the Next Life. As if next did not mean nearest, and as if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all around him at the caucus, the ratification meeting, and the polls! Who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity, as for some future era of which the present forms no integral part? The furrow which Time is even now turning runs through the Everlasting, and in that must he plant, or nowhere. Yet he would fain believe and teach that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> of eternity than we have now. This going of his is like that of the auctioneer, on which gone follows before we have made up our minds to bid,--in which manner, not three months back, I lost an excellent copy of Chappelow on Job. So it has come to pass that the preacher, instead of being a living force, has faded into an emblematic figure at christenings, weddings, and funerals. Or, if he exercise any other function, it is as keeper and feeder of certain theologic dogmas, which, when occasion offers, he unkennels with a staboy! [...] "to bark and bite as 'tis their nature to," [...] whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen.|$|E
60|$|If I have {{interpreted}} you aright, and I {{hope you will}} tell me whether I have done so or not, this is all to me exceedingly curious; such are {{the differences in the}} opinions of men formed from their different points of view. Now I will give you mine. To give effect to the pledge of honour, by which I became bound in 1853, I made a desperate effort in 1857, with all the zeal of which I was capable, and with all the passion to which I am liable. It was my opinion that the course then taken would be decisive as to the operations in 1860, for the income-tax never can be got rid of except by prospective finance, reaching over several years, and liable to impediment and disturbance accordingly. I therefore protested against the whole scale of expenditure then proposed; as well as against particular kinds of expenditure to which I might refer. I likewise protested against the provision for that expenditure which the government of the day proposed. First, because the expenditure itself was excessive, in my view. Secondly, because in the mode of that provision I thought the remission of income-tax was large out of all proportion to the remission on indirect taxes; and this disproportion I regarded as highly dangerous. I determined to let no political prejudice stand in my way, and to test {{to the best of my}} very feeble power the opinion of parliament with respect to tea and sugar. I stated that if the opinion of parliament were against me I should not factiously prolong the contest but should withdraw from it. Not only was the opinion of parliament against me, but it so happened that the opinion of the country was immediately afterwards taken by a dissolution on that and on other kindred questions. The country affirmed the policy of Lord Palmerston, and the policy of a materially increased expenditure, by an overwhelming majority. I had misjudged public opinion; they had read it aright. After the dissolution of 1857, Sir George Lewis, who had previously raised the tea and sugar duties for one year, proposed to raise them for two more. I immediately followed in debate, and thanked him warmly for doing it. All this of course I can prove. I said, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> expenditure, we must therefore have more taxation.|$|E

5000|$|In 2017, Davis {{advanced}} {{a proposed}} annual municipal budget of $35,164,835 in revenues and $35,539,545 in expenses. The city will use its reserves {{to fill the}} $374,710 gap. “The reality is, we are either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> raise <b>more</b> revenue or cut services. I know the general public thinks we don’t spend our money wisely, but we <b>have</b> made cuts <b>to</b> the budget," [...] Davis said.
