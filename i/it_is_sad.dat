It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life". Fraser also wrote: [...] "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since".|$|E

2500|$|The film however, was {{not without}} its detractors. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert bluntly noted that the motion picture [...] "does not have {{conventional}} rewards or payoffs, does not simplify a complex situation, doesn't punch up the action or the romance simply to entertain. But <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>sad</b> to say, not a very entertaining movie; it's a long slog unless you're fascinated by the undercurrents." [...] In a primarily negative review, Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the film [...] "an oddly unengaging one, {{not because of any}} weak performances (even crooning poetess Jewel acquits herself pleasantly in her film debut), but because the waxy yellow buildup of earnest tastefulness (the curse of the Burns school of history) seals off every character from our access." [...] Describing a favorable opinion, Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle professed the film as exhibiting [...] "unostentatious originality, psychological insight, and stark beauty". While following up, he stressed [...] "There's an odd blend of stylization and extreme realism to this film. The dialogue is stilted, full of archaic $20-words and dime-novel flamboyance — all the more jarring when delivered by these teenaged bumpkin characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2009, West {{took his}} first five-wicket haul in one-day matches during the ICC World Cup Qualifier. In a match against the Oman {{national}} cricket team on 2 April, West took 5/26 in Ireland's 116-run victory, beating his previous best bowling figures in one-day matches of 2/35. Ireland won the tournament and West finished with 14wickets {{at an average of}} 22.92 from 10matches and was Ireland's second highest wicket-taker in the tournament. His haul of 7/88 in the first innings of the 2009 Intercontinental Cup clash against Scotland at Mannonfield in Aberdeen, is a record for Ireland in the competition and the best first-class return since Garfield Harrison's 9/113 against the same opposition in Edinburgh in 1990. West was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all), although he did not make the 4-man short-list. For the summer of 2010, West was unable to play due to injury, and in his absence George Dockrell emerged as Ireland's premier spinner. West announced his retirement from international cricket in April 2011. His decision was caused by a serious injury to his left should; it was believed that he risked damaging it. Reflecting on his time playing for Ireland, West said [...] "Being part of the Ireland team has been the highlight and most enjoyable time of my cricket career.
