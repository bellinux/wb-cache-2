Detailed {{review of the literature}} on ICGA was performed. Retrospective review of medical records of patients with posterior uveitis and dual fundus and ICGA was done after institutional board approval. Eighteen patients (26 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> serpiginous choroiditis out of which 12 patients had active choroiditis and six patients had healed choroiditis, six patients (12 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> ampiginous choroiditis, six patients (12 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> acute multifocal posterior placoid pigment epitheliopathy, eight patients (10 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> multifocal choroiditis, four patients (eight <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, four patients (eight <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> presumed tuberculous choroiditis, two patients (four <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> multiple evanescent white dot syndrome and two patients (four <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> Vogt Koyanagi Harada (VKH) syndrome. The most characteristic feature noted on ICGA was the presence of different patterns of hypofluorescent dark spots, which were present at different stages of the angiogram. ICGA provides the clinician with a powerful adjunctive tool in choroidal inflammatory disorders. It is not meant to replace already proven modalities such as the fluorescein angiography, but it can provide additional information that is useful in establishing a more definitive diagnosis in inflammatory chorioretinal diseases associated with multiple spots. It still needs to be determined if ICGA can prove to be a follow up parameter to evaluate disease progression...|$|R

Procedures to reshape the cornea to correct refractive errors have been a longstanding and fast-evolving area of interest for centuries. As recent advances in excimer laser technology allow keratorefractive treatments to deliver precise treatments with fewer associated risks and complications, the popularity of modern refractive procedures continues to grow at unprecedented rates. For this reason, it is imperative to continue correlating patient characteristics to outcomes so that refractive surgeons can more accurately foresee the results of the selected procedure. This study examined the outcomes of refractive surgeries at a full-scope ophthalmology clinic from January 2011 to November 2011. The main objectives of th is study were to determine the differences between the outcomes of LASIK vs. LASEK, Custom vs. Traditional treatment plans, myopic vs. hyperopic patients and MMC exposure vs. no MMC exposure (LASEK only). More importantly, the data was scrutinized {{to determine whether or not}} any of these treatments and/or patient characteristics correlated with poor visual outcomes or the need for an enhancement. Of the 590 myopic eyes treated with Custom LASIK, 90. 85 % (n= 536 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 96. 10 % (n= 567 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> UDVA of 20 / 25 or better and 99. 32 % (n= 586 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 170 myopic eyes treated with Custom LASEK, 70. 59 % (n= 120 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> a UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 82. 94 % (n= 141 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> a UDVA of 20 / 25 or better and 96. 47 % (n= 164 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> a UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 45 hyperopic eyes that were treated with Traditional LASIK, 44. 44 % (n= 20 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> postoperative UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 62. 22 % (n= 28 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> postoperative UDVA of 20 / 25 or better and 82. 22 % (n= 37 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> postoperative UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 536 eyes receiving LASIK, 91. 42 % (n= 490 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 96. 46 % (n= 517 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 25 or better and 99. 44 % (n= 533 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 146 low or moderately myopic eyes receiving Custom LASEK, 74. 65 % (n= 106 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 86. 62 % (n= 123 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 25 or better and 96. 48 % (n= 137 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 54 highly myopic eyes treated with Custom LASIK, 85. 19 % (n= 46 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 92. 59 % (n= 50 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 25 or better, and 98. 15 % (n= 53 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. Of the 28 highly myopic eyes treated with Custom LASEK, 53. 57 % (n= 15 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 20 or better, 64. 29 % (n= 18 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 25 or better, and 96. 43 % (n= 27 <b>eyes)</b> <b>had</b> an UDVA of 20 / 40 or better. An analysis of these data yields significantly greater percentages of myopic (low, moderate and high) eyes achieving 20 / 20 or better after treatment by Custom LASIK versus Custom LASEK. The data suggested no correlations between poor visual outcomes and/or the need for an enhancement treatment and intraoperative complications, magnitude of ametropia, pupil size, age, treatment type, and treatment plan. All of the LASEK patients who underwent an enhancement treatment were exposed to MMC during their original procedure. Hyperopic patients displayed significantly reduced visual outcomes than comparable myopic treatments. Future studies should investigate similar preoperative characteristics and attempt to correlate them to results to improve predictability and, thus, visual outcomes...|$|R

50|$|An <b>eye</b> that <b>has</b> {{too much}} or too little {{refractive}} power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error.

5|$|The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied {{species with}} a short, thick, and blunt snout. The {{nostrils}} are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of skin {{that do not}} reach the mouth. The horizontally oval <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base that rises to a sharp, upright central cusp; rarely, a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above.

Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the results and}} complications of phacoemulsification surgery due to various factors in patients with cataract formation after intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA). Materials and Methods: Forty-five eyes of 32 patients with cataract formation that had developed after one or multiple IVTA injections {{were included in the}} study. Among these patients, 28 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> diabetic macular edema, 7 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> branch retinal vein occlusion, 2 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> central retinal vein occlusion, 4 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> choroidal neovascular membrane due to age-related macular degeneration, 2 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> uveitic cystoid macular edema and 2 <b>eyes</b> <b>had</b> posterior uveitis. The mean age of the patients was 52. 4 ± 11. 0 years, and all patients underwent standard phacoemulsification surgery with foldable intraocular lens implantation. Results: Minimal hemorrhage developed during surgery in 2 patients with diabetic retinopathy. After anterior chamber lavage, there was no hemorrhage after surgery and during the following days. Postoperatively, transient intraocular pressure elevation treated with topical antiglaucomatous medication was observed in 5 eyes. Seven eyes required Nd:YAG laser therapy due to posterior capsule opasification after a mean follow-up time of 8. 5 months. Conclusion: There were no additional complications secondary to IVTA injection during or after phacoemulsification surgery in patients with cataract formation following IVTA injection...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed <b>eyes</b> <b>have</b> reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
