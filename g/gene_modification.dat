25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} tears {{in the fabric of}} space-time was {{influenced}} by a similar story decision in BioShock. With Rapture set in the 1960, the Irrational team had looked to the scientific progress of James D. Watson and Francis Crick towards understanding DNA in 1953, and built the idea of ADAM and <b>gene</b> <b>modification.</b> For Infinite, the same concept was used with the development of quantum theory by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Werner Heisenberg that would later bore out in the Many Worlds Theory. Incorporating the use of tears was a challenge from the story standpoint but one that Levine enjoyed, noting that this leads to the impression of Booker being an unreliable narrator for the events of the game. One of the game demonstrations showed Elizabeth accidentally opening a tear into a 1980s setting after trying to revive a fallen horse. This setting was in contrast to their initial idea, a woodland glade, which Levine felt wasn't [...] "striking or different enough" [...] than the rest of Columbia. Instead, they borrowed assets from a previous project that, according to lead artist Shawn Robertson, Irrational was [...] "literally about to throw away", finding the contrast and abrupt differences from the Columbia setting helped to emphasize the use of tears in the game. In regards to the ending, Levine has stated that the ending of Infinite is [...] "like nothing you've experienced in a video game before"; the story purposely avoids a problem that arose from the original BioShock in which, after the death of Andrew Ryan before the last third of the game, [...] "the story loses some of its steam".|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} study {{involves the}} use of genetically engineered CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Experimental long-term in vivo HIV gene therapy have had huge issues due to both transduction ending in multiple copies of heterologous DNA in target cells as well as low efficacy of cell transduction at the time of transplantation. This study demonstrated the efficacy of a transplantation approach that ultimately allows for an enriched population of HSPCs expressing a single copy of a CCR5 miRNA. Since positive selection of modified cells is likely to be insufficient below the threshold they found of at least 70% of the HIV target cells resulting in <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> from efficient maintenance of CD34+ T cell and a low viral titer, the findings show evidence that clinical protocols of HIV gene therapy require a selective enrichment of genetically targeted cells.|$|E
50|$|Rat {{models have}} been used to advance many areas of medical research, {{including}} cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders (studies of behavioral intervention and addiction), neural regeneration, diabetes, transplantation, autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis), cancer, and wound & bone healing. While the completion of the rat genome sequence provides very key information, how these diseases relate to gene function requires an efficient method to create knockout rat models in which specific genomic sequences are manipulated.Most techniques for genetic manipulation, including random mutagenesis with a gene trap (retroviral-based and non-retroviral-based), gene knock-outs/knock-ins, and conditional mutations, depend upon the culture and manipulation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Rat ES cells were only recently isolated and no demonstration of <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> in them has been reported.

30|$|The recent {{development}} of engineered nucleases has allowed more precisely targeted gene engineering, namely genome editing. Four types of engineered nuclease systems {{are currently in}} use: EMNs, ZFNs, TALENs, and the CRISPR/Cas 9 system; all these systems rely on the induction of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the target genome DNA [30, 31]. Creating site-directed DSBs in genomic DNA results in <b>gene</b> <b>modifications</b> through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) {{in the case of}} site-directed mutagenesis or homologous recombination repair (HR) in HR-mediated gene targeting [32].|$|R
50|$|Modifying genomes {{using only}} {{homologous}} recombination remained {{a long and}} random process until additional developments were made that could increase the rate of homologous recombination in somatic cell types. These developments include two mechanistically distinct methods of triggering the cells inherent DNA repair mechanisms which are required to insert a foreign gene sequence into a live cell. The first such methods use site-directed endonucleases (restriction enzymes), such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), meganucleases and transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs). Site directed endonucleases achieve <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> through causing double stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks which triggers the cells natural DNA repair mechanism, predominantly non homologous end joining (NHEJ) {{as well as a}} low frequency of homologous recombination (HR). The second method is recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) mediated genome engineering which induces high frequencies of homologous recombination alone, thus forgoing the need to perform dsDNA breaks.|$|E
50|$|As {{stated in}} Environment, Alternaria citri mainly infects {{stressed}} and overripe fruit. One management practice therefore, {{is to prevent}} stress of the fruit. By keeping the fruit and plant healthy the navel {{is less likely to}} split and become infected.1 One way to stop stress is to supply adequate amounts of plant macronutrients. To prevent over ripened fruit from getting infected, harvesting at optimum maturity is advised by clipping the fruit and not snapping it2. Snapping refers to the act of pulling the fruit and damaging the stalk end of the fruit. The exposed tissue of healthy fruits increased the chances of infection from diseased fruits by having a wound for the pathogen to enter. Because fungicides have proved to be unhelpful in stopping the infection of citrus fruits, the use of resistant plants have proven to be the most advantageous form of management. Resistant plants have been produced by breeding hybrid cultivars from existing resistant cultivars, irradiation, or <b>gene</b> <b>modification.</b>|$|E

50|$|Zinc-finger nickases (ZFNickases) {{are created}} by inactivating the {{catalytic}} activity of one ZFN monomer in the ZFN dimer required for double-strand cleavage. ZFNickases demonstrate strand-specific nicking activity in vitro and thus provide for highly specific single-strand breaks in DNA. These SSBs undergo the same cellular mechanisms for DNA that ZFNs exploit, but they show a significantly reduced frequency of mutagenic NHEJ repairs at their target nicking site. This reduction provides a bias for HR-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>modifications.</b> ZFNickases can induce targeted HR in cultured human and livestock cells, although at lower levels than corresponding ZFNs from which they were derived because nicks can be repaired without genetic alteration. A major limitation of ZFN-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>modifications</b> is the competition between NHEJ and HR repair pathways. Regardless {{of the presence of}} a DNA donor construct, both repair mechanisms can be activated following DSBs induced by ZFNs. Thus, ZFNickases is the first plausible attempt at engineering a method to favor the HR method of DNA repair as opposed to the error-prone NHEJ repair. By reducing NHEJ repairs, ZFNickases can thereby reduce the spectrum of unwanted off-target alterations. The ease by which ZFNickases can be derive from ZFNs provides a great platform for further studies regarding the optimization of ZFNickases and possibly increasing their levels of targeted HR while still maintain their reduced NHEJ frequency.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, mice {{have been}} the most common choice for {{researchers}} as a host of a disease model. CRISPR can help bridge the gap between this model and human clinical trials by creating transgenic disease models in larger animals such as pigs, dogs, and non-human primates. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the programmed Cas9 protein and the sgRNA can be directly introduced into fertilized zygotes to achieve the desired <b>gene</b> <b>modifications</b> when creating transgenic models in rodents. This allows bypassing of the usual cell targeting stage in generating transgenic lines, and as a result, it reduces generation time by 90%.|$|R

50|$|An example {{involving}} the direct observation of <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> due to selection pressures is {{the resistance to}} PCBs in codfish. After General Electric dumped polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Hudson River from 1947 through 1976, tomcods (Microgadus tomcod) living in the river {{were found to have}} evolved an increased resistance to the compound's toxic effects. The tolerance to the toxins is due to a change in the coding section of specific gene. Genetic samples were taken from the cods from 8 different rivers in the New England region: the St. Lawrence River, Miramichi River, Margaree River, Squamscott River, Niantic River, the Shinnecock Basic, the Hudson River, and the Hackensack River. Genetic analysis found that in the population of tomcods in the four southernmost rivers, the gene AHR2 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2) was present as an allele with a difference of two amino acid deletions. This deletion conferred a resistance to PCB in the fish species and was found in 99% of Hudson River tomcods, 92% in the Hackensack River, 6% in the Niantic River, and 5% in Shinnecock Bay. This pattern along the sampled bodies of waters infers a direct correlation of selective pressures leading to the evolution of PCB resistance in Atlantic tomcod fish.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{inefficiency}} of <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> by {{homologous recombination}} {{can be overcome}} {{by the introduction of}} a double-strand break (DSB) in the target. Engineering the endonucleases needed, however, remains a challenging task that limits widespread application of nuclease-driven <b>gene</b> <b>modification.</b> We report here that conjugates of orthophenanthroline (OP), a DNA cleaving molecule, and triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), known to bind specific DNA sequences, are synthetic nucleases efficient at stimulating targeted genome modification.

An OP-TFO with a unique target was highly efficient, and mutations at the target site were found in approximately 10 % of treated cells, including small deletions most likely introduced during DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining. Importantly, we found that when homologous donor DNA was cotransfected, targeted <b>gene</b> <b>modification</b> took place in > 1. 5 % of treated cells.
