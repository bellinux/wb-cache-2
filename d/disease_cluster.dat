Evaluations of statistical power provide important information for the selection of an appropriate statistical method in environmentally-related <b>disease</b> <b>cluster</b> investigations. Published power evaluations have not yet addressed the use of models for focused cluster detection and have not fully investigated the issues of <b>disease</b> <b>cluster</b> scale and shape. As meteorological and other factors can impact the dispersion of environmental toxicants, it follows that environmental exposures and associated diseases can be dispersed in a variety of spatial patterns. This study simulates disease clusters in a variety of shapes and scales around a centrally located single pollution source. We evaluate the power of a range of focused cluster tests and generalized linear models to detect these various cluster shapes and scales for count data. Results In general, the power of hypothesis tests and models to detect focused clusters improved when the test or model included parameters specific to the shape of cluster being examined (i. e. inclusion of a function for direction improved power of models to detect clustering with an angular effect). However, power to detect clusters where the risk peaked and then declined was limited. Conclusion Findings from this investigation show sizeable changes in power according to the scale and shape of the cluster and the test or model applied. These findings demonstrate the importance of selecting a test or model with functions appropriate to detect the spatial pattern of the <b>disease</b> <b>cluster.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Ability {{to detect}} {{potential}} space-time clusters in spatio-temporal data on disease occurrences {{is necessary for}} conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention policies. Most existing techniques use geometrically shaped (circular, elliptical or square) scanning windows to discover <b>disease</b> <b>clusters.</b> In certain situations, where the disease occurrences tend to cluster in very irregularly shaped areas, these algorithms are not feasible in practise {{for the detection of}} space-time clusters. To address this problem, a new algorithm is proposed, which uses a co-clustering strategy to detect prospective and retrospective space-time <b>disease</b> <b>clusters</b> with no restriction on shape and size. The proposed method detects space-time <b>disease</b> <b>clusters</b> by tracking the changes in space–time occurrence structure instead of an in-depth search over space.

In this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to test the significance of <b>disease</b> <b>clustering</b> among subjects whose locations are from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive their asymptotic distributions and compare them with other distance-based <b>disease</b> <b>clustering</b> tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} size of these tests to the underlying background pattern (e. g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of clustering and number of clusters, or differences in relative abundances of the classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundance has the highest impact on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power performance of the tests under these alternatives. We illustrate the methods on two real-life examples from epidemiology. Comment: 31 pages, 13 figures, 3 table...|$|R

This index has received considerable attention in the literature including the suggestion that it be used to detect the space-time <b>clustering</b> of <b>diseases</b> and the suggestion to use similar test statistics to detect <b>disease</b> <b>clustering</b> in space and/or time while accounting for a changing population size over the study period. This paper concerns the related question of measuring {{the severity of the}} <b>disease</b> <b>clustering</b> once it has been determined that cases are not randomly distributed over space and/or time. A family of alternatives to randomness is proposed in which space and/or time versions of Tango's index are sufficient statistics for the parameters measuring the severity of the clustering. For the special case of temporal clustering, an unbiased estimator of the clustering parameter and its sampling variance is derived, and a particularly simple interpretation of this estimator is suggested. These latter results are based on some asymptotic approximations due to Tango [Biometrics 46 : 351 (1990) ]. An application to the trisomy data given by Wallenstein [Am. J.
