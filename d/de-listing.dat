500|$|Following the election, Stelmach's new Minister of Health, Ron Liepert, {{released}} the government's new health plan. In it, Liepert refused {{to characterize the}} problems in the health care system as being the result of doctor shortages, and instead promised structural reforms. He indicated that these may include consolidating health authorities, closing rural hospitals, and <b>de-listing</b> some health services from coverage under the province's public health insurance scheme. In May, the government took the first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining the province's nine health authorities into one health [...] "superboard".|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, 2002, {{seven months}} after Hussein was {{originally}} listed as a terrorist, the Canadian government announced {{that it had been}} shown [...] "no evidence" [...] suggesting that he was linked to terrorism, and that charges would therefore be dropped.

2500|$|On Thursday 5 June 2008 the Legislative Council {{supported}} Parliament's first <b>de-listing</b> of {{an order}} by the Heritage Council {{so that the}} house could be demolished {{on the basis that}} the Government was potentially exposed to a $20 million lawsuit under clause 76 of the 1990 State Heritage Act. The clause, which had never previously been used, allows owners of heritage-listed properties to ask the Government to buy their property if its heritage listing makes it [...] "incapable of reasonably beneficial use, and that the carrying out of any reasonable development could not render the land capable of reasonably beneficial use". The property was subsequently removed from the State Register of Heritage Places on 22 August 2008. Section 55 of the Act precludes consideration for re-entry onto the Register for a period of five years from the date of its removal, except with leave of the Supreme Court.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} election, however, the former provincial auditor {{undertook}} {{a study that}} revealed that the Harris-Eves Tories had hidden a deficit of at least $5.6 billion. Minister of Finance Greg Sorbara released a budget introducing tax increases on commodities and businesses, {{the introduction of a}} new income tax called the [...] "Ontario Health Premium" [...] for all but low-income Ontarians, the <b>de-listing</b> of health-care services from Ontario Health Insurance Plan. The budget, along with the failure to prevent construction on the environmentally sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine after his election made the McGuinty government unpopular during its first few months. During his second month in office, McGuinty had an approval rating of only 8%, a record low. [...] Somewhat surprisingly, even though the new Liberal government were viewed to have broken some of their promises, on December 14, 2003, 60% of Ontarians in an Ipsos-Reid Poll (on behalf of Globe and Mail/CFTO/CFRB) said they were better off governed by the Liberals now than the Conservatives under Ernie Eves.|$|E
