Usually {{this is a}} standard and safe practice, since the return conductor is held at <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> anyway. However, because of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the return conductor is not being held, as expected, at <b>ground</b> <b>potential,</b> or where current leakage occurs between the return and earth conductors.

50|$|Ground loops - When {{grounding}} a circuit, it {{is important}} to avoid ground loops. Ground loops occur when there is a voltage drop between the two <b>ground</b> <b>potentials.</b> Since <b>ground</b> is thought of as 0 V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a ground bus. If this is the case, {{it would not be a}} true ground. A good way to fix this is to bring all the ground wires to the same <b>potential</b> in a <b>ground</b> bus.|$|R

[...] RCDs used on single-phase AC supplies (two current paths), such as domestic power, are usually one- or two-pole designs, also known as single- and double-pole. A single-pole RCD interrupts only the energized conductor, while a double-pole RCD interrupts both the energized and return conductors. (In a single-pole RCD, the return conductor is usually anticipated to be at <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> at all times and therefore safe on its own, however see limitations below).|$|E

2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and resettable devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared. Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at ground (earth) potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the return wire [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected <b>ground</b> <b>potential</b> for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} coaxial cable have a {{characteristic}} impedance of 75Ω, which would therefore {{be a good}} match for a half-wave dipole, however, without special precautions, coax transmission line easily becomes unbalanced (with one conductor at <b>ground</b> <b>potential)</b> whereas a dipole antenna presents a balanced input (both terminals have an equal but opposite voltage with respect to ground). When an antenna is unbalanced, the unbalanced currents or “common mode” currents will flow backward along the outer conductor and the coax line will radiate, {{in addition to the}} antenna itself,. An important consequence is distortion of the antenna’s designed radiation pattern, and change in the impedance seen by the line. The dipole can be properly fed, and retain its expected characteristics, by using a [...] balun in between the coaxial feedline and the antenna terminals. Connection of coax to a dipole antenna using a balun is described in greater detail below.|$|E
