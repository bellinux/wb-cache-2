Sullivan bonds with his son and discovers from the ledgers that Connor has been embezzling from his father for years, using the names of dead men. As the Sullivans depart, they give the couple much of the stolen money. Sullivan confronts Rooney with the {{information}} while they attend Mass. Rooney already knew about the embezzlement and that Connor was likely to die, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> Sullivan's hand then by the Chicago Outfit once Rooney dies. He still refuses {{to give up his}} son. He encourages Sullivan to leave with his son.|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, <b>if</b> <b>not,</b> <b>by</b> originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

25|$|Asian Americans {{were also}} marginalized {{during much of}} US history. Between 1882 and 1943 the United States {{government}} instituted the Chinese Exclusion Act which prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the nation. During {{the second world war}} roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans, 62% of whom were U.S. citizens, were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps. Hispanic Americans also faced segregation and other types of discrimination; they were regularly subject to second class citizen status, in practice <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> law.|$|E

When the NABBP permitted professionalism for 1869, Harry augmented himself and four incumbents with five new men including brother George, who was highest paid at $1400 for nine months. George remained a cornerstone of Harry's teams for ten seasons.|$|E
25|$|Although {{artists like}} Eugène Delacroix were ardent champions of his effort, the public {{went to the}} show mostly out of curiosity and to deride him. Attendance and sales were disappointing, but Courbet's status as a hero to the French avant-garde became assured. He was admired by the American James McNeill Whistler, and he became an {{inspiration}} to the younger generation of French artists including Édouard Manet and the Impressionist painters. The Artist's Studio was recognized as a masterpiece by Delacroix, Baudelaire, and Champfleury, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the public.|$|E
25|$|She {{initially}} wrote a work on artistic training, Le dessin sans maître (1850), which {{explained the}} Cavé Method, {{which she said}} she had used since 1847. It aimed to exercise visual memory, a basic aptitude necessary for drawing. Delacroix wrote a favourable review in the Revue des deux Mondes of September 1850. A commission examined the method in 1850 and decided in favour of it and Lecoq's method (inspired by the same concept). The Minister of Public Education trialled Cavé's method in normal primary schools in Caen and Douai in 1862 and later the same year in those in Chartres. The results were judged to be satisfactory enough to recommend adopting the method in other normal schools. The assessors' arguments in favour of drawing training did not change the fact that they saw it as a pastime rather than an industrial skill - it is still impossible to say how far these methods were applied, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> their inventors.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} violent episodes {{occurred}} in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks. The rioting in Chicago started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless. Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the {{drive-in}} theater market {{was one of the}} major spurs to the expansion of the independent low-budget film industry. As of January 1, 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, the number had passed 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects—that is, B pictures in both production values and aesthetic spirit <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the older, more precise industrial definition—were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. Over the course of the decade, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station KABC expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: on Saturday nights, The Vampira Show, with Maila Nurmi as the titular MC, screened low-budget horror and suspense movies, including at least one that would become a cult classic—Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour, produced in 1945 for $117,000. Variations on the Vampira format were soon running at stations around the country.|$|E
25|$|The strict {{adherence}} to cadency, or {{the need for}} cadets to difference their arms from {{the chief of the}} family, is due to the permanence of the old families. From an early period the leading families of England were extinguished in the male line. Some continue to exist in the male line, but are comparatively obscure, having sprung from untitled cadets of the ancient families. On the other hand, the Scoto-Norman barons were remarkable for their numerous progeny. Sub-infeudation, which had been prohibited in England since the time of the Plantagenet kings, was largely practiced in Scotland. Whole districts of Scotland have their predominant names, which are generally those of the old feudal families. Surnames were {{for a long time after}} their introduction, used only by the gentry; and when they began to be assumed by the lower orders, the clansman almost invariably took the name of his chief, considering himself a member of his family, at least by adoption, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> blood. In England new men emerged, and founded new families; it was easier to adopt new arms rather than trace a connection with those who had died. Hence it came to pass that while in England the multitude of entirely distinct coats of arms is enormous, in Scotland the number of original coats is small.|$|E

500|$|On May 26, 1847, Ryerson wrote {{a letter}} for George Vardon, Assistant Superintendent of Indian Affairs, asserting that [...] "the North American Indian cannot be civilized or {{preserved}} {{in a state of}} civilization (including habits of industry and sobriety) except in connection with, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the influence of, not only religious instruction and sentiment but of religious feelings". He expressly recommended that Indigenous students be educated in a separate, denominational, English-only system with a focus on industrial training. This letter was published as an appendix to a larger report entitled Statistics Respecting Indian Schools.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Tomašević {{was buried}} {{on a hill}} near Jajce. Europe was stunned to see the Bosnian state fall almost {{completely}} within weeks of his death. The country's quick submission {{is said to be}} the consequence of a poor cooperation between Stephen and his noblemen, but it is perhaps most accurate to attribute it to the people's low morale and general belief that the conquest was inevitable. [...] Additionally, the religiously diverse Bosnians were aware, much like the neighbouring Serbians, that the country would be overrun by Hungary <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> the Ottomans, and that they would enjoy far less freedom of religion and far higher taxes in that case. Therefore, resistance was not as strong as it could have been. Pope Pius's claim that adherents of the Bosnian Church betrayed the kingdom is groundless.|$|E
