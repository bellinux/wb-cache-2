40|$|Days of {{operations}} in the National Airspace System {{can be described in}} term of traffic demand, runway conditions, equipment outages, and surface and enroute weather conditions. These causes manifest themselves in terms of departure delays, arrival delays, enroute delays and traffic flow management delays, Traffic flow management initiatives such as, ground stops, ground delay programs, miles-in-trail restrictions, rerouting and airborne holding are imposed to balance the air traffic demand with respect to the available capacity, In order to maintain operational efficiency of the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintains delay sad other statistics in the Air Traffic Operations Network (OPSNET) and the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) databases. OPSNET data includes reportable delays of fifteen minutes ox more experienced by Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flights. Numbers of aircraft affected by departure delays, enroute delays, arrival delays and traffic flow delays are recorded in the OPSNET data. ASPM data consist of number of actual departures, number of canceled departures, percentage of on time departures, percentage of on time gate arrivals, taxi-out delays. taxi-in delays, gate delays, arrival delays and block delays. Surface conditions at the major U. S. airports are classified in terms of <b>Instrument</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Condition</b> (IMC) and Visual <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Condition</b> (VMC) {{as a function of the}} time of the day in the ASPM data. The main objective of this paper is to use OPSNET and ASPM data to classify the days in the datasets into few distinct groups, where each group is separated from the other groups in terms of a distance metric. The motivations for classifying the days are two-fold, 1) to enable selection of days of traffic with particular operational characteristics for concept evaluation using system-wide simulation systems such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airspace Concepts Evaluation Tool (ACES) and 2) to enable evaluation of a given day with respect to the characteristics of the classified groups. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of major trends seen in the OPSNET and ASPM data. The second part of the paper is devoted to describing features or measures derived from the OPSNET and ASPM data that are suitable for characterizing days, and the classification algorithm used for grouping the days.

AOD was computed at three different spatial resolutions, i. e., 2 km (means 2 km × 2 km area at nadir), 5 km, and 10 km, by using the data from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Multiresolution AOD from MODIS (AODMODIS) was compared with the in situ measurements of AOD by NASA’s AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sunphotometer (AODAERONET) at Bondville, IL, to demonstrate {{the advantages of the}} fine resolution AODMODIS over the 10 -km AODMODIS, especially for air quality prediction. An instrumental regression that corrects AODMODIS for <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> was used for developing a PM predictive model. The 2 -km AODMODIS aggregated within 0. 025 ◦ and 15 -min intervals shows the best association with the in situ measurements of AODAERONET. The 2 -km AODMODIS seems more promising to estimate time and space resolved estimates of ambient PM than the 10 -km AODMODIS, because of better location precision and a significantly greater number of data points across geographic space and time. Utilizing the collocated AODMODIS and PM data in Cleveland, OH, a regression model was developed for predicting PM for all AODMODIS data points. Our analysis suggests that the slope of the 2 -km AODMODIS (<b>instrumented</b> on <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions)</b> is close to unity with the PM monitored on the ground. These results should be interpreted with caution, because the slope of AODMODIS ranges from 0. 52 to 1. 72 in the site-specific models. In the cross validation of the overall model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of PM 10 was smaller (2. 04 μg/m 3 in overall model) than that of PM 2. 5 (2. 5 μg/m 3). The predicted PM in the AODMODIS data (~ 2. 34 million data points) was utilized to develop a systematic grid of daily PM at 5 -km spatial resolution with the aid of spatiotemporal Kriging...|$|R

To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} these strategies, the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on levels of {{air pollution}} needs to be determined. Using the intensive air pollution control strategies implemented during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in 2014 (APEC 2014) and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade (Victory Parade 2015) as examples, we estimated the role of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and pollution control strategies in reducing air pollution levels in Beijing. Atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter [*]≤[*] 2. 5  µm (PM 2. 5) samples were collected and gaseous pollutants (SO 2, NO, NO x, and O 3) were measured online at a site in Peking University (PKU). To determine the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on the levels of air pollution, we first compared the air pollutant concentrations during days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, there were few days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during the Victory Parade. As such, we were unable to estimate the level of emission reduction efforts during this period. Finally, a generalized linear regression model (GLM) based only on meteorological parameters was built to predict air pollutant concentrations, which could explain more than 70  % of the variation in air pollutant concentration levels, after incorporating the nonlinear relationships between certain meteorological parameters and the concentrations of air pollutants. Evaluation of the GLM performance revealed that the GLM, even based only on meteorological parameters, could be satisfactory to estimate the contribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> in reducing air pollution and, hence, the contribution of control strategies in reducing air pollution.
