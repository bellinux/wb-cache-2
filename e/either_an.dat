5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add <b>either</b> <b>an</b> edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack.

5|$|A typical McKinsey {{engagement}} {{can last}} {{between two and}} twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have <b>either</b> <b>an</b> industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{walkthrough}} is a guide aimed towards improving a player's skill {{within a particular}} video game and often designed to assist players in completing <b>either</b> <b>an</b> entire video game or specific elements. Walkthroughs may alternatively be set up as a playthrough, where players record themselves playing through a game and upload or live-stream it to the internet. Walkthroughs may be considered guides on helping to enhance the experience of players, to assist towards unlocking game achievements or simply {{as a means to}} socialise with like-minded individuals as a distraction from everyday life.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without <b>either</b> <b>an</b> unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|Béla II's army invaded Bosnia in 1136, {{which he}} commemorated by {{adopting}} the title King of Rama after a small river. The following year, the King appointed Ladislaus Duke of Bosnia at an {{assembly of the}} prelates and barons in Esztergom. However, Ladislaus never personally ruled the territory and administration was overseen by the Ban, who was <b>either</b> <b>an</b> appointed or an elected official.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean <b>either</b> <b>an</b> intensification or plurality.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as <b>either</b> <b>an</b> early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E

5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries <b>either</b> <b>an</b> X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E

If the conglomerate consists {{of two or more}} different types of rocks, minerals, or combination of both, it is known as <b>either</b> <b>a</b> polymict or polymictic conglomerate. If a polymictic conglomerate contains an assortment of the clasts of metastable and unstable rocks and minerals, it called <b>either</b> <b>a</b> petromict or petromictic conglomerate.|$|R
