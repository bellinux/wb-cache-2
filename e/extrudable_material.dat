40|$|Publication Number: WO/ 2007 / 041791; Publication Date: 19. 04. 2007; International Filing Date: 12. 10. 2006 A die {{and method}} for {{extruding}} an <b>extrudable</b> <b>material</b> {{to form an}} extruded member is described. In one embodiment, the die comprises a barrier member comprising a plurality of feed channels that extend through the barrier member. Furthermore, the die incorporates a passage forming member extending from the barrier member substantially {{in the direction of}} extrusion. The feed channels are arranged with respect to the passage forming member to allow the <b>extrudable</b> <b>material</b> to substantially flow about the passage forming member to form a corresponding passage in the extruded member...|$|E
40|$|Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings' Infinity Initiative {{program is}} the carpet industry's first {{commercial}} operation {{to address the problem}} of solid waste disposal. In this program, Collins & Aikman assists customers with the coordination and return of their carpet for recycling. During 1995, 3. 75 million pounds of <b>extrudable</b> <b>material</b> was diverted from land filling. In the Infinity Initiative program, reclaimed commercial carpet and manufacturing waste are reduced in size by a grinding process. The ground, thermoplastic material is then extruded into other useful products. These products can be recycled again and again, thus creating products with an infinite life cycle. The program was named "Infinity Initiative" because products will essentially have an infinite life cycle. Extensive market research was conducted to ensure that products produced from recycling through the Infinity Initiative program would have real market value. Products currently produced from recycled composite material (ER³) include: car parking stops, industrial block flooring, and highway sound barrier walls. A program is currently in place to use this source of recycled material in Collins & Aikman products - that is to recycle our product back into itself. The company's goal is to offer a product with high recycle content before late 1996. Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings is one of industry's largest suppliers of specialty commercial flooring. Their plants, located in Dalton, Georgia, manufacture modular carpet tile with a conventional, vinyl "hard back" as well as six-foot wide roll goods with a vinyl "cushion" back. Collins & Aikman Powerbond RS products are constructed differently than many "conventional" caipets. Powerbond products, engineered for maximum performance, are composed of a densely constructed, premium nylon 6. 6 face and a vinyl composite backing. A microencapsulated tackifier (RS) system applied to the product during manufacturing eliminates the use of "wet" adhesives during installation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{rheological}} properties of an extrudable cement-based paste are investigated {{by means of}} an original ram extrusion apparatus (capillary rheometer). The experimental results indicate that a careful measurement of the die pressure is necessary to obtain a realistic viscosity vs shear rate curve, as required in extrusion technology. In particular, it is shown that the optimal test configuration is when the pressure measurement is made directly inside the rheometer die. By applying this rheological methodology in steady-state conditions, it has been observed that the <b>extrudable</b> cement-based <b>material</b> here evaluated obeys to a simple power–law equation, in the range of shear rates investigated, which are suitable for an industrial extrusion proces...|$|R
40|$|Heart valve {{disease is}} a {{tremendous}} national and global burden. Prosthetic replacement is essentially the only treatment for a critically damaged or malformed valve, and current aortic valve replacement options for pediatric patients are grimly inadequate. Tissue engineering {{has the potential to}} generate living heart valve replacements capable of growth and integration needed to treat children with valve disease. Over the last 15 years, researchers have developed and implemented novel synthetic polymers as scaffolds for engineered heart valves. Although much progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty incorporating native-like heterogeneity and controlled remodeling into TEHV. The work presented here demonstrates a 3 D bioprinting approach that generates complex 3 D geometry tissue constructs using <b>extrudable</b> <b>materials</b> and encapsulated cells based on native aortic valve tissue heterogeneity. As a fabrication strategy 3 D printing overcomes the limitations associated with classical heart valve tissue engineering assembly of scaffolds. To enable direct cell-hydrogel printing and thereby maximize geometric control within valve constructs, viability experiments were used to establish photoencapsulation fabrication parameters tolerated by cells. Photocrosslinking experiments demonstrate that contrary to numerous 2 D cytotoxicity studies, in a 3 D hydrogel culture environment and fabrication setting, Irgacure 2959 photoinitiator can produce more viable encapsulated cells than VA 086 photoinitiator in a higher stiffness hydrogel. A dynamic conditioning system designed specifically for the culture of 3 D bioprinted valves was 1 st validated using porcine aortic heart valves. Photoencapsulation viability experiments and bioreactor validation studies presented in this work provide a range of fabrication and conditioning parameters, that were utilized for the fabrication and dynamic culture of 3 D bioprinted hydrogel heart valves. Our studies indicate that the bioprinted valves can be produced with high viability encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells for the purposes of a TEHV or with primary aortic valve cells for the purpose of in vitro testing and mechanistic study. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|DE 102007038671 A 1 UPAB: 20090311 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} extruding a {{raw material}} (2) of thermoplastic to a product stream (7) in an extruding device (3). A partial stream (23) is automatically {{separated from the}} product stream and supplied to a molding device. A test body is produced in the molding device from the partial stream by injection molding. An intermediate or end product is produced from the product stream after {{the separation of the}} partial stream. The product stream is separated into two partial streams, and a physical and/or chemical parameter of the product stream is continuously measured. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for producing a test body from extrudable thermoplastic. USE - Method for producing a test body e. g. shouldered test bar and test plate, from extrudable thermoplastic. ADVANTAGE - The method enables production of the test body from the <b>extrudable</b> raw <b>material</b> in a simple and cost-effective manner while facilitating simple design and quality control in the industrial and/or technical scale.
