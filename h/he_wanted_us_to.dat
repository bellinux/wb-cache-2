Wyclef Jean, a member of The Fugees, told MTV of {{his involvement in the}} production, [...] "We did a first remix for Michael, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do another one". The group spoke of their excitement at receiving a phone call from Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich was the co-creator {{and initial}} writer of Marvel's motorcycle-demon Ghost Rider, and later teamed with that character's first artist, Mike Ploog, on Marvel's Monster of Frankenstein – {{the first five}} issues of which (Jan.-Oct. 1973) {{contained}} a relatively faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. As one critic wrote of issue #4: [...] "Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics." [...] Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee [...] "had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. I {{have no idea why}} or where it came from. All he really had was the name and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> create a character based around that. I guess it just popped in his mind. He said [...] "I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Fletch {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 28 critics with the consensus: [...] "Quotably funny -- and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land -- Fletch {{is one of the}} best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is, Chase's performance tends to reduce all the scenes to the same level, at least as far as he is concerned. He projects such an inflexible mask of cool detachment, of ironic running commentary, that we're prevented from identifying with him [...] [...] [...] Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself." [...] Vincent Canby in his review for The New York Times praised Chase's performance, writing, [...] "He manages simultaneously to act the material with a good deal of nonchalance and to float above it, as if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know that he knows that the whole enterprise is somewhat less than transcendental." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "In Fletch, the quick, smartly paced, gags somehow read as signs of vulnerability. Incidentally, they add greatly to the movie's suspense. Every minute you expect the hero's loose lip to be turned into a fat one." [...] In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr wrote, [...] "Chase and Ritchie make a strong, natural combination: the union of their two flip, sarcastic personalities produces a fairly definitive example of the comic style of the 80s, grounded in detachment, underreaction, and cool contempt for rhetorically overblown authority figures." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{have talked}} with the CNO (Chief of Naval Operations) in America. He is very keen for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> get these because he sees us {{slotting}} in with his carrier groups. <b>He</b> really <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have these, but <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have {{the same sort of}} clout as one of their carriers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you}} that nothing but entire rest would cure you. I know it's dreadfully hard, but we'll all help you; I'll read all day long, and lead you, and wait upon you, {{and try to make}} it easier." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{paddling}} up, {{he told us}} that a canoe {{had arrived}} overnight, from Papeetee, with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the pack}} are out," [...] said Leo grimly, [...] "and Rassen {{has brought a}} second mount with him.

5000|$|Inexperienced {{writers are}} often advised to show {{rather than to}} describe. One of the mysteries of Gallico's style is its {{effectiveness}} despite his constant violation of this rule. When <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know that a Peyrot is cynical, he says [...] "Wholly cynical, he had no regard or respect for man, woman, child, or God." [...] When <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know that Mouche is innocent, he tells us of her [...] "innocence and primitive mind." [...] When <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know that Rhayader has a warm heart in his crippled body, he says [...] "His body was warped, but his heart was filled with love for wild and hunted things." [...] Many of Gallico's stories are told as a string of assertions and generalities, illuminated only by touches of the particular and specific.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I like better, though I'd be very sorry {{to lose my}} report. It's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to,</b> and seeing how pleased he'll be," [...] added Jack, rather bashfully, for the boys laughed at him {{sometimes}} for his love of this friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vernon's a good sort {{and more}} fastidious than one thinks; he saw he'd {{be forced to}} venture on rather awkward ground, {{and there was some}} doubt. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> weigh the story and judge if the clew he gave us ought to be followed. This was not Vernon's job, {{although}} I think he was satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Will Morrison in New York, Hannah," [...] {{he said to}} his wife. [...] "He {{was just}} sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> occupy his {{mountain}} place, Hillcrest Lodge, during July and August, and although I told him we couldn't use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not more 'n {{three or}} four days. I'm expectin' word from Bimbel as soon as I reach the Junction, and then I'll know just what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as I thought," [...] {{continued}} Shep. [...] "And {{just what}} I told my father. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go out, you know," [...] and Shep's eyes began to twinkle.|$|R
6000|$|... "And didn't {{you like}} it," [...] broke in Amy, [...] "when {{he said that}} was not what God asked of us? <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be like the wheat, or the vine, or the apple, or the strawberry, some plain in blossom, some fair and lovely to look at, but valued for the fruit they bring forth, not selfishly, just to keep up their own stock, but for the support and joy and blessing of all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> stop from church, {{asked me}} to let off the poor little coon; and when I said we couldn't, because {{we were in the}} choir, wanted to know what we were paid, then why we did it at all; and so it turned out that he thinks churches only meant for women and psalm-singing niggers and Methodists, and has never been inside one in his life, never saw the sense of it, wanted to know why I went.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He ain't got the {{slightest}} sense of our position," [...] said Mrs. Coombes; [...] "that's what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and if I {{have a bit}} of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, or get any little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there's disagreeables. 'Economy' he says; 'struggle for life,' and all that. He lies awake of nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> eat Dorset butter once. If once I was to give in to him--there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{just where}} you are," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Before we do {{anything}} else, we must know what Captain Horn intends to do, and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's from Uncle Randolph. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{come home}} at once. He says -- but read it for yourselves," [...] and the elder Rover handed over the message, which ran as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked my}} father that, and he said most likely by next Monday. <b>He</b> will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give <b>us</b> all some {{instructions}} before we leave. And <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> read this book," [...] and Shep drew a small volume from his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course Don Carlos {{set that}} fire," [...] put in Florence, with spirit. [...] "Al, {{if you live}} out heah a hundred years you'll never learn that Greasers are treacherous. I know Gene Stewart {{suspected}} something underhand. That's why <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> hurry away. That's why he {{put me on the}} black horse of Don Carlos's. He wants that horse for himself, and feared the Don would steal or shoot him. And you, Bill Stillwell, you're as bad as Al. You never distrust anybody till it's too late. You've been singing ever since Stewart ordered the vaqueros off the range. But you sure haven't been thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the most}} {{distressing}} {{thing of all}} {{was that he was}} always making plans, and often they went beyond the 13th! Whenever that happened it made us groan in spirit. All his mind was fixed upon finding some way to conquer our depression and cheer us up; and at last, when he had but three days to live, he fell upon the right idea and was jubilant over it--a boys-and-girls' frolic and dance in the woods, up there where we first met Satan, and this was to occur on the 14th. It was ghastly, for that was his funeral day. We couldn't venture to protest; it would only have brought a [...] "Why?" [...] which we could not answer. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> help him invite his guests, and we did it--one can refuse nothing to a dying friend. But it was dreadful, for really we were inviting them to his funeral.|$|E
6000|$|Until {{we started}} this {{business}} of floating old Chiswick as a money-making proposition I had never realized what a perfectly foul time those Stock Exchange chappies must have when the public isn't biting freely. Nowadays I read that bit they put in the financial reports about [...] "The market opened quietly" [...] with a sympathetic eye, for, by Jove, it certainly opened quietly for us! You'd hardly believe {{how difficult it was}} to interest the public and make them take a flutter on the old boy. By {{the end of the week}} the only name we had on our list was a delicatessen-store keeper down in Bicky's part of the town, and as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take it out in sliced ham instead of cash that didn't help much. There was a gleam of light when the brother of Bicky's pawnbroker offered ten dollars, money down, for an introduction to old Chiswick, but the deal fell through, owing to its turning out that the chap was an anarchist and intended to kick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him. At that, it took me the deuce of a time to persuade Bicky not to grab the cash and let things take their course. He seemed to regard the pawnbroker's brother rather as a sportsman and benefactor of his species than otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|Nugent coached Florida State in {{its first}} {{football}} game against intrastate rival Florida. The match-up required haggling with his University of Florida counterpart, coach Bob Woodruff, about whom Nugent said, [...] "It seems <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> promise everything but lose the game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing at}} a time then. Let us by all means be convivial. Only you must show me how," [...] Mrs. Dallow went on to Nick. [...] "What does he mean, Cousin Agnes? Does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> drain the wine-cup, to flash with repartee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's comin' up yer to-night, bringin' {{a friend}} of his--a patient that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> board and keep for three weeks until he's well agin," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Rivers. [...] "Ye know how the doctor used to rave about the pure air on our hill." ...|$|R
