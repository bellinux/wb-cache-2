Archaeological data appear to be no obstacle against the traditional view of a post-Mycenaean Dorian migration from Northern to Southern Greece. Tradition and Myth are to be credited as reliable sources: the «Return of the Heraclidae» is in fact a true account for how and when the Dorian occupied Southern Greece. The so-called «différences dialectales» in Mycenaean cannot be interpreted as evidence of a proto-Doric speaking population: the «special» Mycenaean is by no means proto-Doric; between Mycenaean (and closely related dialects) and (proto-) Doric there are many early and late differences and <b>divergent</b> <b>developments.</b> It turns out quite difficult to believe that Mycenaean and Proto-Dorian met in the Peloponnesus. Differences should have been eliminated and, instead of two <b>divergent</b> <b>developments,</b> there should be expected a common development and only one.

50|$|North {{argues that}} because of the preexisting {{influence}} that existing organizations have over the existing framework, change that is brought about is often in the interests of these organizations. This produces a phenomenon called path dependence, which states that institutional patterns are persistent and endure over time. These paths are determined at critical junctures, analogous to a fork in the road, whose outcome leads to a narrowing of possible future outcomes. Once a choice is made during a critical juncture, it becomes progressively difficult to return to the initial point where the choice was made. James Mahoney studies path dependence in the context of national regime change in Central America and finds that liberal policy choices of Central American leaders in the 19th century was the critical juncture that led to the divergent levels of development that we see in these countries today. The policy choices that leaders made in the context of liberal reform policy led to a variety of self-reinforcing institutions that created <b>divergent</b> <b>development</b> outcomes for the Central American countries.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{argued that a}} cultural divide exists between the Randstad {{and the rest of}} the country. This distinction is usually made in relation to Dutch politics and media, who according to critics are mostly interested in the affairs of the Randstad. Both branches (government and media) have their center in the Randstad; respectively in The Hague and in Hilversum. The Randstad itself, however, does not represent a unified cultural zone. It is not a 'place' of residence or a carrier of cultural identity. According to the late influential urbanist Niek de Boer, the Randstad simply 'does not exist'. While the cities and landscapes in the Randstad share some commonalities, there are also large differences originating in centuries of <b>divergent</b> <b>development.</b> There are strong local identities within the region, especially in rural environments. In the broadest terms the Randstad is culturally divided between the more politically progressive northern urban centers of Amsterdam, Haarlem and Utrecht, and the more conservative southern urban centers of The Hague, Rotterdam and Dordrecht. However, the university cities of Leiden and Delft, while geographically located in the southern part of the Randstad, also have a more progressive outlook.|$|E
50|$|In {{their paper}} Andrikou and Arnone argue that to truly {{understand}} {{the evolution of}} muscle cells the function of transcriptional regulators must be understood {{in the context of}} other external and internal interactions. Through their analysis, Andrikou and Arnone found that there were conserved orthologues of the gene regulatory network in both invertebrate bilaterians and in cnidarians. They argue that having this common, general regulatory circuit allowed for a high degree of divergence from a single well functioning network. Andrikou and Arnone found that the orthologues of genes found in vertebrates had been changed through different types of structural mutations in the invertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes, and they argue that these structural changes in the genes allowed for a large divergence of muscle function and muscle formation in these species. Andrikou and Arnone were able to recognize not only any difference due to mutation in the genes found in vertebrates and invertebrates but also the integration of species specific genes that could also cause divergence from the original gene regulatory network function. Thus, although a common muscle patterning system has been determined, they argue that this could be due to a more ancestral gene regulatory network being coopted several times across lineages with additional genes and mutations causing very <b>divergent</b> <b>development</b> of muscles. Thus it seems that myogenic patterning framework may be an ancestral trait. However, Andrikou and Arnone explain that the basic muscle patterning structure must also be considered in combination with the cis regulatory elements present at different times during development. In contrast with the high level of gene family apparatuses structure, Andrikou and Arnone found that the cis regulatory elements were not well conserved both in time and place in the network which could show a large degree of divergence in the formation of muscle cells. Through this analysis, it seems that the myogenic GRN is an ancestral GRN with actual changes in myogenic function and structure possibly being linked to later coopts of genes at different times and places.|$|E

Yet the defunding of these revenue streams, and a city’s reliance on specific types of funding, positions each city in {{a more or less}} advantageous position for future prosperity. These results suggest that local development is best understood as the interplay between local infrastructures, various intergovernmental incentives, and the needs of capital. ...|$|E

From our results, two general features of entrepreneurship in the Triple Helix emerge. First of all, private stand-alone enterprises do not mirror entrepreneurs at large. Second, networks of various entrepreneurs are much more common and much more complex than usually anticipated. More specifically, we find that there are rather <b>divergent</b> <b>developments</b> in Dutch energy systems. Whereas in the case of Aardwarmte Den Haag, a number of key players collaborated in order to realize one specific technology, in the LochemEnergie case, we see a project-to-project approach supported by subsidies. In both cases, a variety of entrepreneurs from the private, public and academic sectors with different roles, goals, incentives, resources, knowledge and policy levers drive the development of their energy system. It depends on the actual situation on who has the incentives and resources to be in charge and act and to include others when it seems necessary.|$|R

Finally, the pertinence of the Marshallian concept of normal will be demonstrated as will its <b>divergent</b> <b>developments</b> by Shackle and Kornai.
