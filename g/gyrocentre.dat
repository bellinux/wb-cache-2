40|$|Gyrokinetics is a maximally optimal {{description}} of low-frequency magnetised plasma turbulence. We present a generalisation of gyrokinetic theory that allows dynamic strong flows and is valid for arbitrary-wavelength electrostatic potential perturbations in slab magnetic geometry. We obtain a substantially simpler <b>gyrocentre</b> Lagrangian {{than that of}} Dimits (2010 a,b). We present a symplectic strong-flow generalisation of gyrokinetic field theory such that, unlike Dimits (2010 a,b), our Vlasov-Poisson system is manifestly conservative as, ultimately, we obtain it as a whole, directly from our <b>gyrocentre</b> particle Lagrangian (Scott and Smirnov, 2010). Despite the symplectic representation of our strong-flow theory, our Poisson equation is consistent with that for weak flows (Hahm, 1988) at all wavelengths and the fluid equation obtained from our Vlasov-Poisson system is consistent with fluid theory. Again, despite our symplectic representation, we demonstrate numerical tractability by solving implicit dependences using an iterative scheme. Weak-and strong- flow code verification are performed in limits that admit analytic comparison. Simulations show strong-flow symmetry breaking of the Kelvin-Helmholtz in-stability of a shear layer and blobs that manifest as asymmetries in the growth rate and propagation, respectively, that depend on {{the sign of the}} parallel vorticity...|$|E
40|$|Subsequent to {{the recent}} {{rigorous}} derivation of an energetically consistent gyrokinetic collision operator in the so-called Landau representation, this paper investigates the possibility of finding a differential formulation of the gyrokinetic Landau collision operator. It is observed that, while a differential formulation is possible in the gyrokinetic phase space, reduction of the resulting system of partial differential equations to five dimensions via gyroaveraging poses a challenge. Based on the present work, {{it is likely that}} the <b>gyrocentre</b> analogues of the Rosenbluth-MacDonald-Judd potential functions must be kept gyroangle dependent. Comment: 11 page...|$|E
40|$|We reanalyse an arbitrary-wavelength gyrokinetic {{formalism}} [A. M. Dimits, Phys. Plasmas 17, 055901 (2010) ], which orders {{only the}} vorticity {{to be small}} and allows strong, time-varying flows on medium and long wavelengths. We obtain a simpler <b>gyrocentre</b> Lagrangian up to second order. In addition, the gyrokinetic Poisson equation, derived either via variation of the system Lagrangian or explicit density calculation, is consistent {{with that of the}} weak-flow gyrokinetic formalism [T. S. Hahm, Phys. Fluids 31, 2670 (1988) ] at all wavelengths in the weak flow limit. The reanalysed formalism has been numerically implemented as a particle-in-cell code. An iterative scheme is described which allows for numerical solution of this system of equations, given the implicit dependence of the Euler-Lagrange equations on the time derivative of the potential.

40|$|A gyrokinetic {{reduction}} {{is based on}} a specific ordering of the different small parameters characterizing the background magnetic field and the fluctuating electromagnetic fields. Here we consider the following ordering of the small parameters: ϵ_B=ϵ_δ^ 2 where ϵ_B is the small parameter associated with spatial inhomogeneities of the background magnetic field and ϵ_δ characterizes the small amplitude of the fluctuating fields. In particular, we do not make any assumption on the amplitude of the background magnetic field. Given this choice of ordering, we describe a self-contained and systematic derivation which is particularly well suited for the gyrokinetic reduction, following a two-step procedure : Using a translation in velocity, we embed the transformation performed on the symplectic part of the <b>gyrocentre</b> reduction in the guiding-centre one. Using a canonical Lie transform, we then eliminate the gyroangle dependence from the Hamiltonian. We derive the fully electromagnetic gyrokinetic equations at the second order in ϵ_δ...|$|E
