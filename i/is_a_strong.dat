5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> substitution effect.

5|$|Hydrochloric acid can {{therefore}} be used to prepare salts called chlorides. Hydrochloric acid <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> acid, since it is completely dissociated in water.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{inorganic}} acid {{that is used}} in many industrial processes such as refining metal. The application often determines the required product quality.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer {{of one or two}} electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E

Beef and dairy cattle are also raised widely, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> fishing culture. Fisheries and commercial fishing are common and seafood features widely in Welsh cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong,</b> competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed.

5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium {{hydroxide}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap {{has the ability}} to thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.|$|E
5|$|Within Durham's colleges, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{competitive}} rivalry. Castle's main rival is Hatfield College, {{which is}} Durham's second oldest college, having separated from Castle in the 1850s. The rivalry is maintained by student pranks and tricks and in various intercollegiate sporting events.|$|E

5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> metal with low density {{that is quite}} ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
