500|$|Classical network {{analysis}} develops {{a set of}} network equations whose network variables are homogeneous in either current (loop analysis) or voltage (node analysis). [...] The set of network variables so found {{is not necessarily the}} minimum necessary to form a set of <b>independent</b> <b>equations.</b> [...] There may be a difference between the number of variables in a loop analysis to a node analysis. [...] In some cases the minimum number possible may be less than either of these if the requirement for homogeneity is relaxed and a mix of current and voltage variables allowed. [...] A result from Kishi and Katajini in 1967 is that the absolute minimum number of variables required to describe the behaviour of the network is given by the maximum distance between any two spanning forests of the network graph.|$|E

2500|$|Putting {{it another}} way, {{according}} to the Rouché–Capelli theorem, any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix {{is greater than the}} rank of the coefficient matrix. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions. The rank of a system of equations (i.e. the rank of the augmented matrix) can never be higher than [...] + 1, which means that a system with any number of equations can always be reduced to a system that has a number of <b>independent</b> <b>equations</b> that is at most equal to [...] + 1.|$|E

40|$|The {{linearity}} and quietness of the Local (< 10 Mpc) Hubble Flow (LHF) {{in view of}} {{the very}} clumpy local universe is a long standing puzzle in standard and in open CDM cosmogony. The question addressed in this paper is whether the antigravity component of the recently discovered dark energy can cool the velocity flow enough to provide a solution to this puzzle. We calculate the growth of matter fluctuations in a flat universe containing a fraction Ω_X(t_ 0) of dark energy obeying the time <b>independent</b> <b>equation</b> of state p_X = w ρ_X. We find that dark energy can indeed cool the LHF. However the dark energy parameter values required to make the predicted velocity dispersion consistent with the observed value v_rms≃ 40 km/sec have been ruled out by other observational tests constraining the dark energy parameters w and Ω_X. Therefore despite the claims of recent qualitative studies dark energy with time <b>independent</b> <b>equation</b> of state can not by itself explain the quietness and linearity of the Local Hubble Flow.
