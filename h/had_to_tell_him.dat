500|$|Originally in {{the climax}}, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it {{when you get to}} the top!' I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I didn't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Walter Neff {{was not only}} a heel, he was a weak and malleable heel – many Hollywood actors including Alan Ladd, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March passed on it. Wilder even recalls [...] "scraping the bottom of the barrel" [...] and approaching George Raft. Raft was illiterate, so Wilder <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the plot. About halfway through, Raft interrupted him with, [...] "Let's get to the lapel bit." [...] "What lapel bit?" [...] a bewildered Wilder replied. [...] "The lapel," [...] the actor said, annoyed by such stupidity. [...] "You know, when the guy flashes his lapel, you see his badge, you know he's a detective." [...] This was his vision of the film, and since it wasn't part of the story, Raft turned the part down. Wilder finally realized that the part should be played by someone who could not only be a cynic, but a nice guy as well.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{was profoundly}} deaf and communicated on-field with his {{teammates}} in sign language. [...] He {{is credited with}} helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including {{but not limited to}} the use of pitching signs. [...] According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, [...] "The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him {{as a member of the}} family. [...] Player-manager George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same. [...] John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902." [...] In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, Fred Snodgrass, recalled:We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him. [...] He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team. [...] If we went to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> [...] So we all learned. [...] We practiced all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "We 'ad {{another long}} argyment about it, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'im</b> plain at last that when I wanted to smell 'is fist, I'd say so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don't you {{understand}} that that's exactly what I'm working for? You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him--about the way you've let it all drop: you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> a tremendous lot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here comes Colonel Morris," [...] went on Twyford, still {{speaking}} to Symon. [...] "One {{of us will}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how the light went out. Will you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dane found Barrington, {{who listened}} with a grim smile {{to what he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Guy {{was still}} awake, {{and able to}} hear what she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about Philip.|$|E
60|$|It {{was next}} day when Dane arrived at Winnipeg, and Winston listened gravely to all he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I was joking, but {{she said}} seriously, [...] "Yes; he must go away. And I don't envy you <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I suppose you will bungle it, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will. But I feel {{at present}} that I would rather change places with the poorest gentleman I know than <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I <b>have</b> done with races, Lupton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Adelaide Chadd bitterly. [...] "I {{suppose we}} shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about this. I thought that no good fortune would ever come easily to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had got {{herself into}} it; she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he wasn't just a {{business}} man; {{that she had}} [...] "just meant" [...] he was so practical.|$|E
6000|$|... "He had us hauled {{up before}} him--guess {{the other man}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> who we were--and when I wouldn't answer he slashed me with a sled-dog-whip across the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] I interrupted, [...] "your {{father knew}} all the scroll <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> else {{he could not have}} copied it on Gumbo. So why was he in such a rage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he'll be all right, {{but if he}} wouldn't, and I knew it, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> all the same. Now, good-night. Well, there, then; and there! Now, let me go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{he were to}} {{come back}} again this instant, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> just the same, or else <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about that--that--and you know I couldn't do that if I lived a {{thousand}} years." ...|$|R
6000|$|The exultation {{with which}} he uttered this helped me somehow, for the instant, to meet him rather more. [...] "And how much will YOU, Miles, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him?</b> There are things he'll ask you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Paddy the Beaver {{listened to}} all that his small cousin, Jerry Muskrat, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about the trouble which Paddy's dam had caused in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care, Ben--I {{just felt}} I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> It's {{a shame to}} let Nat cotton to fellows like Jasniff and Merwell. They will drag him down as sure as fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know now," [...] I said, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how I {{knew before}} he would answer another question. Then I became listener, and you who read know to what {{alarming}} story.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the truth, Spud, {{although}} we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> smooth over Mr. Sanderson's {{manner as}} much as we can. There's no use in hurting Songbird's feelings, especially now when he's broken up physically as well as mentally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{sooner or}} later, Mrs. Munger!" [...] said Mrs. Gerrish, with overweening {{pleasure}} in her acquaintance {{with both of}} these superior people. [...] "He'll {{get it out of}} you anyway." [...] Her husband looked at her, and she fell silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} will be {{necessary}} to put a lady into a boat on such a sea as this," [...] said Burke. [...] "But when he hears what Shirley <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> that Captain will most likely be glad enough to turn back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} help us," [...] he said--and {{then he gave}} an {{attentive}} ear (looking all the while at the poor creature in the corner) to what Mrs. Crosscapel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{beautiful}} bedside," [...] he said, [...] "one of {{the most}} edifying that I have ever attended. I knew that Doomer was failing {{and of course the}} time came when I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody there?" [...] cried Westover, {{and they}} fell upon the coachman with wild {{question}} and reproach; the policeman <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> at last that the carriage must move on, {{to make way}} for others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he is," [...] said Hartley, sitting up, with {{a sudden}} air of determination. [...] "But then, so am I. I {{am not going to}} be {{dictated}} to in this fashion. My private affairs are nothing to do with <b>him.</b> I—I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of {{that the}} way I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> I should begin by giving him a scolding. Of course, he meant well by it, but can't you see that it wasn't very flattering! How did he expect it would change me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hetty trembled a little. [...] "It {{is going}} to be the hardest thing I ever did. He is just dreadful in his {{quietness}} when he is angry--and I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I <b>had</b> been meeting Larry and sending him dollars. You know what he would fancy." ...|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{for what}} she now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{was very hard to}} say, and she knew what a terrible blow she would be dealing to his heart, from the wild beating of her own.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{was only}} {{too willing to}} go when he heard what Bob <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> and in the team he had driven over in he started at nearly as rapid a pace as Jim had.|$|E
6000|$|The first news {{his wife}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> was {{the sudden death of}} Absalom Crowninshield, the rich buccaneer. It was {{announced}} in the papers with the usual flourish, that [...] "a great man had fallen in Israel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lew is different," [...] replied Colonel Zane with a shudder. [...] "If I {{told him}} to take an ax and clean out Metzar's place--God! what a wreck he'd make of it. Maybe I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> and if I do, you'll see {{something}} you can never forget." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{winked at}} Sam, and then, {{whistling}} very cheerful, took his 'orse {{out and put}} it in the cab. He was so good-tempered that 'e got quite playful, and Sam <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that when 'e wanted <b>to</b> <b>'ave</b> his legs tickled with a straw he'd let 'im know.|$|R
60|$|Our {{conversation}} at that first encounter would do {{very little to}} develop the Modern Utopia in my mind. Inevitably, it would be personal and emotional. He would tell me how he stood in his world, and I how I stood in mine. I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> things, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> explain things----.|$|R
