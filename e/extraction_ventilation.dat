40|$|Ventilation {{represents}} {{a significant part}} of heat loss in winter, leading to the need to minimize airflow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to address the environmental issues that arise during the extraction of phosphate ore at Abu-Tartour mining area, Western desert, Egypt. Although the mine locates in the heart of the desert, the mining operations for ore extraction either from the underground mine, or from the surface mining work, do have several environmental impacts that affect the human being, agriculture, and natural resources (groundwater and rare animals). Those impacts are occurring during loading, unloading, mining operations (development, <b>extraction,</b> supporting, <b>ventilation,</b> blasting) and washing ol the ore.

30|$|We intubated {{our patient}} using the Airway Scope in a semirecumbent {{position}} under conscious sedation {{because she was}} considered to have a fully dilated abdomen {{and the absence of}} spontaneous respirations would cause ventilatory failure. In addition, the semirecumbent position effectively prevented hypoxemia due to increased compression of the lungs as well as supine hypotensive syndrome. The Airway Scope is useful in a variety of positions (Komasawa et al. 2010) and, as in previous reports, (Suzuki et al. 2009) we were able to perform successful tracheal intubation using the Airway Scope in a semirecumbent position. We elected to maintain spontaneous respirations because controlled ventilation would have been difficult owing to elevated intra-abdominal pressure during tumor fluid extraction. To maintain spontaneous respiration, analgesia was performed using local anesthetic infiltration and no muscle relaxants were used. Maintaining spontaneous respiration with pressure-supported ventilation and PEEP prevented hypoxemia and hypercapnia. As the abdominal pressure decreased after tumor fluid <b>extraction,</b> controlled <b>ventilation</b> could be easily achieved.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of different mechanical <b>extraction</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems in reducing and controlling dust concentrations in weaned and finishing pig houses was analyzed and {{discussed in this}} work. Dust concentrations and airflow velocities have been measured at 20 measuring points, smoothly positioned over the house cross section, in the net consisting of 4 horizontal and 5 vertical rows. The lowest horizontal row was positioned at the pigs breathing zone (40 cm above the floor), and the highest (fourth) horizontal row was positioned at the workers breathing zone (160 cm). Control values were measured in houses with closed doors and windows and all the fans switched off. These values were compared with three experimental sets of values achieved with: floor, roof and both ventilation systems. Dust concentrations were measured by konimeter (Konimeter 10, Karl Zeiss Jena), airflow velocity in ventilation ducts with a turbine anemometer and the airflow velocity at measuring points with hot wire anemometer.

40|$|As {{measurement}} of {{arterial oxygen saturation}} (SpO 2) is common in the delivery room, target SpO 2 ranges allow clinicians to titrate oxygen therapy for preterm infants {{in order to achieve}} saturation levels similar to those seen in normal term infants in the first minutes of life. However, the influence of the onset of ventilation and the timing of cord clamping on systemic and cerebral oxygenation is not known. We investigated whether the initiation of ventilation, prior to, or after umbilical cord clamping, altered systemic and cerebral oxygenation in preterm lambs. Systemic and cerebral blood-flows, pressures and peripheral SpO 2 and regional cerebral tissue oxygenation (SctO 2) were measured continuously in apnoeic preterm lambs (126 ± 1 day gestation). Positive pressure ventilation was initiated either 1) prior to umbilical cord clamping, or 2) after umbilical cord clamping. Lambs were monitored intensively prior to intervention, and for 10 minutes following umbilical cord clamping. Clamping the umbilical cord prior to ventilation resulted in a rapid decrease in SpO 2 and SctO 2, and an increase in arterial pressure, cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen <b>extraction.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> restored oxygenation and haemodynamics by 5 - 6 minutes. No such disturbances in peripheral or cerebral oxygenation and haemodynamics were observed when ventilation was initiated prior to cord clamping. The establishment of ventilation prior to umbilical cord clamping facilitated a smooth transition to systemic and cerebral oxygenation following birth. SpO 2 nomograms may need to be re-evaluated to reflect physiological management of preterm infants in the delivery room...|$|E
30|$|Measuring CNT risks as {{catalyst}} composites {{is possible}} in multiple ways. First, alloying CNTs using metals such as Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Pt, Au, Hg and their oxides through physical and/or chemical adsorptions is not stable; {{there is a chance}} of releasing significant amount of metal particles into the environmental milieu. Secondly, each doped metal has its own specific properties that might influence parental CNT’s properties and ultimately the overall behaviour of the composite. For example, Fe is popular to magnetize the CNT catalyst for ease of recycling, which could generate hydroxyl radicals that affect cell viability [41]. These might impact nanosafety risk assessment strategies, and one should count the final composite’s biocompatibility, health risks and toxicity issues before developing a safety guideline. Thirdly, disinfection of microbes using CNT’s composite is important. CNT-Ag-TiO 2 has shown direct antimicrobial effects and is popularly used for rupturing bacterial cell walls [42]. However, such treatment could be lethal, since a few bacteria especially Cyanobacteria could be responsible for releasing more toxic compounds, i.e. microcystins, while decontaminating through the CNTs [2]. Fourthly, photodegradation and catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) of persistent organic pollutants using CNT-metal catalysts have produced various degradation products and/or their intermediates which could be more toxic than their parent compounds and harmful to health [43]. Therefore, before assuming that CNT-metal composites are completely safe to use as a photocatalyst and catalytic wet-air oxidant, one should also keep in mind the degraded product’s reactivity, toxicity and fate in the environment. Finally, scientists need to isolate parental CNTs from doped metal for recycling. Although dry or wet cutting techniques are available for cutting and/or grinding of CNT composites [44], there is a significant chance of creating aerosols of free short CNT/metal fragments. Surface water and lands will be the ultimate destinations of any atmospheric release of CNTs and should be treated with caution. Therefore, handling CNT-metal composites in liquid media or instating <b>extraction</b> <b>ventilation</b> while processing will be helpful.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the risk {{analysis}} evaluation about argon release from the GERDA experiment in the Gran Sasso underground National Laboratories (LNGS) of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN). The GERDA apparatus, located in Hall A of the LNGS, is a facility with germanium detectors located in a wide tank filled with about 70 m 3 of cold liquefied argon. This cryo-tank sits in another water-filled tank (700 m 3) at atmospheric pressure. In such cryogenic processes, the main cause of an accidental scenario is lacking insulation of the cryo-tank. A preliminary HazOp analysis has been carried out on the whole system. The risk assessment identified two possible top-events: explosion due to a Rapid Phase Transition - RPT and argon runaway evaporation. Risk analysis highlighted a higher probability of occurrence of the latter top event. To avoid emission in Hall A, the HazOp, Fault Tree and Event tree analyses of the cryogenic gas <b>extraction</b> and <b>ventilation</b> plant have been made. The failures related to the ventilation system are the main cause responsible for the occurrence. To improve the system reliability some corrective actions were proposed: the use of UPS and the upgrade of damper opening devices. Furthermore, the Human Reliability Analysis identified some operating and management improvements: action procedure optimization, alert warnings and staff training. The proposed model integrates the existing analysis techniques by applying the results to an atypical work environment and there are useful suggestions for improving the system reliability...|$|R

Room’s dimensions (6 m x 6 m in plant and 4 m height) and lighting from above are compatible with uses as show-room of art gallery or museum, class room and lecture room. The device includes an heliostat with variable geometry, that can exploits direct or sky diffuse solar radiation as function of season and weather conditions. During the cold season the direct radiation, if present, is re-directed inside the room on diffusing ceiling. During the warm season the device modifies its configuration and allows to enter only to the fraction of sky diffuse radiation that is required for daylighting.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{energy and}} cost efficient single dwellings for Peab. It is our ambition that an energy efficient alternative to traditional Peab construction methods {{and that this}} will be the continuation of the thesis specific case Oxled in Partille. A series of buildings have been proposed in the thesis, however the design of the buildings have rather been a method of investigation than a result. Instead, the main focus has been to gain knowledge in energyefficient building techniques. It is essential to adjust the design to the specific concrete project. In order to test the building system and the design, energy simulations have been conducted in Derob where the Swedish passive house requirements have been a guideline. The final model is a building that fulfils the passive house requirements. The model costs 5 % more than a project that has been planed for 2010 by Peab according to quantitative surveying however the difference in heating costs makes the investment profitable. A deeper analysis of the combination of air duct and mechanical <b>extraction</b> <b>ventilation</b> is conducted. As the air heat exchanger often is considered good enough in Sweden, air ducts are rare in Swedish passive houses. However in Germany, Austria and Switzerland the air duct, often in combination with an air heat exchanger, is standard. According to calculations in the thesis, the model with an air duct will consume close to the same amount of energy as the same model with an air heat exchanger, but the indoor climate will be improved. The model is designed as a passive house, either with air duct or heat exchanger. In connection with this analysis humidity is investigated in an energy perspective. It is displayed {{that it is possible to}} save energy by considering production of humidity as lost energy. We that write this thesis are architecture and a civil engineering student; together we have taken a broad perspective on energy efficiency and have investigated numerous cost and energy saving solutions. It has not been possible to include all of these solutions in the final model. They have instead been investigated as side tracks in the thesis. In order to give the thesis a base numerous actors in the Swedish building industry have been contacted and many interviews and study visits have been made. Other important parts have been Chalmers Architecture, the institution of Design for Sustainable Development, the institution Build physics, Peab Sweden and Passivhuscentrum...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} after initial surveys indicated that lead (Pb) {{was present at}} concentrations {{in excess of the}} occupational exposure limit (OEL) on the matte tapping floor (MTF). A follow up study was designed in accordance with the Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual (OESSM), to determine personal exposure levels of the tappers to Pb whom are employed on the MTF. Following the initial static samples taken during the identification phase, follow up static samples were taken during the follow up personal exposure survey. This enabled us to determine if there were any significant changes in conditions between the initial and static samples. Simultaneously personal samples were taken on a representative group of the 30 tappers employed in the furnace building on the two tapping floors. Samples were taken over a 12 hour period due to the shift duration worked by the tappers. A decision was taken to compare the MTF and the slag tapping floor (STF) due to the similarities in the processes used on both floors. In order to evaluate the possible effect of lead on the workers employed as "tappers", a group of 30 workers employed in the furnace on the tapping floors of the Polokwane Smelter building were evaluated. The group consists of 30 men from multicultural urban environments. This group was further divided into smokers and non-smokers. Personal samples were conducted on 16 of the workers in the aforementioned group of “tappers", who were randomly selected to ensure a top 10 % exposure, with a 90 % confidence level as prescribed by OESSM. A short calculation gave an indication that the exposure to Pb according to the Lead Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act), Act 85 of 1993, the OEL for Pb other than tetraethyl Pb is 0. 15 mg/m 3 for an 8 -hour shift would decrease to 0. 10 mg/m 3 for a 12 -hour shift. This value was then used to compare exposure levels to the adapted statutory limits. Lead serves no useful purpose in the human body, and it's presence in the body can lead to toxic effects, regardless of the exposure pathway. The blood lead level (BLL) could be expected to be between 1 and 5 µg/dL in rural people and around 13 µg/dL in urban The results of the BLL tests performed during the study however indicated that all BLL were under 10 µg/dL, which indicated that the current control measures that are in place are keeping the exposure of the tappers to Pb down. The amount of time per individual spent on the MTF is being kept to a minimum by rotating the 30 tappers on a shift basis, which means that a particular employee will only work for one shift on the MTF before being rotated to another area within the plant. The results obtained showed that there is {{no significant difference between the}} initial and static samples taken on the MTF and STF. The BLL tests performed on the group of tappers were cross-referenced against the risk factors that were identified, as being possible sources of non-occupational sources of exposure to Pb. No significant results were obtained for this comparison showing no effect on the BLL's due to non-occupational exposures to Pb. Lastly there was a significant difference between the personal exposures measured at the MTF and the STF, indicating that there is a higher level of Pb in the ambient atmosphere of the MTF. This was expected, due to the fact that Pb is a heavy metal and would tend to group and sort with the rest of the valuable metals, which are found on the MTF. The electric arc furnace is designed to incorporate a slant downward from the STF to the MTF. Bone dry concentrate is fed pneumatically into the furnace. The concentrate which is in powder form is then smelted and reaches a temperature of approximately 1500 °C. In the time it takes for this concentrate to be smelted and reach a fluid state, the valuable heavy metals, including lead, move down the slope toward the MTF and to accumulate where it can then be "tapped" out by opening the tap hole on the MTF. However a small amount of Pb and other heavy metals like: platinum, gold, rhodium, rubidium, silver, etc., remain caught up in the mixture and are passed out along with the waste product slag, on the STF. This explains why small amounts of Pb were also found in the ambient atmosphere of the STF. Recommendations were made to improve on the current <b>extraction</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, to increase the effective uptake of Pb from the ambient atmosphere on the MTF whilst the molten metal is being allowed to run along the launder to the ladle. By optimising the shift rotation roster it could be ensured that the minimum amount of time is spent on the MTF by each individual. An increased awareness of personal hygiene, and standard operating procedures could further decrease personal exposure to Pb. The problem however lies in decreasing the amount of airborne Pb on the MTF to below the OEL, and as an interim this area has been declared a respirator zone. Personal Protective Equipment (F'PE) was the only effective form of control at the time of the survey. Half mask respirators with chemical cartridges, which along with dust filters present a barrier between the lungs and the ambient atmosphere of the MTF. Master...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{measure the}} {{concentrations}} of particles less than 100  nm diameter and of oxides of nitrogen generated by cooking with gas and electricity, to comment on possible hazards to health in poorly ventilated kitchens.  METHODS—Experiments with gas and electric rings, grills, and ovens were used to compare different cooking procedures. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured by a chemiluminescent ML 9841 A NOx analyser. A TSI 3934  scanning mobility particle sizer {{was used to measure}} average number concentration and size distribution of aerosols in the size range 10 - 500 nm.  RESULTS—High concentrations of particles are generated by gas combustion, by frying, and by cooking of fatty foods. Electric rings and grills may also generate particles from their surfaces. In experiments where gas burning was the most important source of particles, most particles were in the size range 15 - 40 nm. When bacon was fried on the gas or electric rings the particles were of larger diameter, in the size range 50 - 100 nm. The smaller particles generated during experiments grew in size with time because of coagulation. Substantial concentrations of NOX were generated during cooking on gas; four rings for 15  minutes produced 5  minute peaks of about 1000  ppb nitrogen dioxide and about 2000  ppb nitric oxide.  CONCLUSIONS—Cooking in a poorly ventilated kitchen may give rise to potentially toxic concentrations of numbers of particles. Very high concentrations of oxides of nitrogen may also be generated by gas cooking, and with no <b>extraction</b> and poor <b>ventilation,</b> may reach concentrations at which adverse health effects may be expected.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{energetic}} adaptations and {{constraints of the}} little penguin in relation to its aquatic lifestyle and examines the possible function of sleep as an energy conserving mechanism. The little penguin had a similar level of standard metabolic rate to other birds. Body temperature was lower than the general avian level and varied with the site of, measurement. Although penguins may be considered cold-adapted due to the thermal consequences of immersion; {{the results of this}} study and analysis of published data for other species shows minimal conductance in penguins appears to be relatively high in comparison to other cold-adapted birds due to the shallow insulative layer provided by the penguins waterproof plumage. This limitation is to some extent compensated by a well-developed capacity to alter body insulation. Water represents a severe thermal challenge to the little penguin since the potential for heat loss is two orders of magnitude greater than in air. Heat balance in water was maintained by prevention of excessive heat loss through insulative changes. Limits to the extent of insulation restrict the ability of the little penguin to withstand low water temperatures. Respiratory ventilation in the little penguin was rr. uch less than expected due to a low respiratory frequency and conferred a very high oxygen <b>extraction</b> coefficient. <b>Ventilation</b> during cold exposure rerrained closely associated YJith rPetabolic demands. The high gas exchange efficiency in the little penguin correlates well with its short aerobic diving patterns. Heat exposure resulted in large increases in ventilation and the limited capacity of little penguins to withstand heat exposure is in part explained by low tolerance to changes in. acid-base status. The metabolic response to wind in the little penguin varied with temperature. At thermoneutrality increased convective heat loss with wind was compensated by an increase in body insulation. During cold exposure body and plumage insulation had attained maximal values whereupon increased windspeed resulted in a linear increase in metabolic heat production. The dense, overlapping feathers of the little penguin, however, provide an effective resistance to increased heat loss associated with windspeed. The primary effect of wind upon partitional insulation at neutral and cold temperatures was a decrease in the insulation provided by the thermal boundary layer. Little penguins showed similar electrophysiological correlates of sleep to other birds and exhibited polyphasic sleep patterns. This study showed that the amount of sleep increased at night due to increased frequency of sleep periods and decreased during cold exposure due to a reduction in the length of sleep periods. Sleep was associated with decreased metabolic rate compared to values in quiet wakefulness. This decrease, however, represented only a marginal reduction in daily energy costs...|$|R
