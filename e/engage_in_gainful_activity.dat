30|$|The SSI and SSDI {{programs}} {{are designed to}} provide income support to those with significant disabilities {{who are unable to}} work at substantial levels. To qualify for either program, an applicant must demonstrate an inability to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> (SGA) due to a medically determinable impairment that is expected to last at least 12  months or to result in death. In 2014, SSA considers earnings above $ 1, 070 per month as SGA for most applicants. SSDI eligibility is also contingent on having a sufficient number of recent and lifetime quarters of Social Security-covered employment. The SSDI benefit level is based on past earnings; individuals with higher lifetime earnings are eligible for higher SSDI benefits. SSI is a means-tested program, with eligibility subject to strict income and asset limits. The SSI payment is based on the individual’s monthly income and living arrangement. Individuals may qualify for both programs if their incomes (including SSDI benefits) and assets are low enough to meet the SSI income limits.|$|R
5000|$|The legal {{definition}} of a disability that qualifies an applicant for benefits is: “inability to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> any substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which {{can be expected to}} result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.” [...] For adult applicants, Social Security Administration regulations specify a five-step process for making the decision. [...] A modified process is used in the case of children for whom Supplemental Security Income benefits are being claimed (as children are not expected to work).|$|R
30|$|Both {{programs}} use {{the same}} health criteria to determine eligibility. The Social Security definition requires an “inability to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> any substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment which {{can be expected to}} result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months 9 ”. “Substantial gainful activity” is defined as working on a regular and continuing basis and earning over $ 830 a month (in 2005) 10. The disability must be “demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques”. This restriction is not overly strict in part due to the liberalization of the DI program that occurred in 1984.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to {{traditional forms of}} private and public medical insurance, two other large programs help pay for costs associated with ill health. In 2007, Workers Compensation (WC) insurance provided $ 55. 4 billion in medical care and cash benefits to employees who are injured at work or contract a work-related illness, and Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) provided $ 99 billion to individuals who suffer from permanent disabilities and are unable to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity.</b> During the 1990 s, real DI outlays increased nearly 70 percent, whereas real WC cash benefit spending fell by 12 percent. There has been concern that part of this relationship {{between two of the}} nation’s largest social insurance programs may be due to individuals substituting towards DI as state WC policies tightened. We test this hypothesis using a number of different WC and DI program parameters. We first show that this negative correlation between the national series does not hold over time within states, the level at which a causal relationship should operate. We then test how regulatory changes in state WC program parameters impact WC outcomes (intended effect) and DI outcomes (unintended effect). We find no compelling evidence of WC tightening causing DI rolls to increase, and conclude it is unlikely that state WC changes were a meaningful factor in explaining the rise in DI. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{estimates}} of the causal effects of SSDI receipt on labor supply that are generalizable to {{the entire population of}} program entrants in the present day system. We take advantage of a unique workload management database to match Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) applicants to disability examiners, and use natural variation in examiners’ allowance rates to estimate the labor supply effects of SSDI. Because applicants are randomly assigned to examiners (conditional on observable characteristics), examiner specific allowance rates can be used to instrument for the allowance decision in a labor supply equation contrasting denied vs. allowed applicants. We find that the labor force participation rate of the marginal entrant would be on average 21 percentage points greater in the absence of SSDI benefit receipt. His or her likelihood of <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> as defined by the SSDI program would be on average 13 percentage points higher, and he or she would earn $ 1, 600 to $ 2, 600 more per year on average in the absence of SSDI benefit receipt. The marginal entrant is likely to have a mental impairment, be young, and have low pre-onset earnings. Importantly, the disincentive effect varies across individuals with impairments of different degrees of unobservable severity, ranging from a low of 10 percentage points for those with more severe impairments to a high of 60 percentage points for entrants with relatively less severe impairments...|$|R

However, many more indicate that their personal goals include work or that they see themselves working in the near future. This brief presents information about the number, characteristics, and employment-related activities of working-age SSI and SSDI beneficiaries who report having work goals or expectations. We refer to these individuals as “work-oriented” beneficiaries. 3 The statistics shown are from a more detailed report (see Livermore et al. 2009) and are based on analyses of a nationally representative survey of working-age SSI and SSDI beneficiaries. 4 The survey data were matched to SSI and SSDI administrative data and to annual Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earnings records to analyze the earnings and benefit receipt of survey respondents during, and three years after, the year of interview. 5 How many working-age SSI and SSDI beneficiaries are work-oriented, and how do they differ from other beneficiaries? In 2004, 40 percent of working-age disability beneficiaries reported having work goals or expectations.

40|$|The {{question}} posed {{in this chapter}} is: To what extent does current education theory and practice prepare graduates for the creative economy? We first define {{what we mean by}} the term creative economy, explain why we think it is a significant point of focus, derive its key features, describe the human capital requirements of these features, and then discuss whether current education theory and practice are producing these human capital requirements. The term creative economy can be critiqued as a shibboleth, but as a high level metaphor, it nevertheless has value in directing us away from certain sorts of economic activity and toward other kinds. Much economic activity is in no way creative. If I have a monopoly on some valued resource, I {{do not need to be}} creative. Other forms of economic activity are intensely creative. If I have no valued resources, I must create something that is valued. At its simplest and yet most profound, the idea of a creative economy suggests a capacity to compete based on <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> a <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> that is different from everyone else’s, rather than pursuing the same endeavor more competitively than everyone else. The ability to differentiate on novelty is key to the concept of creative economy and key to our analysis of education for this economy. Therefore, we follow Potts and Cunningham (2008, p. 18) and Potts, Cunningham, Hartley, and Ormerod (2008) in their discussion of the economic significance of the creative industries and see the creative economy not as a sector but as a set of economic processes that act on the economy as a whole to invigorate innovation based growth. We see the creative economy as suffused with all industry rather than as a sector in its own right. These economic processes are essentially concerned with the production of new ideas that ultimately become new products, service, industry sectors, or, in some cases, process or product innovations in older sectors. Therefore, our starting point is that modern economies depend on innovation, and we see the core of innovation as new knowledge of some kind. We commence with some observations about innovation...|$|R
40|$|M ore than 80 {{percent of}} all nonelderly adults in the United States areinsured against {{the risk of being}} unable to work because of a {{physical}} ormental disability by the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) pro-gram.

To be awarded benefits, an individual must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or to last {{for at least a year}} and that prevents the person from <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> a “substantial <b>gainful</b> <b>activity.</b> ” During the past two decades, the fraction of individuals receiving Disability Insurance benefits has grown substantially, as shown in Figure 1.

If recent entry and exit rates continue in the years ahead, then more than 6 percent of the nonelderly adult population will soon be receiving DI benefits. The rapid expansion of the beneficiary population has three main causes. First, a set of congressional reforms in 1984 to Disability Insurance screening led to rapid growth in the share of recipients suffering from back pain and mental illness. Because these disorders have comparatively low mortality, the average duration of disability spells—and hence the size of the recipient population—has increased. Second, a rise in the after-tax DI income replacement rate—that is, the ratio of disability income to former labor earnings—strengthened the incentives for work...|$|R

40|$|Despite recent {{drops in}} rates, {{juvenile}} incarceration remains {{a serious issue}} in the United States (Hockenberry, 2013; Mendel, 2011). One shared part of the incarceration experience across different systems and facility types is the obligation for juvenile offenders to receive correctional education. Ample research demonstrates that increased academic achievement, attending community school, and being employed are connected to better community outcomes and desistance, yet {{little is known about}} how school experiences in the facility influences these outcomes. Applying life-course theory of the development of crime (Sampson 2 ̆ 6 Laub, 1997, 2005), the present study investigates whether correctional education serves as a turning point to influence a number of community adjustment outcomes in serious juvenile offenders. Specifically, it tested how subjective (teacher bonding and school orientation) and objective (grades, time spent in the facility school) parts of the school experience during the facility stay were related to transitioning to community schools (attendance), and/or work (<b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> and employment), self-reported delinquency, and staying in the community at 6 and 12 months after release for a sample of 519 male and 50 female serious juvenile offenders. Results showed that across juvenile and adult facilities, improved attachment to the facility school while incarcerated predicted increased involvement <b>in</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>activity</b> and decreases <b>in</b> self-reported delinquency up to 12 months after release. This positive effect was greatest for younger offenders who returned to school, even when accounting for the number of previous facility stays and prior community school experiences. Conversely, older offenders who returned to gainful employment showed less positive adjustment. In contrast to other studies, grades received while incarcerated were not a significant predictor of community adjustment. Overall, the results repeatedly show behavioral differences based on individual history and experiences during incarceration across different types of facilities, strongly supporting a research agenda that treats incarceration as more than a binary variable. The present results add to the corpus of evidence that the perspective of the incarcerated juveniles matter and suggest that the school experience while incarcerated can serve as an important turning point, indicating resources should be directed towards enhancing juveniles’ school orientation and relationships with teachers...|$|R
