40|$|The use of drift bottles as a {{means of}} {{charting}} ocean currents is an old one, and their use in fisheries research is not without precedent. In the North Sea, particularly, investigations of the oceanic circulation have been carried on {{over a number of years}} by this means and have shed light on a great variety of fisheries problems. The circulation of the waters off the coast of southern California was, at the beginning of the present survey, very incompletely charted. It was felt that a more detailed knowledge of hydrographic conditions would materially assist in the interpretation of some of the problems relating to the life-history of the sardine (Sardinops caerulea) and some of the other commercial fishes. The present survey was designed to chart surface circulation throughout the region of maximum spawning of the sardine. As the California State Fisheries Laboratory possessed neither the equipment nor the personnel for a detailed hydrographic survey of the region, it was decided that drift bottles should be used as the most convenient method of obtaining data on the surface circulation. Drift methods have two distinct advantages: the bottles are inexpensive to prepare and no special training or equipment is necessary to carry out their release. After Dr. H. U. Sverdrup, Director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was consulted concerning the plans for the <b>drift</b> <b>bottle</b> investigation, it was proposed that the Scripps Institution, which was then seriously handicapped by the loss of their research vessel, carry on a program of water sampling concurrently with the <b>drift</b> <b>bottle</b> releases as an additional means of obtaining data on the circulation of the region in question. This arrangement proved to be most satisfactory as the information obtained by dynamic methods was more detailed and provided a much better picture of conditions than would have been possible by the drift bottles alone.

40|$|The {{response}} of the west Florida: continental shelf circulation to monthly mean climatological wind forcing is investigated by using the three-dimensional, primitive equation Princeton Ocean Model. Two basic seasonal patterns of circulation and sea surface elevation occur under a barotropic setting: A winter pattern from October to March and a summer pattern from April to September. An interesting finding in winter is an anticyclonic gyre over the northeastern (Florida Big Bend) region that merges with a northwestward flow from the south. The Big Bend Gyre {{is caused by a}} convergence of two separate flows: A nearshore along-shelf southeastward flow and an offshore northwestward flow. Winter circulation characteristics also include offshore surface transport, coastal upwelling, and relatively low coastal sea level. The summer pattern features a continuous northwestward directed flow, onshore surface transport, coastal downwelling, and relatively high coastal sea level. Transitions between the two seasonal patterns show either a development or relaxation of the Big Bend Gyre. These three-dimensional circulation patterns result from wind-driven Ekman transports and their resulting surface-slope-induced geostrophic flows. Qualitative agreement exists in some respects with recent in situ observations, historical. <b>drift</b> <b>bottle</b> retrievals, and tide gauge data. However, climatological wind stress forcing alone does not account for the seasonally varying southeastward currents observed at, midshelf.
