25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> absurd.|$|E

Talis believes that Library 2.0 means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.|$|E

2500|$|... 神道 Shéndào ("Way of the God"), in the Yijing, is {{the path}} or way of manifestation of God and the gods. «It is too {{delicate}} to be grasped. It cannot be perceived through reason. It cannot {{be seen through}} the eyes. It does without knowing how it can do. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> the Way of the God». Since the Qin and Han dynasty [...] "Shendao" [...] became a name defining Chinese religion as the shèjiào 社教, [...] "social religion" [...] of the nation.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who have}} spoken Latin and {{have used the}} {{language}} correctly do not give to the word humanitas the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία (philanthropy), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to humanitas {{the force of the}} Greek παιδεία (paideia); that <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes, or [...] "education and training in the liberal arts". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed humanitas, or [...] "humanity".|$|E
2500|$|A guajeo is {{a typical}} Cuban ostinato melody, most often {{consisting}} of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. A piano guajeo may be played during the verse section of a song, but {{it is at the}} center of the montuno section. That is why some salsa musicians refer to piano guajeos as montunos. Piano guajeos are one of the most recognizable elements in salsa music. As Sonny Bravo explains: [...] "In salsa, the piano is more of a percussion instrument than a melodic one, especially in ensemble playing. When you're backing a soloist, you play a riff over and over again. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> guajeo. The pianist uses this guajeo to provide the rhythm section with its drive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) {{heavily criticized}} Virgin Galactic {{within hours of}} the accident. Tommaso Sgobba, Executive Director of the IAASS, claimed that Virgin Galactic had refused to let IAASS {{scientists}} review its procedures and snubbed industry gatherings. He stated: [...] "They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. They use outdated methods like testing and then seeing what happens. There has been no independent oversight. There is no peer review. I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen." [...] Sgobba, the former head of flight safety for the European Space Agency, said on November 6, 2014 that industry best practice called for operators to build in [...] "two-failure tolerance", or sufficient safeguards to survive two separate, unrelated failures—two human errors, two mechanical errors or one of each. [...] "What we see in the incident <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> 'zero-failure tolerance'," [...] Mr Sgobba said. [...] "So you make the mistake—you have a catastrophe. The design would not be acceptable in other safety-critical industries, such as aircraft manufacture." [...] Other members of IAASS also commented on the accident in the immediate aftermath. Rocket propulsion expert and rocket powered dragster driver Carolynne Campbell-Knight was quoted as saying that Virgin Galactic [...] "...should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones. They should stay out of the space business." [...] Campbell-Knight also stated that an explosion of the nitrous oxide hybrid propulsion system was the cause of the accident, although the initial NTSB report did not indicate that the propulsion system contributed to the breakup of the vehicle.|$|E
