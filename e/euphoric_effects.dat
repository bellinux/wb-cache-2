50|$|Many cough medications, {{including}} Buckley's, {{have become}} popular as recreational drugs in recent years. Due to the dissociative properties of dextromethorphan, {{high doses of}} cough medication {{can be used to}} produce an intoxication. Only 100 mg of dextromethorphan is needed to create a <b>euphoric</b> <b>effect.</b> The lethal dose is between 2,000 mg and 20,000 mg.|$|R
25|$|As it has <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> {{similar to}} other opioids, {{oxycodone}} {{is one of the}} drugs abused in the current opioid epidemic in the United States. An abuse-deterrent combination with naloxone is available in managed-release tablets. If injected, the naloxone precipitates opioid withdrawal symptoms and blocks the effect of the medication. However, there have been concerns raised about the effectiveness of the abuse prevention measures.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects,</b> it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan's <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> have {{sometimes}} {{been attributed to}} an increase in dopamine levels, since such an increase generally correlates with pleasurable responses to drug, as is observed with some clinical antidepressants, as well as some recreational drugs. However, the effects of dextrorphan and dextromethorphan, and other NMDA receptor antagonists, on dopamine levels is a disputed subject. Studies show that the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and PCP do raise dopamine levels, although other studies show that another NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine has no effect on dopamine levels. Some findings even suggest that dextromethorphan can actually counter the dopamine-increasing effect caused by morphine. Due to these conflicting results, the actual effect of dextromethorphan on dopamine levels remains undetermined.|$|E

Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} for people to {{experience}} pleasurable and even <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> from ingesting capsaicin.

2500|$|Methcathinone (α-methylamino-propiophenone or ephedrone) (sometimes called [...] "cat" [...] or [...] "jeff" [...] or [...] "catnip" [...] or [...] "intash" [...] ) is a monoamine {{alkaloid}} and psychoactive stimulant, a substituted cathinone. It {{is used as}} {{a recreational}} drug due to its potent stimulant and <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> and is considered to be addictive, with both physical and psychological withdrawal occurring if its use is discontinued after prolonged or high-dosage administration. It is usually snorted, but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally.|$|E
2500|$|Dopamine is {{the primary}} {{neurotransmitter}} involved in the reward pathway in the brain. Thus, drugs that increase dopamine signaling may produce <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects.</b> Many recreational drugs, such as cocaine and substituted amphetamines, inhibit the dopamine transporter (DAT), the protein responsible for removing dopamine from the neural synapse. When DAT activity is blocked, the synapse floods with dopamine and increases dopaminergic signaling. When this occurs, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, increased D1 and decreased D2 receptor signaling mediates the [...] "rewarding" [...] stimulus of drug intake.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrous oxide has {{significant}} medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anaesthetic and pain reducing effects.

2500|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} its {{mechanism}} of action relating to dopamine receptors, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that aripiprazole blocks cocaine-seeking behavior in animal models without significantly affecting other rewarding behaviors (such as food self-administration). There is also some evidence suggesting that systemic administration of aripiprazole in a rat model of cocaine addiction may result in reduced relapse-like behavior in adolescents. Aripiprazole may be counter-therapeutic as treatment for methamphetamine dependency because it increased methamphetamine's stimulant and <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects,</b> and increased the baseline level of desire for methamphetamine. s ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sumerians {{are said}} to have {{cultivated}} and harvested the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) in lower Mesopotamia as early as 3400 BCE, though this has been disputed. The most ancient testimony concerning the opium poppy found to date was inscribed in cuneiform script on a small white clay tablet {{at the end of the}} third millennium BCE. This tablet was discovered in 1954 during excavations at Nippur, and is currently kept at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Deciphered by Samuel Noah Kramer and Martin Leve, it is considered to be the most ancient pharmacopoeia in existence. Some Sumerian tablets of this era have an ideogram inscribed upon them, [...] "hul gil", which translates to [...] "plant of joy", believed by some authors to refer to opium. The term gil is still used for opium in certain parts of the world. The Sumerian goddess Nidaba is often depicted with poppies growing out of her shoulders. About 2225 BCE, the Sumerian territory became a part of the Babylonian empire. Knowledge and use of the opium poppy and its <b>euphoric</b> <b>effects</b> thus passed to the Babylonians, who expanded their empire eastwards to Persia and westwards to Egypt, thereby extending its range to these civilizations. British archaeologist and cuneiformist Reginald Campbell Thompson writes that opium was known to the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. The term [...] "Arat Pa Pa" [...] occurs in the Assyrian Herbal, a collection of inscribed Assyrian tablets dated to c. 650 BCE. According to Thompson, this term is the Assyrian name for the juice of the poppy and it may be the etymological origin of the Latin [...] "papaver".|$|E

50|$|The driving {{principle}} behind ORT is the program's {{capacity to}} facilitate a resumption of stability in the user's life, while they experience reduced symptoms of withdrawal symptoms and less intense drug cravings; however, a strong <b>euphoric</b> <b>effect</b> is not experienced {{as a result of}} the treatment drug. In some countries (not the USA, UK, Canada, or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time period for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved.

In practice, 40-65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy, and 70-95% are able to reduce their use significantly, while experiencing a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illicit opioids.|$|R

40|$|Toluene is an {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon with widespread industrial {{use as an}} organic solvent. As {{a result of the}} <b>euphoric</b> <b>effect</b> and availability of these substances, inhalation of toluene-based products is popular among young adults and children. Chronic or acute exposure is known to cause acid–base and electrolyte disorders, and to be toxic to the nervous and hematopoietic systems. We report a 38 -year-old man who suffered from general muscular weakness of all extremities after toluene sniffing, which was complicated with hypokalemic paralysis, atrioventricular conduction abnormality, and normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Renal function, serum potassium and acid–base status normalized within 3 days after aggressive potassium chloride and intravenous fluid replacement. Electrocardiography showed regression of first-degree atrioventricular block. Exposure to toluene can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden sniffing death syndrome. Tachyarrhythmia is the classical manifestation of toluene cardiotoxicity. Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities have been rarely mentioned in the literature. Knowledge of the toxicology and medical complications associated with toluene sniffing is essential for clinical management of these patients...|$|R
