500|$|The RAIB {{investigation}} into the accident reported that the outward working, reporting number 1Z21, the 07:22 from [...] to , had been fitted with a numbered plastic tie on {{the handle of the}} Automatic Warning System (AWS) <b>isolating</b> <b>cock.</b> The train was driven to Bristol without incident, although some misting of the driver's window was reported. The driver of that train was not the driver later involved in the SPAD at Wootton Bassett. During an empty coaching stock movement to St Philip's Marsh depot, the emergency brake applied because the driver did not cancel an AWS warning in the allotted time. The AWS <b>isolating</b> <b>cock</b> was opened, breaking the seal. On leaving St Philip's Marsh, a similar incident occurred, and the AWS <b>isolating</b> <b>cock</b> was opened again. There was a change of traincrew on arrival at Bristol Temple Meads, where the return working was designated 1Z67. According to the rulebook, the driver of the train should have reported the missing seal on the AWS <b>isolating</b> <b>cock.</b> The train should not have been allowed to depart until the cock had been sealed. The driver did not do this, and set off with an unsealed cock.|$|E

An emergency brake application occurred on the train after it had passed over the magnet because the driver failed to press the AWS cancelling button within 2.7 seconds. The driver should have allowed the train to come to a stand and contacted the signalman, but he did not.

500|$|In {{the twelve}} seconds between brake {{application}} and brake release, the train {{passed over the}} fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no brake action was demanded from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS overspeed sensor for signal SN45, this time at , which was {{in excess of the}} [...] trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS <b>isolating</b> <b>cock</b> was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train. Due to there being insufficient distance to stop, the train overran the signal by [...] and came to a stand across Wootton Basset Junction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{attempts}} {{to describe the}} effects of social experience and to analyse the processes which lead in isolated animals to either normal sexual behaviour towards a specific partner, or to abnormalities in coordination and orientation in this sexual behaviour. io cockerels were maintained in physical and visual isolation until 5 months old and 10 "controls" were each raised {{in the presence of}} a female for the same length of time. Behaviour patterns were analysed in choice tests with naturalised models of congeners of varying colour and structure and, in confrontations with living hens. Intergroup comparisons reveal significant differences for most of the behaviour considered in the tests. Intragroup analysis shows that the control animals preferentially choose a sexual partner possessing colouration and, or, a structure similar to those of their home pen congenors. Isolated cockerels choose a partner with certain characters (in particular of colour) analogous to their own. Moreover the first mating attempts by these cockerels are more frequently in reversed position (head to tail). Some ambiguous results arising from tests with models of different structure seem to be due to the limitations of the adopted experimental procedures and from the fact that direct visual self-perception is not the only factor involved. The overall results obtained permit the acceptance of the hypothesis that an <b>isolated</b> <b>cock</b> perceives (self-perception) and becomes attached (self-fixation) to parts of its own body, but remains able to orient and adjust its behaviour towards a partner resembling itself. A more general discussion includes observations on the litterature concerned with deprivation of social experience in other species and contrasts the proposed interpretations...|$|R
