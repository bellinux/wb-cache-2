5|$|Former {{singer and}} pop star Junaid Jamshed had close links with Tabligh Jamaat, and his {{departure}} from his professional singing career <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to his inclination towards the movement.|$|E
5|$|In Thomas Deloney's novel Thomas of Reading (1600) the {{invention}} of the Halifax Gibbet <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to a friar, who proposed the device as a solution to the difficulty of finding local residents willing to act as hangmen.|$|E
5|$|Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pKa {{value of}} 12.1. It {{is one of}} the strongest amine bases known. The high {{basicity}} <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding.|$|E
50|$|Every {{creation}} {{produced by}} the studios <b>was</b> <b>attributed</b> to Hergé only, except for three albums of Quick & Flupke which <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to the Studios on the cover.|$|R
50|$|The {{killing of}} six Christian missionaries during the Nanjing Incident of 1927 has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the {{influence}} of the movement, but can also <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to more generalized xenophobia.|$|R
25|$|Thus {{the call}} of No ball protects the batsman against losing his wicket in ways that <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to the bowler, but not in ways that <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to running, or to his own conduct.|$|R
5|$|Saibaba is now revered as {{incarnation}} of Sri Dattatreya, and considered as Saguna Brahma. He <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> {{to be the}} creator, sustainer and destroyer of this universe by his devotees.

5|$|The MacIntyres of Rannoch, were {{hereditary}} pipers to {{the chiefs}} of Clan Menzies and composed {{some of that}} clan’s music. They supplied hereditary pipers to the MacDonalds of Clanranald, and a noted pibroch commemorating the battle of Sheriffmuir <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> {{to one of these}} MacIntyres.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed. The changing of the pelage of arctic animals <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to the indirect effect {{of the change in}} temperature, i.e. a physiological response not a simple physical effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} {{piezoelectricity}} in Topaz can probably <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to such ordering.|$|R
5000|$|East side: {{the seven}} [...] "Liberal Arts" [...] — Astronomy, Music, Geometry, Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, and Arithmetic. (Geometry and Rhetoric <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to Andrea Pisano; the others, except Astronomy, <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to Gino Micheli da Castello).|$|R
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{formulation}} of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to British scientist Paul Dirac, who (during the 1920s) {{was able to}} compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur Schopenhauer {{argued for}} a two-sided view of reality which was both Will and Representation (Vorstellung). According to Schopenhauer: [...] "All {{ostensible}} mind can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to matter, but all matter can likewise <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to mind".|$|R
40|$|Three-quarters {{of deaths}} due to asthma in Australia occur among people aged 55 years or older. Many more deaths and hospitalisations in older people <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD). Between 1997 and 2003, 318 deaths per year <b>were</b> <b>attributed</b> to asthma and 5581 deaths per year <b>were</b> <b>attributed</b> to COPD among Australians aged 55 and over. How {{can we do}} better than we are now in dealing with this problem...|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{closeness}} in style to these masters, Dandoy's unsigned works have regularly <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Joris van Son and even Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Some {{of his paintings}} have mistakenly <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to G. van Deynum, another follower of de Heem active in Antwerp in the 1650s. [...] His [...] auctioned at Thierry de Maigret on 11 June 2010 (Paris, lot 31) has previously <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to circle of de Heem.|$|R

5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old. His {{retirement}} <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to his government position not {{allowing him to}} travel. He had briefly retired after his brother Jim's death in 1904. McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45games (both league and challenge). Only Russell Bowie rivals his average of 3 goals per game.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña {{considered}} his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} into certain musical compositions that have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Father Martin but no definitive conclusions have been reached.

25|$|Blake was {{reported}} to have said this on his birthday in 1979, but it has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to others and appeared in print at least as early as 1966 (when it <b>was</b> <b>attributed</b> to an anonymous 90-year-old golf caddie).|$|R
5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E
5|$|Although a few Dominican missionaries worked {{together}} to establish the University– including Miguel de Benavides, Bernardo Navarro, and other old professors from the higher {{colleges and universities in}} Spain– the founding of the University <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> mainly to Miguel de Benavides, the first to give a fund for the maintenance of the institution.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E
50|$|Frans Verbeeck did {{not leave}} any known signed paintings. A fair number of {{compositions}} with Hieronymus Bosch-like subjects, that could not <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to Bosch followers such as Jan Mandijn or to Pieter Huys, have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to him.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{on the theme of}} players, [...] (Musée de Picardie), has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to de Vos based on its similarity with the work in Stockholm. Previously it <b>was</b> <b>attributed</b> to the French follower of Caravaggio, Valentin de Boulogne.|$|R
