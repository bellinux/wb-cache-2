5|$|Al-Talaba {{returned}} to winning ways under {{the management of}} Jamal Ali in the 1988–89 season, which was played in a different <b>format</b> <b>to</b> previous seasons.

5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff <b>format</b> <b>to</b> the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; {{they were in the}} same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E

5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems <b>format</b> <b>to</b> a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try {{a high-quality}} digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared in the}} summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp <b>format</b> <b>to</b> digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both Amazing and Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.|$|E

Love Productions then suggested the <b>format</b> <b>to</b> Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film <b>format</b> <b>to</b> depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E
