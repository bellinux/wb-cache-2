40|$|ABSTRACT: The shape {{adaptive}} DCT is {{a widely}} used tool for coding of arbitrarily shaped image segments due to its rather low complexity. However, having been primarily designed for intraframe coding, we will show in this paper that the transform is clearly suboptimal when applied to <b>interframe</b> <b>coding.</b> Using a suitable covariance model we show that a rescaled, orthonormalized transform much closer approximates the optimal shape adaptive eigentransform of motion compensated difference images. Rate distortion curves verify that orthonormalization improves the coding efficiency in <b>interframe</b> <b>coding</b> by up to 2 dB while not adding to complexity. ...|$|E

The SVC extension of the H. 264 /MPEG- 4 (Part 10) Advanced Video Coding (AVC) is the latest video codec based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of ITU-T and ISO/IEC [37]. Although H. 264 has many technical advantages, it also has some shortcomings [38, 39], e.g., full scalability is not well supported due to the usage of hierarchical B-pictures. An alternative technique for video coding is wavelet-based coding, which has some advantages over current H. 264 [40, 41]. In addition, the method of <b>interframe</b> wavelet <b>coding</b> overcomes this drawback through the use of motion compensation temporal filtering (MCTF) to achieve scalability without additional system-related overhead. In addition, the structure of open-loop prediction in <b>interframe</b> wavelet <b>coding</b> provides greater flexibility in bitstream extraction and robustness against transmission impairment when no feedback is available. In addition, wavelet-based coding has less variability in video distortion distribution and better robustness in cases of transmission error, compared with DCT-based coding.
