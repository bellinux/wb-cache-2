5|$|The San Juan {{watershed}} {{is home to}} sixteen major native plant {{communities and}} hundreds of animal species. However, the watershed is projected to be 48 percent urbanized by 2050.

5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho.

The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion <b>in</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural. The creek has since been channelized along most of its length to prevent floods from inundating the roads and houses that now line much of its banks.|$|E
