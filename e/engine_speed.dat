5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|The Hayabusa's {{abundance}} of power at any <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> made the Hayabusa easier to ride {{by giving the}} rider a greater choice of gear selection for a given speed and stunning acceleration.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium-alloy casting {{fitted to}} rear of crankcase. Carries the supercharger; and houses drives to the supercharger, {{auxiliary}} gearbox coupling, <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> indicator, airscrew constant-speed unit, intercooler pump and fuel pump, {{as well as}} the oil and coolant pumps in the lower half crankcase.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal superchargers add {{additional}} boost as {{the speed}} of the motor increases. This means the centrifugal supercharger will provide more horsepower at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and less boost at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... i-VTEC is {{the acronym}} for {{intelligent}} VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), an evolution of Honda's VTEC engine. The i-VTEC engine works by controlling {{the timing and}} lifting of the camshafts depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The valves open a small amount during low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. The valves will open wider at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve higher performance.|$|R
50|$|Extreme {{oversquare}} {{engines are}} found in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> of 18,000 RPM while remaining reliable for multiple races.|$|R
25|$|The T-50 Golden Eagle {{design is}} largely {{derived from the}} F-16 Fighting Falcon, and they have many similarities: use of a single <b>engine,</b> <b>speed,</b> size, cost, {{and the range of}} weapons. KAI's {{previous}} engineering experience in license-producing the KF-16 was a starting point {{for the development of the}} T-50.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the spark}} voltage is also {{dependent}} on contact effectiveness, and poor sparking {{can lead to}} lower engine efficiency. A mechanical contact breaker system cannot control an average ignition current of more than about 3 A while still giving a reasonable service life, and this may limit {{the power of the}} spark and ultimate <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was praised}} by its pilots, {{including}} John Salmond, later to become Chief of the Air Staff, its landing speed of 52mph (84km/h) was considered {{too fast for}} operational use, and the engine was still too unreliable, being replaced by a 100hp (75kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. With this <b>engine,</b> <b>speed</b> fell to a less impressive 92mph (148km/h).|$|E
50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>speed</b> of the <b>engine.</b> This means that at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> the steering would naturally operate faster than at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches {{the end of its}} stroke.|$|R
5000|$|While small-displacement, short-stroke automomobile {{engines are}} capable of very high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{motorcycle}} <b>engines</b> can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower reciprocating mass. For example, the 1986-1996 Honda CBR250RR inline 4-stroke has a redline of about 19,000 rpm. (Though due to regulations in Japanese motorcycle manufacturing this was later lowered to 18,000). While 4-stroke engines of small displacement {{are capable of}} very high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> it is once again the lack of useful torque at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> due to [...] "efficiency" [...] requirements mandating small displacement engines with supposedly reduced emissions that require high speeds.|$|R
50|$|Higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> can be reached, since burning {{continues}} in the prechamber.|$|R
25|$|Twin-turbo or {{bi-turbo}} designs {{have two}} separate turbochargers operating {{in either a}} sequence or in parallel. In a parallel configuration, both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engine’s exhaust. In a sequential setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> or load. Sequential turbochargers further reduce turbo lag, but require an intricate set of pipes to properly feed both turbochargers.|$|E
25|$|When Rolls-Royce Diesels {{introduced}} their C range engine, it {{was adopted}} by locomotive builders for use in Diesel-hydraulic locomotives. These benefited from having a faster running engine (1800 rpm). Likewise, YEC used the C series engines in a new range of locomotives, {{the first of which}} was introduced in 1955 and which continued to evolve until 1965, the higher <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> being an advantage for diesel-electric locomotives as well.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{starboard}} engine ran normally {{after it was}} decoupled from the reduction gear, a likely reason for the sudden drop of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> from 1,000 to 270 rpm and subsequent stalling when reconnected was increased load in the propulsion system due to damaged shaft bearing or a foreign object, perhaps something that had fallen from the deck, wedged in the propeller duct, although malfunction in the fuel supply and lubrication system due to the violent pitching of the vessel were not ruled out.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} work, {{the effect of}} using CPO (crude palm oil) –OD (ordinary diesel) blends as fuel on the {{performance}} of CI (compression ignition) engine is studied. Three different blends of CPO–OD (25 %, 50 % and 75 %) were investigated using direct-injection, stationary diesel engine. The CPO–OD blends were preheated to about 60 °C before the injection to reduce the viscosity of the blends. The experiments were conducted at variable <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> (1000 rpm through 3000 rpm) under fixed throttle opening. The results revealed that the CPO–OD exhibited higher torque and power output at <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> lower than 2000 rpm, while the BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) was found to be higher than the OD at the same <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> CPO enhanced the BSFC at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> (above 2000 rpm). The CPO–OD blends exhibited lower emissions of NOx and higher emission of CO compared to the OD...|$|R
50|$|The engine's Variable-length Intake Manifold (VIM) {{switches}} {{between a}} long intake manifold at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{and a short}} intake manifold at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Proton cars use a longer intake manifold to achieve slower air flow; as {{it was found that}} promotes better mixing with fuel. The short intake manifold allows more air in faster. This is beneficial at high RPMs.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{modification}} depends greatly {{on the degree}} of performance enhancement desired, budget, and the characteristics of the engine to be modified. Intake, exhaust, and chip upgrades are usually amongst the first modifications made as they are the cheapest, make reasonably general improvements, whereas a different camshaft, for instance, requires trading off smoothness at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> for improvements at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{necessary}} accuracy in {{the control of the}} intake ramp and spill positioning, it was found necessary to use a digital signal processor in the Air Intake Control Units. This was developed relatively late in the programme (~1972) by the Electronics and Space Systems division of the British Aircraft Corporation at Filton, Bristol. The Air Intake Control Units ensured the required fuel economy for transatlantic flights. The digital processor also accurately calculated the necessary <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> scheduling to ensure an adequate surge margin under all engine and airframe operating conditions.|$|E
25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{turbo lag}} is mistaken for engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear. This wait for vehicle speed increase is not turbo lag, it is improper gear selection for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the turbo lag.|$|E
5000|$|This {{job would}} be simple if air and {{gasoline}} (petrol) were ideal fluids; in practice, however, their deviations from ideal behavior due to viscosity, fluid drag, inertia, etc. require {{a great deal of}} complexity to compensate for exceptionally high or low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A carburetor must provide the proper fuel/air mixture across a wide range of ambient temperatures, atmospheric pressures, <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and loads, and centrifugal forces: ...|$|R

25|$|To change up a gear, {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.|$|E
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} is {{the control of}} the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.|$|E
50|$|Most {{diesel engines}} {{now have a}} {{separate}} vacuum pump ("exhauster") fitted to provide vacuum at all times, at all <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Variable-geometry turbochargers (VGTs), (also {{known as}} {{variable}} nozzle turbines/VNTs), are {{a family of}} turbochargers, usually designed to allow the effective aspect ratio (A:R) of the turbo to be altered as conditions change. This is done because optimum aspect ratio at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{is very different from}} that at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> If the aspect ratio is too large, the turbo will fail to create boost at low speeds; if the aspect ratio is too small, the turbo will choke the <b>engine</b> at high <b>speeds,</b> leading to high exhaust manifold pressures, high pumping losses, and ultimately lower power output. By altering the geometry of the turbine housing as the engine accelerates, the turbo's aspect ratio can be maintained at its optimum. Because of this, VGTs have a minimal amount of lag, have a low boost threshold, and are very efficient at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> VGTs do not require a wastegate.|$|R
50|$|Introduced on {{launch in}} October 1993, the Second Generation Subaru Legacy GT {{introduced}} Subaru's new Sequential Twin Turbo version of their 1994cc flat-four engine. The new engine, {{known as the}} EJ20H, operated with one small turbocharger at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to give good throttle response, supplemented by a second turbocharger at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to give more power. Maximum power output was 250 ps (246.6 bhp) at 6,500 rpm and maximum torque was 308.9 Nm (227.8 lbf·ft) at 5,000 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{advance in}} supercharger design was the incorporation in 1938 of a two-speed drive (designed by the French company Farman) to the impeller of the Merlin X. The later Merlin XX incorporated the two-speed drive {{as well as}} several improvements that enabled the production rate of Merlins to be increased. The low-ratio gear, which operated from takeoff to an altitude of , drove the impeller at 21,597rpm and developed 1,240 horsepower (925kW) at that height; while the high gear's (25,148rpm) power rating was 1,175 horsepower (876kW) at [...] These figures were achieved at 2,850rpm <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> using +9 pounds per square inch (1.66atm) (48") boost.|$|E
500|$|Powered turret {{traverse}} {{was provided}} by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second — the same as with the Tiger I — [...] with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually turn the turret at one-half a degree per 360º turn.|$|E
40|$|An aeroacoustic {{test program}} to {{determine}} the cause of YF- 12 inlet noise suppression was performed with a YF- 12 aircraft at ground static conditions. Data obtained over a wide range of <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and inlet configurations are reported. Acoustic measurements were made in the far field and aerodynamic and acoustic measurements were made inside the inlet. The J- 58 test engine was removed from the aircraft and tested separately with a bellmouth inlet. The far field noise level was significantly lower for the YF- 12 inlet than for the bellmouth inlet at <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> above 5500 rpm. There was no evidence that noise suppression was caused by flow choking. Multiple pure tones were reduced and the spectral peak near the blade passing frequency disappeared in the region of the spike support struts at <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> between 6000 and 6600 rpm...|$|R
