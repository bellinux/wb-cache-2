50|$|Room and {{pillar mining}} : Room and pillar mining is {{commonly}} done in flat or gently dipping bedded ore <b>bodies.</b> <b>Pillars</b> {{are left in}} place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access, allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope. This allows for greater recovery as less ore is left behind in pillars.|$|R

50|$|During the {{six years}} of Royal Tiger production, home and export {{versions}} followed separate lines of development which were mirrored in series one Olympics. The HR series gearbox was a four-speed synchromesh unit and the brakes were (as standard) vacuum-assisted, in this it was a precursor to the home market Royal Tiger PSU1. The ER and EL specification buses used units from the forthcoming OPSU1 or OPSU2 (and later OPSU3) Royal Tigers, with air braking as standard and an air-assisted gearshift for the synchromesh gearbox. E-series Olympics tended to have an additional <b>body</b> <b>pillar</b> and hence shorter side glazing.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} a semi-autonomous robot for rescue operations, nicknamed RAPOSA (FOX in English). The robot {{was designed and}} built to operate in outdoor environments hostile to the human presence, such as debris resulting from the collapse of built structures, and is targeted to the tele-operated detection of potential survivors using a set of specic sensors whose information is transmitted to a remote human operator. RAPOSA's mechanical structure is composed of a main <b>body</b> and a <b>front</b> <b>body,</b> whose locomotion is supported on tracked wheels, allowing motion even when the robot is upside down. The <b>front</b> <b>body</b> has variable tilting capabilities, providing means to overcome edges higher than the robot main body (e. g., when climbing a stair) and is also useful to grab the lower ground when only the main body has ground contact. This <b>front</b> <b>body</b> has one thermal camera and two webcameras installed. Additional sensors include gas, temperature and humidity sensors, web cams, light diodes, microphone and loudspeaker. The robot uses wireless communications, with an option for tethered operation. The tether carries both power and communications, with an access point on its end, and {{can also be used}} to suspend the robot inside a deep hole. Docking and undocking the robot to the tether is accomplished remotely by the operator with the help of a camera located inside the robot, and represents the most innovative feature of RAPOSA.
