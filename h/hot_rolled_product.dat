40|$|The {{current work}} {{contains}} experimental and theoretical work about {{the formation of}} martensite from the austenitic state of the steel Hardox 450. Simulation of rolling and subsequent quenching of martensitic steel plates requires a model that can account for previous deformation, current stresses and the temperature history, therefore dilatometry experiments were performed, with and without deformation. Two austenitization schedules were used and in the standard dilatometry the cooling rates varied between 5 - 100 °C/s, {{in order to find}} the minimum cooling rate that gives a fully martensitic microstructure. Cooling rates larger than 40 °C/s gave a fully martensitic microstructure. The cooling rate of 100 °C/s was used in the deformation dilatometry tests where the uniaxial deformation varied from 5 - 50 %. The theoretical work involved modelling of the martensite formation and the thermal/transformation strains they cause in the steel. Characterizations were done using light optical microscopy, hardness tests and electron backscatter diffraction technique. The parent austenite grains of the martensitic structure were reconstructed using the orientation relationship between the parent austenite and the martensite. Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationships have previously been proven to work well for low-carbon steels and was therefore selected. The standard implementation of the Koistinen-Marburger equation for martensite formation and a more convenient approach were compared. The latter approach does not require the storage of initial austenite fraction at start of martensite formation. The comparison shows that the latter model works equally well for the martensite formation. The results showed that the use of martensite start and finish temperatures calibrated versus experiments for Hardox 450 works better when computing thermal expansion than use of general relations based on the chemistry of the steel. The results from deformation dilatometry showed that deformation by compressive uniaxial stresses impedes the martensite transformation. The simplified incremental model works well for deformation with 5 % and 10 %. However, the waviness in the experimental curve for deformation 50 % does not fit the model due vi to large barrelling effect and the large relative expansion for the material that the sample holders are made of. Crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite grains were performed on a hot-rolled as-received reference sample and dilatometry samples cooled with 60 °C/s and 100 °C/s. The misorientation results showed that the samples match with the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship in both <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> and dilatometry samples. When misorientation between adjacent pixels are between 15 ° and 48 °, then the boundary between them was considered as a parent austenite grain. The austenitic grain boundaries of the sample cooled at 100 °C/s is in general identical with the hot rolled sample when considering high angle boundaries (15 °- 48 °). The results from the hardness tests showed that the rolled product exhibits higher hardness as compared to samples cooled by 100 °C/s and 60 °C/s. This {{can be attributed to the}} formation of transition-iron-carbides in the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> due to longer exposure of coiling temperature...|$|E

40|$|PM 2000 is a Ni-free oxide {{dispersion}} strengthened Fe- 20 Cr- 5 Al alloy able {{to develop}} a fine, dense and tightly adherent α-alumina scale during high-temperature oxidation. Despite the high temperature involved during thermal oxidation (1100 °C), microstructural changes in the candidate material, a <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> hardly occurs. Consequently, the good mechanical properties of the as-received material are not significantly affected. Moreover, due to the high compressive residual stresses at the alumina scale, {{an increase in the}} fatigue limit from 500 to 530 MPa is observed. Such stresses also account for the high capability of the coating/metal system to withstand more than 1 % tensile deformation without cracking. The biocompatibility of the alloy was assessed in comparison to commercial alumina. Saos- 2 osteoblast-like cells were either challenged with PM 2000 particles, or seeded onto PM 2000 (with and without scale) solid samples. Viability, growth, and ALP release from cells were assessed after 3 or 7 days, while mineralization was checked at 18 days. This study has demonstrated that PM 2000 with and without scale are capable of supporting in vitro growth and function of osteoblast-like cells over a period of 18 days. Results from this study suggest that the resulting alumina/alloy system combines the good mechanical properties of the alloy with the superior biocompatibility of the α-alumina, for which there is very good clinical experience. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The pattern of the centerline segregation was modeled physically by preparing a sandwich structure of steel plates with different levels of carbon and alloying elements.

A {{thorough understanding of}} the available roll design methods, and conditions of their application is extremely important {{in order to achieve}} the objective of producing high quality <b>rolled</b> <b>products.</b> Successful <b>hot</b> <b>roll</b> design is dominated by the calculations of some important parameters, which describe two-dimensional (2 D) or three-dimensional (3 D) deformation in the workpiece. These parameters, such as roll separation force, torque, elongation, spread and draft, are discussed in detail. The method or formula for the calculation of each parameter is different for each set of different application conditions. A thorough study of these methods in different application cases will lead to the optimised design of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products.</b> Finite Element (EE) is an important method which has been employed in the study of hot rolling.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemical}} composition and processing parameters on {{the formation of}} acicular ferrite and its application for grain refinement of heavy <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products</b> has been investigated. It was concluded that vanadium effectively promotes the formation of acicular ferrite. In terms of thermal path, continuous cooling with two-stages cooling at 50 and 2 ºC/s with temperature change (TC) at 630 is especially suitable to favour acicular microstructures homogeneously distributed through thickness of a heavy plate. Results reported in this work allow us to conclude that acicular ferrite can only be achieved alloying with vanadium and nitrogen, meanwhile bainite is promoted in steels with {{a low level of}} nitrogen. It is concluded that higher strength values are obtained in acicular ferrite than in bainitic steel. In spite of the a priori better behaviour of the interlocked acicular ferrite microstructure, similar brittle – ductile transition temperature (BDT), and lower values of impact absorbed energy (KV) has been recorded in nitrogen-rich steel, which indicate that alloying the steel with vanadium and nitrogen to improve mechanical properties is not a successful strategyPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The final {{properties}} of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products</b> {{depend on the}} microstructure developed during the hot rolling process. The kinetics of thermomechanical events which determine the microstructure depend {{very much on the}} strain accumulated at each deformation. Aluminium and its alloys exhibit a high static recovery which reduces the strain in the interpass times, although this strain may be retrieved when applying a second deformation. This thesis is about determining the extent of static recovery in hot rolling in terms of a magnitude called 'Retained Strain', to be used in a computer model for hot rolling. A methodology to measure the extent of static recovery and retrieval of strain is proposed. This methodology is based on the development of empirical equations which were obtained after analysing experimental data from plane strain compression tests from two different sources. In the analysed data the extent of static recovery is related to the deformation conditions so that a relationship between static recovery and the Zener-Hollomon parameter is established. The retrieval of strain depends on the time interval between deformations, so that after very short intervals the strain retrieves immediately, even at very small second strains, but after very long intervals strain may not retrieve at all. The Sheffield Model for <b>hot</b> <b>Rolling</b> is modified to include simulation of static recovery and retrieval of strain. Industrial schedules for Al-l%Mg and c. p. A 1 are studied. With the 'Recovery model' recrystallization is inhibited. With the 'Retrieved model' the effects of recovery are almost eliminated. Modelling recovery and retrieval of strain has little effect on industrial hot rolling schedules designed to produce a full recrystallized final microstructure, but it is expected to have a major influence on other hot rolling schedules where a final fine subgrain microstructure, characteristic of recovery, is required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In all {{application}} fields for <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> strip <b>products</b> for direct processing, e. g. construction and engineering but also crane and truck industry, {{there is a}} strong customers demand for grades with increased strength levels and well balanced formability. At voestalpine Stahl GmbH these requirements were met with the development of the high strength microalloyed steel grade ALFORM 700 M and the ultra high strength steel grade ALFORM 900 M with a minimum yield strength (YS) of 700 MPa and 900 MPa, respectively. In the present paper investigations on the steel grades ALFORM 700 M and ALFORM 900 M are introduced. To explain the evolution of the obtained complex microstructures consisting of bainitic ferrite, bainite and martensite alloy design and industrial production process is discussed on the base of dilatometric experiments and TEM investigations.

40|$|Eutectoid steel strips are {{designed}} {{for the production of}} parts for intensive use such as clutches, seat slides, and springs as they exhibit excellent strength levels and wear resistance. These properties arise from the unique morphology of lamellar pearlite which can be considered as a self-laminated nanoscale composite. However, a spheroidization annealing step is nowadays necessary to improve the cold forming properties before further cold rolling steps. This thesis is aimed at improving the tensile ductility of the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products</b> of eutectoid composition in order to eliminate the intermediate annealing step. Two strategies are proposed. The first is to transpose the concept of controlled rolling developed for HSLA to eutectoid steels. Through a strict adjustment of the austenite processing and of the cooling strategy, it is possible to improve the ductility of the final lamellar microstructure. The way the processing parameters influence the hot deformation of austenite, the eutectoid transformation and of the subsequent spheroidization annealing is deeply investigated. It is found that refinement and pancaking of austenite is beneficial as it reduces the pearlite block size improving the total tensile elongation. Accelerated cooling is of paramount importance to achieve fine Interlamellar spacing (ILS), which lead to high strength levels and accelerate spheroidization during subsequent annealing. The second approach involves intercritical or warm deformation. Warm processing of eutectoid steels is first explored by torsion testing and then up-scaled to a pilot rolling-line. The interactions between thermomechanical parameters, rolling forces generated and microstructural evolution are carefully scrutinized. During concurrent hot deformation, spheroidization of cementite takes place almost instantaneously in both torsion and rolling. The restoration processes occurring in the ferrite matrix depends on the strain path and the strain rates. Low strain rates (0, 1 s− 1) and simple shear promotes the formation of a recrystallized-like HABs network of about 3 μm in size. Plane strain compression and high strain rates (10 s− 1) leads to the formation of a typical recovered dislocation substructure (LABs) of 1 μm in size. During annealing, no recrystallization occurs and the LABs substructure remains stable. This substructure influences drammatically the mechanical properties: the strength is very high and the work-hardening behavior is poor due to high recovery rate in the region close to the LABs. However, due to the presence of spheroidized cementite particles the ductility of warm rolled eutectoid steels is higher than that of ultra fine grained low carbon steels.
