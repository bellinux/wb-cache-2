25|$|Inclusive Democracy is a {{political}} theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, <b>economic</b> <b>democracy</b> in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, self-management (democracy in the social realm) and ecological democracy. The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy (ID; as distinguished from the political project {{that is part of}} the democratic and autonomy traditions) emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist Takis Fotopoulos in Towards An Inclusive Democracy and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal Democracy & Nature and its successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, an electronic journal freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.|$|E
25|$|Much of the IWW's {{organizing}} {{took place}} in the West, and most of its early members were miners, lumbermen, cannery, and dock workers. In 1912 the IWW organized a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers, and by 1917 the Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America. Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to workplace and <b>economic</b> <b>democracy,</b> the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000 members (with 200,000 membership cards issued between 1905 and 1916), but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many of its members killed, about 10,000 organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. The IWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today, but its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.|$|E

In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a regressive tax against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon <b>economic</b> <b>democracy</b> through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>economic</b> growth and <b>democracy</b> is a contentious {{issue in the}} literature of comparative politics and political economy.

Furthermore there are deviations between certain countries in terms of the {{relationship between}} <b>economic</b> growth and <b>democracy.</b> Thus, country specific models have critical importance to shed light on these deviations between those different countries. In this study, we construct a co-integration model of the Turkish economy {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>economic</b> growth and <b>democracy.</b> From its very foundation, Turkey has experienced economic and political crises.

2500|$|Sarkar {{therefore}} advocates an <b>economic</b> <b>democracy</b> {{where the}} decision-making {{power for the}} economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. <b>Economic</b> <b>democracy</b> {{is not a new}} term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one. [...] The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, PROUT argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region. Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike capitalism, where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a proutistic society it should be based on necessity [...] The third requirement of <b>economic</b> <b>democracy</b> is the decentralization of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders. That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system [...] and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) {{for the development of the}} region and not merely for export [...] In summary, PROUT advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units) [...]„ ... a local economy using local resources in a climate which fosters local initiative and industriousness for the collective welfare." [...] PROUT also indicates that outsiders must be kept out from interfering with the local economy [...] From a proutistic perspective, this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community [...] From a Neo-humanistic perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.“ In law, we grant individual rights only to the extent that they do not harm others. Prout includes this idea in economics. “ ...|$|E
2500|$|Inclusive {{democracy}} is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life: political democracy {{in the form of}} face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, <b>economic</b> <b>democracy</b> in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. self-management in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature.

2500|$|As well as {{representation}} on a corporation's {{board of}} directors, or top management, employees have sought binding rights (for instance, over working time, break arrangement, and layoffs) in their organizations through elected work councils. After the National War Labor Board {{was established by}} the Woodrow Wilson administration, firms established work councils with some rights throughout the 1920s. Frequently, however, management refused to concede the [...] "right to employ and discharge, {{the direction of the}} working forces, and the management of the business" [...] in any way, which from the workforce perspective defeated the object. As the US presidency changed to the Republican party during the 1920s, work [...] "councils" [...] were often instituted by employers that did not have free elections or proceedings, to forestall independent labor unions' right to collective bargaining. For this reason, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §158(a)(2) ensured it was an unfair labor practice for an employer [...] "to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, or contribute financial or other support to it". This was designed to enable free work councils, genuinely independent from management, but not dominated work councils or so called [...] "company unions". For example, a work council law was passed by the US government in Allied-occupied Germany called Control Council Law, No 22. This empowered German workers to organize work councils if elected by democratic methods, with secret ballots, using participation of free labor unions, with basic functions ranging from how to apply collective agreements, regulating health and safety, rules for engagements, dismissals and grievances, proposals for improving work methods, and organizing social and welfare facilities. These rules were subsequently updated and adopted in German law, although American employees themselves did not yet develop a practice of bargaining for work councils, nor did states implement work council rules, even though neither were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In 1992, the National Labor Relations Board in its Electromation, Inc, and EI du Pont de Nemours, decisions confirmed that while management dominated councils were unlawful, genuine and independent work councils would not be. The Dunlop Report in 1994 produced an inconclusive discussion that favored experimentation with work councils. A Republican Congress did propose a Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995 to repeal §158(a)(2), but this was vetoed by President Bill Clinton as it would have enabled management dominated unions and councils. In 2014, workers at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, sought to establish a work council. This was initially supported by management, but its stance changed in 2016, after the United Auto Workers succeeded in winning a ballot for traditional representation in an exclusive bargaining unit. As it stands, employees have no widespread right to vote in American workplaces, which has increased the gap between political democracy and traditional labor law goals of workplace and <b>economic</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
