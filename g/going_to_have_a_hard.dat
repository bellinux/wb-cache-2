5000|$|A large {{criticism}} {{for the game}} was its numerous bugs and glitches. Some reviewers speculate that the cause was a rushed development cycle to reach a scheduled release date. Matthew Gallant, writing for GameSpot gave the GameCube version of the game a 3.2/10 and the PlayStation 2 version a 2.8 saying [...] "Even the biggest fans of Spyro are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time enjoying this game. The leap to the latest generation of consoles leaves them with a slower game, a shorter game (10 hours), and an all-around less enjoyable game, {{not to mention a}} buggy one."." [...] Critics also reported that the technical issues extended to sound as well. Gamershell claims that, [...] "Let's remember some basic school knowledge first: sounds that origin from far away are more silent than sounds which are near us. Not so in Spyro.

5000|$|Paul Pettengale {{reviewed}} the AD&D CD-ROM Core Rules for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. He began the review by speaking {{about how many}} books are needed to run a game of AD&D, stating that [...] "The prospect, then, of having all the main rulebooks on a CD-ROM is rather appealing, providing, of course, you've got a PC handy when you're playing your session. Few Dungeon Masters play with a PC on the gaming table ... {{which seems to be}} a fundamental flaw with the whole premise of the Core Rules disc." [...] He found that [...] "the text is very easy to read, being presented in a large enough text size to make it clearly visible even on smaller monitors. Naturally, you can print the books ... and sections of each". Pettengale found the books [...] "relatively easy to navigate, thanks to the hypertext links" [...] but noted that there's no search feature - something I expected to find - which is a massive disappointment; because {{of the size of the}} files, it can take an age of scrolling to find precisely what you're after, even where hypertext links have been included. ... This is a clumsy way of finding information, and TSR could have made it a lot easier." [...] He also found that [...] "Another omission, which is perhaps inevitable given the format that the text has been presented in, is that there are no pictures in the books at all. This is fine, more or less, as far as the DMG, PHB and Tome of Magic are concerned, but illustrations are extremely useful when it comes to describing monsters that appear in the MM, and the Arms and Equipment book states right at the beginning that everything in it is illustrated, when in fact this is quite clearly not the case ... Because of the lack of illustration, it has to be said that the rulebooks as they are presented here on CD-ROM can be used as no more than an addition to the paper versions. If you've only got the CD-ROM, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time running AD&D." [...] Pettengale looked at [...] "the other features that the disc offers for added worth" [...] noting that the extra features are [...] "primarily designed to make a DM's life easier" [...] such as the character generator which he found to be [...] "an extremely fast way of rolling up a PC - the whole process, including proficiency choices and the purchase of equipment, can take as little as ten minutes (when done using the basic books, the creation of a 1st level character can usually take as long as two hours, so that's a big time saver). All of the dice rolling options are presented, so there's plenty of flexibility built in, though there's no way that you can 'cheat' - most DMs will let a player reroll a dice or two throughout the character generation process, especially if a Hit Points roll turns out to be a 1. Nevertheless, this is a very handy feature and, providing you don't use the excellent Skills and Powers sub-rules ... which aren't included as an option ... it will probably be used time and again." [...] He also commented on the DM tool to quickly create NPCs: [...] "I suggest you use this only for creating 'general' NPCs if you've got a major, long-standing villain to create, it's best to do it yourself" [...] and the map builder tool which [...] "sounds more interesting than it actually is - the maps you create with it look pretty poor". Pettengale concluded the review by saying [...] "Overall, I'm not terribly impressed with the AD&D CD-ROM Core Rules. It had a lot of potential, but that potential hasn't really been capitalised on. There could have been splendid illustrations of all the monsters included, but this is not the case; there should have been a search feature for locating rulings in a hurry, but this isn't the case either. Yes, some of the tools are jolly useful, but they aren't the kind of things you can do yourself with pen and paper and a bit of time. I can see myself using it, though only occasionally ... So, buy it if you've got money to burn, but this is not an essential purchase for all PC-owning DMs by any means." ...|$|E
