40|$|Background. The problem <b>of</b> <b>polysemy</b> has {{attracted}} scholars’ attention since antiq­uity {{and interest in}} the phenomenon never lessens. A substantial number of works have been published on the cognitive nature of meaning ambiguity. Despite a new emphasis on the cognitive aspects <b>of</b> <b>polysemy,</b> little has been done towards an inte­grated approach {{to the study of}} this linguistic phenomenon. Objective and Method. This work’s objective was to contribute to an integrated interdisciplinary theory <b>of</b> <b>polysemy.</b> To this end, we explored the cognitive founda­tion of meaning using empirical and theoretical research methods, but mostly relying on semiotic analysis of texts central to the humanities. In particular, we analyzed the dichotomy of conscious vs. unconscious processing in the acquisition and use <b>of</b> <b>polysemy.</b> For the identification of cognitive patterns <b>of</b> <b>polysemy</b> development in ontogenesis, we used probabilistic conceptual modeling. Results. The acquisition of meaning is a conscious process: it is a conscious interaction of the speaker with an interlocutor and their common social environ­ment. On the other hand, meanings are unconscious unless a connection between the phonological, acoustic form and the concept is established. Correspondingly, polysemy is conscious when a new meaning is formed in the course of social inter­action. However, polysemy, as an inherent language phenomenon, remains uncon­scious for native speakers, who are unaware of its presence provided they are not involved in some form of intentional language games (pun, zeugma or intended ambiguity). Conclusion. The present approach to the analysis of meaning ambiguity seems to be a productive endeavor. Further research into polysemy has to be based on a range of additional types of evidence, including those obtained by methods of cogni­tive neuroscience...|$|R

While it may restrict their practical utility, the weakness of these metacognitive criteria does not establish the absence of a cognitive distinction between ambiguity and vagueness.

40|$|Abstract. While {{polysemy}} {{is a form}} {{of ambiguity}} that can complicate natural language processing, it is also a rich lexical resource that yields useful insights into the mapping between words and concepts. WordNet, a comprehensive lexical knowledge-base of English word meanings, is replete with instances <b>of</b> <b>polysemy,</b> but also contains many instances of homonymy, and fails to distinguish between both kinds of ambiguity. We propose in this paper an alternative to the distributional approach for recognizing polysemous sensepairs in WordNet. Our approach does not rely on the systematicity <b>of</b> regular <b>polysemy</b> to identify the families of words that instantiate a particular metonymic pattern, but seeks instead local ontological evidence for each word, on a case by case basis, before polysemy is hypothesized. We argue that this approach is thus equally adept at recognizing instances <b>of</b> ad-hoc <b>polysemy.</b> ...|$|R
