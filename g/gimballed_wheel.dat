The system aimed {{as far as possible}} for realism, and therefore the slot was as narrow as possible (about 1/8 in) with brass conductors placed vertically at each side. The vehicles picked up power via a small <b>wheel</b> (called a <b>Gimbal</b> <b>Wheel)</b> on their underside, which was divided into two halves by an insulating flange. At some time in the 1960s this mechanism was replaced by a pair of vertically sprung sliding pickups. These differed from that of electric racing car systems such as the same company's Scalextric, in which the electrical conductors were spaced more widely apart {{on each side of the}} guide slot, and were hence more stable.There was a small removable peg at the back of the vehicles to stabilize it when in reverse.Vehicles were controlled by a hand-held controller, which had a thumb-operated speed control plus a rotating reversing switch.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{practical}} work {{in developing}} combined energy storage and attitude control subsystems for small satellites {{has opened the}} door to more complex, demanding space missions. Laden with substantial benefits such as agile slewing, robust singularity avoidance, increased lifetime, mass savings, and favorable peak power density, these recently proposed systems use variable-speed control moment gyroscopes to store and drain energy while controlling satellite orientation. The full non-linear equations for simultaneous control of <b>gimbal</b> and <b>wheel</b> motors for this system were presented and theoretically unraveled in previous work, however that implementation assumed a single computer dictates the commands to these motors at each time step. The limitation of this method is {{that it is difficult to}} control the <b>wheel</b> and <b>gimbal</b> motors separately as required to immediately implement the flywheel motors in the passive electronics of an existing satellite energy storage subsystem. Such isolated control would impart disturbance torques on the system from torquing the wheel motors, but does not allow the simultaneous steering laws controllability of the wheels, an underlying assumption of these laws. To address this need, a novel gimbal steering law is derived to permit independent <b>gimbal</b> and <b>wheel</b> control of the actuators with continued singularity avoidance, a situation that allows direct incorporation of such a system into an existing small satellite energy storage subsystem. This law rejects the disturbance torques generated during independent wheel control. As it permits directly interfacing this small satellite combined energy storage and attitude control subsystem into a conventional satellite, this novel, composite gimbal steering law is more immediately practical than pre-existing simultaneous steering laws...|$|R

The focus is on designing an adjustable skew angle single gimbal CMG frame, and integrating a previously developed momentum wheel assembly into it. The result of this phase is a fully operational CMG {{that can be used to}} retrofit the NPS Reconfigurable Satellite Autonomy Testbed (R-SAT). The open architecture design allows for both hardware and software upgrades to the R-SAT Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS). This capability is vitally important in order to support the development and testing of new satellite control algorithms that can be used to improve the agility and efficiency of satellite maneuvers.

The proposed controller functioning as a variable-speed control moment gyroscope steering law is developed {{in terms of the}} gimbal rates and the flywheel accelerations, which are weighted by a singularity measure. Specifically, using null motion, a strategy is developed to simultaneously perform gimbal reconfiguration for singularity avoidance and internal momentummanagement for flywheel startup. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to prove asymptotic attitude tracking and exponential internal momentum tracking despite the effects of uncertain, time-varying satellite inertia properties and uncertain actuator inertia properties.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{attitude}} control {{is provided by}} two means: The Russian Segment uses thrusters and the U. S. Segment uses double-gimbaled control moment gyroscopes (CMG). CMGs are used as momentum exchange devices, providing non propulsive {{attitude control}} for the vehicle. The CMGs are {{very important for the}} ISS program because, first, they save propellant - which needs to be transferred to the Station in special cargo vehicles - and, second, they provide the microgravity environment on the Station - which is necessary for scientific experiments planned for the ISS mission. Since 2002, when one of the CMG on the ISS failed, all CMGs are closely monitored. High gimbal rates, vibration spikes, unusual variations of spin motor current and bearing temperatures are of great concern, since these parameters are the CMG health indicators. The telemetry analysis of these and some other CMG parameters is used to determine constrains and make changes to the CMGs operation on board. These CMG limitations, in turn, may limit the ISS attitude control capabilities and may be critical to ISS operation. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether the CMG parameter is nominal or out of family, and why. The goal of this project is to analyze an important CMG parameter - spin motor current. Some operational decisions are made now based on the spin motor current signatures. The spin motor current depends on gimbal rates, ISS rates, and spin bearing friction. The spin bearing friction in turn depends on the bearing temperatures, wheel rates, normal load - which is a function of <b>gimbal</b> and <b>wheel</b> rates - lubrication, etc. The first task of this project is to create a spin motor current mathematical model based on CMG dynamics model and the current knowledge on bearing friction in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in expanding {{the applicability of}} cubesat spacecraft into lightweight, low cost missions beyond Low Earth Orbit. A conceptual design was done for a 6 -U cubesat for a technology demonstration to demonstrate use of electric propulsion systems on a small satellite platform. The candidate objective was a mission to be launched on the SLS test launch EM- 1 to visit a Near-Earth asteroid. Both asteroid fly-by and asteroid rendezvous missions were analyzed. Propulsion systems analyzed included cold-gas thruster systems, Hall and ion thrusters, incorporating either Xenon or Iodine propellant, and an electrospray thruster. The mission {{takes advantage of the}} ability of the SLS launch to place it into an initial trajectory of C 3 = 0. Targeting asteroids that fly close to earth minimizes the propulsion required for fly-by/rendezvous. Due to mass constraints, high specific impulse is required, and volume constraints mean the propellant density was also of great importance to the ability to achieve the required deltaV. This improves the relative usefulness of the electrospray salt, with higher propellant density. In order to minimize high pressure tanks and volatiles, the salt electrospray and iodine ion propulsion systems were the optimum designs for the fly-by and rendezvous missions respectively combined with a thruster <b>gimbal</b> and <b>wheel</b> system For the candidate fly-by mission, with a mission deltaV of about 400 m/s, the mission objectives could be accomplished with a 800 s electrospray propulsion system, incorporating a propellant-less cathode and a bellows salt tank. This propulsion system is planned for demonstration on 2015 LEO and 2016 GEO DARPA flights. For the rendezvous mission, at a V of 2000 m/s, the mission could be accomplished with a 50 W miniature ion propulsion system running iodine propellant. This propulsion system is not yet demonstrated in space. The conceptual design shows that an asteroid mission is possible using a cubesat platform with high-efficiency electric propulsion...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the first known}} energy storage and attitude control subsystem (ESACS) for small satellites, proving this technology to be viable, applicable to more complex, demanding space missions, and laden with substantial benefits, such as agile slewing, robust singularity avoidance, increased lifetime, mass savings, and favourable peak power density. In capturing the key features of this novel system, it investigates the design sizing, feasibility, mission utility, experimentation, and performance benefits for using variable-speed control moment gyroscopes (VSCMGs) to store and drain energy while controlling satellite orientation. First, a novel optimal ESACS sizing algorithm is developed for a practical, miniature spotlight synthetic aperture RADAR (SAR) space mission. When given a set of small satellite agility and energy storage requirements, the design is cast as a constrained nonlinear programming problem using a performance index constructed from subsystem design margins including the attitude torque, peak power, energy capacity, and subsystem mass margins and solved using a reduced-order, gradient-based solver software code. The resulting method permits an efficient, structured approach to designing an optimally sized ESACS while enabling comparison of new technology performance to an existing system {{in order to identify}} {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such new technology. The process shown generates point designs which are then compared via a design scoring process. Then, realistic usable energy capacity is studied, yielding a more practical system capable of meeting the desired requirements albeit with reduced mass savings benefits from theoretical levels. This factor, although presented in the early 1970 s, is often overlooked in the literature. Next, a novel ESACS gimbal steering law is derived to permit independent <b>gimbal</b> and <b>wheel</b> control of VSCMGs with continued singularity avoidance, a situation that allows direct incorporation of an ESACS into an existing small satellite energy storage (ES) subsystem. This law rejects the disturbances generated during independent ES wheel control which can be significant if the power is stored and drained rapidly, demanding high wheel deceleration/acceleration. Meanwhile, the separation of control renders simultaneous control law singularity avoidance through coordinated <b>wheel</b> torquing and <b>gimballing</b> impossible, thus a conventional CMC gimbal singularity avoidance steering algorithm was also added to this new law. As it permits directly interfacing this small satellite ESACS into a conventional satellite, this novel, composite gimbal steering law is more immediately practical than pre-existing simultaneous steering laws. Finally, a low-cost prototype using current off-the-shelf technology was effectively employed in the first known hardware-in-the-loop, three-axis, experimental demonstration of an ESACS. This is also the first known demonstration of VSCMGs for a small spacecraft scale ESACS. Key test results taken at moderate, less efficient wheel speeds show that a small ESACS can yield the depth-of-discharge and round-trip energy efficiencies near anticipated theoretical values while imparting attitude change, but has limitations in energy density due to the use of COTS motors. It is also shown that a resistive load can be powered from the flywheel system for a set time period (depending upon the resistive load), but drains energy much faster than a magnetically-levitated system would due to motor bearing friction. Nevertheless, these developments open the door for further practical advancement of these concepts and future employment on a small satellite...|$|R
40|$|The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) is {{the first}} of the next {{generation}} geostationary weather satellites, scheduled for delivery in late 2015 and launch in early 2016. Relative to the current generation of GOES satellites, GOES-R represents a dramatic increase in Earth and solar weather observation capabilities, with 4 times the resolution, 5 times the observation rate, and 3 times the number of spectral bands for Earth observations. GOES-R will also provide unprecedented availability, with less than 120 minutes per year of lost observation time. The Guidance Navigation & Control (GN&C) design requirements to achieve these expanded capabilities are extremely demanding. This paper first presents the pointing control, pointing stability, attitude knowledge, and orbit knowledge requirements necessary to realize the ambitious Image Navigation and Registration (INR) objectives of GOES-R. Because the GOES-R suite of instruments is sensitive to disturbances over a broad spectral range, a high fidelity simulation of the vehicle has been created with modal content over 500 Hz to assess the pointing stability requirements. Simulation results are presented showing acceleration, shock response spectrum (SRS), and line of sight responses for various disturbances from 0 Hz to 512 Hz. These disturbances include <b>gimbal</b> motion, reaction <b>wheel</b> disturbances, thruster firings for station keeping and momentum management, and internal instrument disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate excellent performance relative to the pointing and pointing stability requirements, with line of sight jitter of the isolated instrument platform of approximately 1 micro-rad. Low frequency motion of the isolated instrument platform is internally compensated within the primary instrument. Attitude knowledge and rate are provided directly to the instrument with an accuracy defined by the Integrated Rate Error (IRE) requirements. The allowable IRE ranges from 1 to 18. 5 micro-rad, depending upon the time window of interest. The final piece of the INR performance is orbit knowledge. Extremely accurate orbital position is achieved by GPS navigation at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO). Performance results are shown demonstrating compliance with the 50 to 75 m orbit position accuracy requirements of GOES-R, including during station-keeping and momentum management maneuvers. As shown in this paper, the GN&C performance for the GOES-R series of spacecraft supports the challenging mission objectives of the next generation GEO Earth-observation satellites...|$|R
