40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{years of}} moose hair {{analyses}} indicated low copper status in a subpopulation of Alaskan moose (Alces alces gtgos) from the Kenai Pensinsula of south-central Alaska. To confirm these findings {{and to determine}} if these animals had a copper deficiency, further studies were conducted that involved both animal and plant parameters. Ceruloplasmin and blood copper levels were markedly lower than domestic ruminant norms and demonstrated seasonal peaking. Browse plants were marginally sufficient in copper content with an overall mean of 5. 72 ppm. Clinical signs of copper deficiency were noted in the Kenai Peninsula moose sub-population: 1) a <b>faulty</b> <b>hoof</b> keratinization, and 2) a decrease in repro ductive rates. Faulty keratinization was linked with copper deficiency by both mineral element analyses and photoelectron spectroscopy. Decreased copper and sulfur hoof content and an abnormal electron spectroscopy chemical analysis (ESCA) spectra indicated incomplete sulfur cross-link ing in the hoof keratin. The decreased reproductive rates, actual pregnanc...|$|E
