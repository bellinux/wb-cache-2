5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> appears to be a fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

25|$|The {{first series}} of rand {{banknotes}} {{was introduced in}} 1961 in denominations of 1, 2, 10, and 20 rand, with similar designs and colours to the preceding pound notes to ease the transition. They bore the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was believed {{at the time to}} be Jan van Riebeeck, the first V.O.C. administrator of Cape Town. It was later discovered that the image was not in fact Van Riebeeck at all. Like the last pound notes, they were printed in two variants, one with English written first and the other with Afrikaans written first. This practice was continued in the 1966 series which included the first 5-rand notes, but did not include the 20-rand denomination.|$|E
25|$|The Smart Way Reading and Spelling {{program is}} {{presented}} {{in a series of}} twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text {{on one side of the}} flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.|$|E

25|$|With {{a common}} enemy, Guerrero began {{accompanying}} LayCool, interfering in their matches and favoring them in scripted booking decisions such as making herself the referee in McCool's Women's Championship rematch with James where {{she brought the}} title back to McCool. With James out of the picture, their lingering rivalry with Phoenix flared up when Phoenix saved Tiffany from a LayCool beatdown on March 12. The following week, Tiffany and Phoenix defeated LayCool in a standard tag match. This led to a 10 Diva Tag Team match at WrestleMania XXVI which LayCool helped win after Guerrero pinned Kelly Kelly with a Frog Splash. Phoenix gained revenge by defeating them again alongside Tiffany. On WWE Superstars, LayCool and Guerrero cut a promo in which they mocked Phoenix for not fitting their <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a Diva should be, and Guerrero placed Phoenix in an 'intergender' match against Layla, which Phoenix won, despite heavy interfering from McCool and Guerrero. LayCool later gained a measure of revenge by defeating Phoenix and a briefly returned James, after which they taunted Phoenix's perceived bad looks by smothering her in make-up. At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, McCool defended her Women's Championship against Phoenix in an Extreme Makeover match, where cosmetics products were legal as weapons. Phoenix won the title from McCool despite support from Layla and Guerrero.|$|E
500|$|The team {{originally}} {{wanted to}} record the game in six languages, but found the volume of work too difficult, reverting to English and Japanese instead. Before selecting voice actors, Miyoshi designed the characters and built up a mental <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like. Sonic Team hired several voice actors who had appeared in American television programmes.

500|$|When Masashi Kishimoto was {{originally}} creating the Naruto series, {{he looked to}} other shōnen manga for inspiration while still attempting to make his characters as unique as possible. Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series as one of these influences, noting that Goku, the protagonist of Dragon Ball, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality. To complement Naruto, Kishimoto worked on creating a rival that was a [...] "cool genius", as he believed this was [...] "the archetypal rival character". After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed Sasuke Uchiha. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, [...] "I don't have a definite <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a heroine should be". He eventually created Sakura Haruno, emphasizing [...] "her energy and flirtatious spirit" [...] as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main Naruto teams.|$|E
500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it is to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing your idea of what it is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditionally the Upper Ward {{was judged}} to be [...] "to all intents and {{purposes}} a nineteenth-century creation... the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be", {{as a result of the}} extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV. The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow Bath stone. The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for galletting, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century. Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling.|$|E
