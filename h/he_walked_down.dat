25|$|Father Ignatius' health {{had always}} been {{precarious}} at best and worn out with continual work, preaching and begging he {{suffered a heart attack}} and died alone in a ditch (the death he had often described as ideal for himself) on 1 October 1864. Fr. Ignatius was returning from giving a mission in Scotland at the end of September 1864. He stopped at Carstairs to visit an old friend. Leaving his luggage at the station, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the road through the countryside towards the house, and collapsed and died.|$|E
25|$|During 1968, Collins {{noticed that}} his legs were not working as they should, first during {{handball}} games, then as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and the diagnosis was a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae to be fused together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E
500|$|As related above, {{during the}} early 1860s, Irataba befriended prospectors as a guide. One of them was John Moss, whom Irataba had shown the {{location}} of a gold mine in the Mojave desert, which Moss later sold. Moss suggested Irataba be invited to Washington so that he could see firsthand the United States' military might. In November 1863, Irataba traveled with Moss to San Pedro, Los Angeles, where they boarded the steamship Senator, bound for San Francisco. In San Francisco, he stayed at the Occidental Hotel and created a storm as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> Jackson Street, dressed in clothing typical of European Americans, which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing. The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features. On December 2, 1863, the Daily Evening Bulletin described Irataba as a large man, [...] "granitic in appearance as one of the Lower Coast mountains, with... a lower jaw massive enough to crush nuts or crush quartz." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Jean, Jackson {{would not}} {{commit to the}} episode until after a {{read-through}} of the script was done. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that [...] "no one said a word, we just sat there waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit, and his singing voice would be performed by a sound-alike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. Lennon recorded his lines {{at the same time}} as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma has stated the Lennon versions were used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, which is heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member Hank Azaria. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] in his Michael Jackson voice as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the road, but it was changed to him singing the beginning of [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa".|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 2007, two Portland-area climbers were {{ascending}} {{a technical}} {{approach to the}} Pearly Gates at early afternoon when one slid {{to the edge of}} the Bergschrund and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance. [...] His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place. [...] Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down. [...] The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the Bergschrund. [...] <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline snowcat at the top of the ski area.|$|E
2500|$|At age 25, Goodfellow {{opened an}} {{office on the}} second floor of the Crystal Palace Saloon, one of the most luxurious saloons in the West. It was also the {{location}} of offices for other notable officials including County Coroner Dr. H. M. Mathews, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, attorney George W. Berry, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, and Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer. When he wasn't busy tending to patients, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the outside stairs to the saloon below, where he spent many hours drinking, playing Faro, [...] and betting on horse races, foot races, wrestling and boxing matches. He got along well with the hardscrabble miners, the elite of Tombstone, and characters like the notoriously drunk lawyer Allen English.|$|E

2500|$|Later, in Portland, Oregon, Betty (George's wife) told Dean Higinbotham, {{the nephew}} of Betty's sister, Evangeline [...] "Eva", how George got the name Gorgeous George. In the early 1940s George had a wrestling match at the Portland Oregon Armory. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle to the ring, there were two mature women on his right, two rows back from the ring. One of the women loudly exclaimed, [...] "Oh, isn't he gorgeous." [...] That word [...] "gorgeous" [...] struck George and he {{immediately}} felt he had found his new professional persona. [...] He would be [...] "Gorgeous George". [...] As Elsie Hanson, Betty's mother, was a skilled seamstress, George asked her to make him some resplendent capes that would accentuate his new persona. [...] George wore those capes in all his future matches.|$|E
2500|$|In early August 2005, Cook and his wife, Gaynor, took {{a two-week}} holiday in the Highlands of Scotland. At around 2:20pm on 6 August 2005, while <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> Ben Stack in Sutherland, Cook {{suddenly}} suffered a severe heart attack, collapsed, lost consciousness and fell about [...] down a ridge. He was assisted after his fall by another hill-walker who refused all publicity and was granted anonymity. A helicopter containing paramedics arrived 30 minutes after a 999 call was made. [...] Cook then was flown to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. Gaynor {{did not get}} in the helicopter, {{and walked down the}} mountain. Despite efforts made by the medical team to revive Cook in the helicopter, he was already beyond recovery, and at 4:05pm, minutes after arrival at the hospital, was pronounced dead. Two days later, a post mortem examination found that Cook had died of hypertensive heart disease.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the train}} {{approached}} the Merillon Avenue station, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the ground, stood up, {{and opened fire}} at random. During the next three minutes, Ferguson killed six people and injured another 19. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, [...] "He's got a gun! He's shooting people!" [...] Ferguson walked east on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to {{the eastern end of}} the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. The New York Times later wrote the motions were [...] "as methodical as if he were taking tickets". Ferguson said, [...] "I'm going to get you," [...] over and over as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle.|$|E

2500|$|A {{criminal}} investigation also began {{weeks after the}} shooting, when the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) forwarded {{the case to the}} state's attorney's office and the FBI. The U.S. attorney's office confirmed on April 13, 2015, that they had been conducting a federal {{criminal investigation}} of the McDonald case in conjunction with the state attorney's office, after contradictions were found between the initial police report and the dash-cam video. The police report said that McDonald had lunged at an officer, but the video footage showed that McDonald made no lunges. [...] The video does show that McDonald was swinging the knife in his right hand in a wide, but aimless manner as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the street, and also appears to show that McDonald turns slightly to look briefly at Van Dyke and another officer who are pointing guns at him, but that he continues to walk away from both officers at the moment Van Dyke opens fire on him.|$|E
2500|$|Hookes {{played for}} the West Torrens Cricket Club and made his A-Grade debut {{at the age of}} just 15. When he came in to bat he faced Adelaide Cricket Club bowler and local Australian rules {{football}} and media personality Ken [...] "KG" [...] Cunningham. KG said later in a Channel 9 tribute to Hookes that after the first two balls went past the edge of the bat, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the wicket and attempted to upset the youngster in his first game and [...] "gave him a huge spray". Hookes then sent the next four balls to the fence and after the over walked up to Cunningham and said: [...] "Listen old man, if you continue to bowl those wobbly little inswingers the next four will go over the fence and not into the fence." [...] In later years KG became one of Hookes's close friends and on Adelaide television and radio one of his strongest supporters even after his move to Melbourne to become coach of the Victorian state side.|$|E
2500|$|In early August 1944, Hitler ordered Field Marshal Günther von Kluge {{to launch}} Operation Lüttich against the Americans, {{and as the}} Resistance had severed the {{telephone}} lines, the orders for Lüttich were transmitted via the radio in a code that had been broken by the Government Code and Cypher School, leading to Ultra intelligence that gave the Americans advanced notice and {{time to prepare for}} the coming offensive. After the breakout from Normandy, Eisenhower had planned to by-pass Paris while Hitler had ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz to destroy Paris rather allowing the city be liberated, stating [...] "Paris must be destroyed from top to bottom, before the Wehrmacht leaves, do not leave a church or cultural monument standing". The FFI in Paris led by Alexandre Parodi and Jacques Chaban-Delmas urged patience while Henri Tanguy (codename Colonel Rol), the FTP chief in Paris wanted to start a revolt, being deterred only {{by the fact that the}} Resistance in Paris had about 15,000 men, but only 600 guns, mostly rifles and machine guns. On 19 August 1944, the Paris police, until then still loyal to Vichy, went over to the Resistance as a group of policemen hosted the tricolore over the Préfecture de Police on the Ile de la Cité, which was the first time the tricolor had flown in Paris since June 1940. All over Paris, the outlawed tricolore started to fly over schools, mairies and police stations, an open challenge to German power, and a sign that the French civil service was shifting its loyalty. Emboldened, Tanguy and his men started to attack German forces on the Boulevard Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Germain, leading to a mass insurrection as Parisians started to build barricades in the streets. By the end of the day, about 50 Germans and 150 résistants had been killed and not wanting the Communists to have the credit for liberating Paris, the Gaullist Parodi sanctioned the uprising. Faced with an urban uprising that he was unprepared for, Choltitz arranged a truce with Parodi via the Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, marking the first time that the Germans had treated the resistance as a legitimate opponent. On 21 August 1944, Koenig was given command of all the BCRA agents, the SOE's F section and RF section agents and the Jedburgh teams, which reflected the political need to put all of the resistance under French control. By the end of August 1944, the SOE had a total of 53 radio stations operating in France, up from the two it had begun with in May 1941. De Gaulle disapproved of the truce as he used the uprising to order on 22 August General Jacques Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division to liberate Paris, stating he did not want the Communists to liberate the city. On 24 August, French soldiers entered Paris, which led to some hours of intense fighting before Choltiz surrendered on 25 August, through pockets of German and milice forces fought on for several more days as Choltiz simply did not inform his forces of his plans to surrender. On the afternoon of August 25, 1944 de Gaulle returned to Paris, a city he not set foot in since June 1940, to be greeted by vast cheering crowds as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the Champs de Elysee.|$|E
