The incorporation of deuterium slows the rate of drug metabolism, allowing less frequent dosing. [...] In May, 2017, published data showed deutetrabenazine effective in tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Stable isotope tracers {{are used}} to assess {{metabolic}} flux profiles in living cells. The existing methods of measurement average out the <b>isotopic</b> <b>isomer</b> distribution in metabolites throughout the cell, whereas the knowledge of compartmental organization of analyzed pathways is crucial {{for the evaluation of}} true fluxes. That is why we accepted a challenge to create a software tool that allows deciphering the compartmentation of metabolites based on the analysis of average <b>isotopic</b> <b>isomer</b> distribution. Results The software Isodyn, which simulates the dynamics of <b>isotopic</b> <b>isomer</b> distribution in central metabolic pathways, was supplemented by algorithms facilitating the transition between various analyzed metabolic schemes, and by the tools for model discrimination. It simulated 13 C isotope distributions in glucose, lactate, glutamate and glycogen, measured by mass spectrometry after incubation of hepatocytes in the presence of only labeled glucose or glucose and lactate together (with label either in glucose or lactate). The simulations assumed either a single intracellular hexose phosphate pool, or also channeling of hexose phosphates resulting in a different isotopic composition of glycogen. Model discrimination test was applied to check the consistency of both models with experimental data. Metabolic flux profiles, evaluated with the accepted model that assumes channeling, revealed the range of changes in metabolic fluxes in liver cells. Conclusions The analysis of compartmentation of metabolic networks based on the measured 13 C distribution was included in Isodyn as a routine procedure. The advantage of this implementation is that, being a part of evaluation of metabolic fluxes, it does not require additional experiments to study metabolic compartmentation. The analysis of experimental data revealed that the distribution of measured 13 C-labeled glucose metabolites is inconsistent with the idea of perfect mixing of hexose phosphates in cytosol. In contrast, the observed distribution indicates the presence of a separate pool of hexose phosphates that is channeled towards glycogen synthesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Metabolic flux {{profiling}} {{based on}} the analysis of distribution of stable isotope tracer in metabolites is an important method widely used in cancer research to understand the regulation of cell metabolism and elaborate new therapeutic strategies. Recently, we developed software Isodyn, which extends the methodology of kinetic modeling {{to the analysis of}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>isomer</b> distribution for the evaluation of cellular metabolic flux profile under relevant conditions. This tool can be applied to reveal the metabolic effect of proapoptotic drug edelfosine in leukemia Jurkat cell line, uncovering the mechanisms of induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Results The study of 13 C distribution of Jukat cells exposed to low edelfosine concentration, which induces apoptosis in &# 8804; 5 % of cells, revealed metabolic changes previous to the development of apoptotic program. Specifically, it was found that low dose of edelfosine stimulates the TCA cycle. These metabolic perturbations were coupled with an increase of nucleic acid synthesis de novo, which indicates acceleration of biosynthetic and reparative processes. The further increase of the TCA cycle fluxes, when higher doses of drug applied, eventually enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and trigger apoptotic program. Conclusion The application of Isodyn to the analysis of mechanism of edelfosine-induced apoptosis revealed primary drug-induced metabolic changes, which are important for the subsequent initiation of apoptotic program. Initiation of such metabolic changes could be exploited in anticancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia {{in solid}} tumours is {{associated}} with the promotion of various metabolic mechanisms and induces resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography by use of selective biomarkers has emerged as valuable tools for the detection of hypoxic areas within tumours so treatment can be modified accordingly. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate [(18) F] 3 -NTR, a 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazole analogue (N(1) substituted) of [(18) F]FMISO as a potential hypoxia selective tracer. 3 -NTR and its (18) F-radiolabelled <b>isotopic</b> <b>isomer</b> were synthesised and compared with FMISO in vitro and in vivo. Their physicochemical properties were measured, the enzymatic reduction was evaluated, and the reactivity of their metabolites was investigated. Biodistribution and PET scans were performed on CBA mice bearing hypoxic CaNT tumour cells, using (18) F-labelled versions of the tracers. [(18) F] 3 -NTR uptake within hypoxic cells was lower than [(18) F]FMISO and [(18) F] 3 -NTR did not exhibit any better selectivity than FMISO as a PET tracer in vivo. Both (18) F-radiolabelled compounds are relatively evenly distributed within the whole body and the radioactive uptake within hypoxic tumours reaches a maximum at 30 min post injection and decreases thereafter. Xanthine oxidase exhibited a nitroreductase activity toward 3 -NTR under anaerobic conditions, but reduced metabolites did not bind covalently. It is confirmed that 3 -NTR is an electron acceptor. It is postulated that radiolabelled metabolites and fragments of [(18) F] 3 -NTR are freely diffusing due to their poor binding capacities. Thus [(18) F] 3 -NTR cannot be used as a hypoxia selective tracer for PET. The investigation provides insights into the importance of the propensity to form covalent adducts for such biomarkers...|$|E
