Today, besides being of academic interest, these solutions are useful for verifying finite element analysis results, performing parametric studies, or assisting with preliminary designs. Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger (1959) presented solutions for sectorial plates <b>fixed</b> (<b>clamped)</b> along the circular boundary and simply supported along the (straight) radial edges. However, they acknowledged that sectorial plate solutions containing clamped or free radial edges must be solved using approximate methods.

40|$|Abstract. CANMET-MTL has {{developed}} a low-constraint test designed to reduce unnecessary conservatism in the measurement of toughness {{for use in the}} assessment of flaws in pipeline girth welds. The design is based on tension loading using <b>fixed</b> (<b>clamped)</b> grips of a single-edge-notched BxB SE(T) specimen, side-grooved to promote plane-strain conditions. Equations have been developed to derive J-integral, CTOD and crack growth from measurement of load and crack-mouth opening displacement.

40|$|Finite element (FE) {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} become a popular tool for exploring welding and clamping sequence dependence in sheet metal assemblies. In the current paper, the dimensional variability associated with different assembly clamping sequences is investigated with a FE contact modelling approach implemented in the commercial code Abaqus. A simplified channel section assembly consisting of a top hat and bottom plate is the case study investigated. Expected variation modes of bow and twist were used to simulate key variability sources in the main structural component under investigation; the top hat of the channel section. It was found that final assembly variability can change considerably depending on clamp sequence selection. It was also found that different clamp sequences can control particular modes of variation better than others, {{and that there is}} not one particular clamping sequence that is the best for containing all variation modes. An adaptable assembly process is therefore suggested, where given the shape of input components the best available clamping sequence is selected. Comparison of the performance of the proposed adaptable clamping sequence to traditional <b>fixed</b> <b>clamping</b> sequences shows improvements for the dimensional control of variability in non-rigid components. While introducing such a method in production would require inspection of each component being assembled and investigation of the alternative clamping sequences, given access to fast and detailed dimensional inspection technology such as optical coordinate measuring machines (OCMM 2 ̆ 7 s), the approach shows promise for future application. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In general, Electrostatic chuck (ESC) {{was used}} to <b>fix</b> and <b>clamp</b> the silicon wafer with {{electrostatic}} force in the semiconductor fabrication process. Recently, due to their excellent chemical and plasma stability and high thermal conductivity, sintered ceramics {{has been used as}} an insulator material in the configuration of ESC. However, metals of high melting point, such as Mo, W, still used for electrode materials. Because of the thermal mismatch between metal electrode and ceramic insulator, micro cracks were produced at the interface during sintering process of ceramic or its operation process with high temperature, which leads to reduce the life time of ESC. To improve the compatibility between metal and ceramic, mesh type metal electrode was used in ESC but this type of electrode results in inhomogeneous electrostatic force. Homogeneous clamping force is very important to determine the final quality of semiconductor. We have investigated a ceramic electrostatic chuck composed of conducting ceramic electrode of titanium nitride instead of metal electrode. Aluminum nitride was added to titanium nitride to control the thermal expansion coefficient. This composite electrode shows not only a good electrical conductivity but also an excellent compatibility to dielectric layer. Compatibility between the electrode and dielectric layer enable to design the electrode with continuous sheet type which leads to homogeneous electrostatic force. Electrostatic force of ceramic ESC with conducting ceramic electrode was about 1700 gf/ 4 inch wafer when the applied voltage was DC 3 kV...|$|R
40|$|Pinned element {{connections}} in aluminium trusses are investigated experimentally [2]. Forces in the connections are transferred through shear and bearing. Because the inner cylinder and the securing pins are conical, {{there is no}} play in the connection when it is assembled. Securing the pins with springs allows for fast assembly and disassembly. In practice also nuts are used for securing the pins. The parameters investigated in the research are the boundary conditions (hinged or <b>fixed</b> in <b>clamps</b> of the test bench) {{and the way the}} pins are secured (with springs or with nuts). The mean maximum load at structural failure is 136 kN. This load was not influenced by the parameters investigated. The maximum elongation at structural failure is influenced by the way the pins are secured. The use of nuts (series II) results in more elongation (sample mean 14. 7 mm) compared to the use of springs (series I, sample mean 13. 1 mm). The load at maximum elastic deformation is influenced by the boundary conditions in the test bench. The clamped specimens show a mean elastic load limit of 39. 7 kN, which is approximately 12 kN lower than the hinged specimens which show a mean elastic load limit of 51. 4 kN. This {{can be explained by the}} additional stresses in the fixed connections resulting from the prevention of rotations, leading to a lower limit for elastic loading. The elastic connection stiffness is dependent on the way the pins are secured.

First the veins are marked with the patient in standing position. Then the patient is positioned on the operating table and local anesthesia is applied. Incisions are made using a surgical blade. The most important instrument for this technique is the vein retractor or phlebectomy hook. There are two ways by which the veins can be grasped.
