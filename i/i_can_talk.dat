500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E
500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E
2500|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} great review, saying [...] "I mean. How am I {{supposed}} to discuss Once's two-hour finale -- an epic, fantastical take on Back to the Future complete with far-off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, and a princess in disguise -- when all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about, all I can think about, is that final shot, which may just be the most surprising {{moment in the history}} of OUAT?" ...|$|E

I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was sitting right beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But few of {{the women}} <b>I</b> know <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about any thing but servants, dress, and gossip. Here and there one knows {{something}} of music, art, or literature; but the superior ones are not favorites with the larger class of gentlemen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, Cap'n Kittridge! <b>I</b> {{wonder you}} <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> so," [...] said his wife. [...] "It's an awful responsibility, and I wonder you don't think whether or no you're fit for it." ...|$|R

60|$|August 18.--Again I fell a half page behind, being summoned out {{too early}} for my task, but I am still two leaves before on the whole week.
