5000|$|In new {{observatory}} designs, <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounts</b> {{have been}} out of favor for decades in large-scale professional applications. Massive new instruments are most stable when mounted in an alt-azimuth (up down, side-to-side) configuration.

At the amateur level, however, <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounts</b> remain popular, particularly for astrophotography.|$|R
50|$|The {{telescope}} had a 48 in speculum primary mirror, and {{was mounted}} on an <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting,</b> enabling it {{to track the}} stars accurately as they appeared to move across the sky. The design had been approved by a committee of leading British astronomers and scientists.At the time of commissioning {{it was the second}} largest telescope operating in the world, after Lord Rosse’s 6 foot reflector at Birr, Ireland, and it was the largest fully steerable telescope in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{telescope}} {{itself has}} great historical significance; at 48 {{in it was}} the largest fully steerable telescope in the world when it was built in 1869, {{and it was the first}} telescope that large to be placed on an <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting,</b> enabling it to track the stars accurately as they appeared to move across the sky. It was [...] "hailed as a masterpiece of engineering", requiring only one assistant to control its movement.

50|$|The La Palma INT is a Cassegrain telescope, with a 2.54 m (100 in) {{diameter}} {{primary mirror}} and a focal length of 8.36 m (329 in). The mirror weighs 4361 kg (9614 lb), and {{is supported by}} a polar disc/fork type <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting.</b> The total weight of the telescope is around 90 tons. The f/3.29 Prime focus, used with the WFC, allows an unvignetted field of view of 40 arcminutes (approximately 0.3 square degrees). There is also a secondary focal station, the f/15 Cassegrain focus, which possesses a 20 arcminute field of view and is the mount point for the IDS. The telescopes second first light was done by video.|$|E
50|$|With the {{invention}} of the telescope, it became possible for astronomers to observe celestial objects in greater detail, provided that the telescope could be kept pointed at the object for a period of time. The easiest {{way to do that is}} to use an <b>equatorial</b> <b>mount,</b> which allows the telescope to be aligned with one of its two pivots parallel to the Earth's axis. A motorized clock drive often is used with an <b>equatorial</b> <b>mount</b> to cancel out the Earth's rotation. As the <b>equatorial</b> <b>mount</b> became widely adopted for observation, the equatorial coordinate system, which includes right ascension, was adopted at the same time for simplicity. <b>Equatorial</b> <b>mounts</b> could then be accurately pointed at objects with known right ascension and declination by the use of setting circles. The first star catalog to use right ascension and declination was John Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica (1712, 1725).|$|R

In 1831 Cooper acquired from Robert A. Cauchoix of Paris an objective of 13.5-inches (35.5 cm) for which he paid £1200. In 1834 he mounted the lens on an <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting</b> supplied by Thomas Grubb of Dublin. For a number of years Cooper’s big refractor was the largest in the world. He used the telescope to sketch Halley's comet in 1835 and to view the solar eclipse of 15 May 1836.|$|E
50|$|The Doridis {{telescope}} {{was built in}} 1902 and remained as the largest telescope of Greece for 57 years. The telescope is named after the benefactor Dimitrios Doridis (Greek:Δημήτριος Δωρίδης), who financed its construction. It is a refractor with double achromatic lenses of 40 cm diameter and has 5m focal length. Its tube is mounted on a so-called German-type <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting</b> and it is housed in a new dome {{not far from the}} Sinas building. The Doridis refractor was extensively used for observations of planets, comets, and the moon, as well as for astrometry and photometry of variable stars. In 2014, thanks to a generous donation from Cosmote, the {{telescope was}} fully restored and it is used for the purposes of education and public outreach.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{telescope}} in the dome room of Fuertes was a 4.5-inch refractor telescope {{used in some}} of Cornell's previous observatories, and was mounted on an equatorial clock-driven mount. Soon after, in 1919, Civil Engineering Professor Irving Porter Church acquired two glass blanks from the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. The glass blanks were ground and polished into a 12-inch achromatic lens by Brashear & Co in 1920. Professor Church spearheaded a campaign to raise money from civil engineering alumni to build the telescope and <b>equatorial</b> <b>mounting.</b> In January 1922, the order was placed with the Warner & Swasey Company to build the equatorial mount. After modifications {{were made to the}} original dome, the telescope was installed during the summer and fall of 1922, and was completed on October 16, 1922. It was officially dedicated on June 15, 1923 as the “Irving Porter Church Memorial Telescope.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: I {{investigate}} the computing costs of imaging for an SD+FPA telescope {{such as the}} xNTD or KAT by conducting simulations of continuum and spectral line imaging.

With Moore’s Law and possible algorithmic improvements, a plausible hardware cost lies in the range A$ 2 M to A$ 4 M (2009). <b>Equatorial</b> <b>mounts</b> are cost effective in controlling computing costs since with current algorithms the processing for alt-azimuth {{is at least a}} factor of 3 – 4 more expensive.
