6000|$|... "Oh, I {{decided on}} the title long ago. I call it AVERIL'S ATONEMENT. Doesn't that sound nice and alliterative? Now, Diana, tell me candidly, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> faults in my story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sending {{back one}} of the horses, Karl, and asking the count {{to take care of}} it for me, until I return or send for it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{difference}} between them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] ejaculated her father, as if {{convinced}} of the uselessness of trying to understand a woman. [...] "Say, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> strange horse tracks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely.--Take care of it, Jessie," [...] said Stanley, {{throwing}} {{it to his}} wife; [...] "it may be explained some day.--Well, Massan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other animals?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's {{better to}} be pretty. Cleverness is open to any one {{who is willing to}} study. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> girl as nice-looking as I am while you were in Canada?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jon," [...] {{said his}} father to his mother, under the oak tree, [...] "is terrible. I'm afraid he's {{going to turn out}} a sailor, or {{something}} hopeless. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> sign of his appreciating beauty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cancer again, like Julia! I {{never knew}} there was cancer in our family. Oh, my good God, our poor Anna, after the life she'd had!--What, lad, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> God {{at the back of}} that?--I'm damned if I do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "There's Hairy. Did {{you ever}} see two cousins look more alike? If it were not that Hairy is bigger than Downy {{it would be hard}} work to tell them apart. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> other difference, Peter?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{regiment}} {{was sent}} to the eastward, as you know, and having just received my new rank of major, it would not do to be absent at the moment. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> one here, besides those who belong to the manor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{the doctor}} is there,' she proceeded. 'That will be well. Ask him everything, Maurice. But oh! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> one so much altered as poor Fred! He looks twenty years older! Ah! I am quite good now! I may go now!' she cried, as the door opened.|$|R

5000|$|... "People {{always ask}} me to explain about the book. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> when Gene Krupa did his book, he had a rudimental drummer {{collaborate}} with him. But Gene didn't play that way. In Buddy's book, we actually teach the way he <b>does</b> things. If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> {{of the kids who}} used Buddy's book correctly, you'll see that they play the same way, technically," [...] Adler said.|$|R

If {{these were}} the only bands of this colour, then these two Logicians ought to have left at the first bell. Since they did not, {{that can only be}} because your own band is the same colour, so you can leave at the second bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me suggest, then," [...] I continued, [...] "that {{you should}} see Anne Catherick yourself, and do all you can to win her confidence. For my own part, I shrink {{from the idea of}} {{alarming}} the poor creature a second time, as I have most unhappily alarmed her already. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> objection to accompanying me to the farmhouse to-morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How am I {{to get my}} {{opportunity}} of speaking to Mr. Gracedieu? I mustn't call on him again as soon as to-morrow or next day. But I might meet him, out walking alone, if you will {{tell me how to}} do it. A note to my hotel is all I want. Don't tremble, my sweet.

6000|$|... "Hallo, Tommy, old hero, {{here you}} are! What {{is it to}} be? What will you have? I'm taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water. Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I'm the same.

Dear God, how old we're getting! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> signs of aging in me--eh, what? A little grey and thin on the top--what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith Meredith {{has really}} {{got to be the}} most handsomest {{creature}} I ever saw," [...] commented Miss Cornelia above her filet crochet. [...] "It's amazing how those children came on after Rosemary West went to the manse. People have almost forgotten what imps of mischief they were once. Anne, dearie, will you ever forget {{the way they used to}} carry on? It's really surprising how well Rosemary got on with them. She's more like a chum than a step-mother. They all love her and Una adores her. As for that little Bruce, Una just makes a perfect slave of herself to him. Of course, he is a darling. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> child look as much like an aunt as he looks like his Aunt Ellen? He's just as dark and just as emphatic. I can't see a feature of Rosemary in him. Norman Douglas always vows at the top of his voice that the stork meant Bruce for him and Ellen and took him to the manse by mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Q. Did <b>you</b> ever <b>see</b> the two {{ministers of}} the Begum?--A. I saw [...] them brought into Lucknow.--Q.

6000|$|No! I {{will not}} say one word about apologies or excuses for not writing--I am a poor, rascally gauger, {{condemned}} to gallop at least 200 miles every week to inspect dirty ponds and yeasty barrels, and where can I find time to write to, or importance to interest anybody? The upbraidings of my conscience, nay, the upbraidings of my wife, have persecuted me on your account these {{two or three months}} past. I wish to God I was a great man, that my correspondence might throw light upon you, to let the world <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> really are: and then I would make your fortune, without putting my hand in my pocket for you, which, like all other great men, I suppose I would avoid as much as possible. What are <b>you</b> <b>doing,</b> and how are <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> Have <b>you</b> lately <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of my few friends? What has become of the borough reform, or how is the fate of my poor namesake Mademoiselle Burns decided? O man! but for thee and thy selfish appetites, and dishonest artifices, that beauteous form, and that once innocent and still ingenuous mind, might have shone conspicuous and lovely in the faithful wife, and the affectionate mother; and shall the unfortunate sacrifice to thy pleasures have no claim on thy humanity! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{island in}} the distance," [...] resumed the old man, [...] "is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places--but why it has been thought {{necessary}} to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> change in the water?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'DEAR CYTHEREA--I have {{received}} a frank and friendly letter from Mr. Manston explaining the position in which he stands now, and also that in which he hopes to stand towards you. Can't you love him? Why not? Try, for he is a good, and not only that, but a cultured man.

60|$|One of the bottlenosed {{fraternity}} it was went by {{the name}} of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.|$|E
6000|$|Was not Fiorsen, {{with his}} great talent, and his dubious reputation, proof of that? And he excited her. Whatever else {{one might be}} in his moody, vivid company, one would not be dull. One morning, he told her {{something}} of his life. His {{father had been a}} small Swedish landowner, a very strong man and a very hard drinker; his mother, the daughter of a painter. She had taught him the violin, but died while he was still a boy. When he was seventeen he had quarrelled with his father, and had to play his violin for a living in the streets of Stockholm. A well-known violinist, hearing him one day, took him in hand. Then his father had drunk himself to death, and he had inherited the little estate. He had sold it at once--"for follies," [...] as he put it crudely. [...] "Yes, Miss Winton; I have committed many follies, but they are nothing to those I shall commit the day I <b>do</b> not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> more!" [...] And, with that disturbing remark, he got up and left her. She had smiled at his words, but within herself she felt excitement, scepticism, compassion, and something she did not understand at all. In those days, she understood herself very little.|$|R
60|$|Do not fancy it, I beg you, an {{easy thing}} to judge fairly of facts; even to {{discover}} the facts at all, when they are staring you in the face; and to see what it is that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Any</b> lawyer will tell you, that if you ask three honest men to bear testimony concerning an event which happened but yesterday, none of them, if he be at all an interested party, will give you exactly the same account of it: not that he wishes to say what is untrue; but that different parts of the whole matter having struck each man with different force, a different picture has been left on each man's memory. I have been utterly astounded of late, in investigating these strange stories of table-turning and spirit-rapping, to find how even clear-headed and well-instructed persons (as one had fancied them) become unable to examine fairly into a thing, the moment the desire to believe has entered the heart; and how no amount of mere cultivation, if the scientific habit of mind be wanting, can prevent people from finding (as in table-turning) miracles in the most simple mechanical accidents; or from becoming (as in spirit-rapping) the dupes of the most clumsy, palpable, and degrading impostures, even after they have been exposed {{over and over again in}} print. Humiliating, indeed, it is, in this so self-confident and boastful nineteenth century, amid steam-engines, railroads, electric telegraphs, and all the wonders of our inductive science, to find exploded superstitions leaping back into life even more monstrous and irrational than in past ages, and to see our modern Pharisees and Sadducees, like those in Judea of old, seeking after a sign of an unseen world; and being unable to find one either in the heaven above or in the earth beneath, discovering it at last (I am almost ashamed to speak the words) under the parlour-table.|$|R

"If {{you will}} leave the five years, from 'seventy-six to 'eighty-one, entirely to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "and take the next five years, {{reckoning}} backward from 'seventy-six, you will help me to better purpose. Sir Jervis expects me to look for reports of Central American Explorations, through the newspapers of the last forty years; and I have taken the liberty of limiting the heavy task imposed on me.

6000|$|... "Oh, no! You {{understand}} me very well," [...] she answered. [...] "Everybody {{knows that it}} is you who keep us going. Lumley has not got quite used to taking your money. He has lost nearly all his ambition. Soon his day will have gone by. People shrug their shoulders when they speak of us. Two years ago the Wavertons were delighted to know me. Society seems big, but it isn't. There are no end of little sets, one inside the other. Two years ago, I was in the innermost, today I'm getting towards the outside edge.

6000|$|... "Why don't {{you suppose}} so? What's {{to be the}} end of it all? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> way out of it?--for I do not.

How are we to expect a man like Clayton to come forward and be shot at in that fashion? As far as I can see there will be no possibility for anyone to live in this country again. Of course it's all over with me. I haven't got any rents to speak of, and the only property I possess is now useless." ...|$|E
