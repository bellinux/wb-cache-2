5|$|The {{military}} {{failure in}} the First Bishops' War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain, while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives, led to the public humiliation of the Battle of the Downs, where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet {{off the coast of}} Kent <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the impotent English navy.|$|E

5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E

Continuing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the US border wall. By the time they reach the border, the creatures have crossed into the United States. Andrew and Samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in Texas, find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E
5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately gathered his ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent messages in the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats reasoned that the French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would be too late to catch them. He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} a {{successful}} Vuelta a Burgos in August. Defending champion Sánchez won the first stage, atop , by outkicking Joaquim Rodríguez <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the line as the two finished four seconds {{better than any other}} riders. However, he lost the race lead to Rodríguez when the latter won stage 2 in the city of Burgos. The stage 3 team time trial then dropped Sánchez to fifth overall, before he improved to fourth after stage 4. Landa won stage 5 from a breakaway, his first professional victory. Winning the final climb also gave him enough points to take the race's mountains classification. The squad placed three riders in the top ten, with Sánchez fourth, Antón eighth, and Nieve tenth. Antón rounded out the team's season by winning the climber's prize at the inaugural Tour of Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E
