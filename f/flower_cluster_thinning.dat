40|$|To breed a {{seedless}} grape cultivar that produces large-sized berries with labor saving, 201 triploid hybrid plants were firstly derived from 24 interploid crosses with seven diploid and six tetraploid cultivars. A triploid grape BK 9101 {{derived from a}} ‘Muscat Bailey A’ × ‘Kyoho’ cross was finally selected and given a cultivar name ‘Bea-Kei’. ‘Bea-Kei’ showed high male and female sterility and produced small-sized seedless berries of about 2 g because of its low parthenocarpic ability. One time immersion treatment of the adequately thinned flower clusters with 100 ppm GA 3 at around full bloom, however, resulted {{in the formation of}} large-sized black berries of 8 - 11 g that stuck together. The trees showed high vigor and productivity, and, thus, required summer pruning for vigor control and thinning of flower clusters and flowers for high quality berry production. However, once the <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> was carried out so that the each of the clusters had about 70 flowers, fruit thinning was unnecessary because of ideal fruit set and growth rates after the GA 3 treatment of the thinned flower clusters. The berries ripened from late August to early September in field conditions, and the berry quality did not deteriorate on trees by October. The berries were black-purple in rind color and contained high concentration of soluble solid sugars (19 - 21 % in Brix). The rind of ‘Bea-Kei’ was not so slippery that the seed and pollen parents did. The flesh of ‘Bea-Kei’ was harder than the parents and showed superior taste than the parents. The estimation of the whole data obtained in this research led to the conclusion that ‘Bea-Kei’ has high potential as a new leading triploid cultivar that produces very high quality seedless berries with the aid of GA 3 at full bloom...|$|E
40|$|In {{commercial}} apple production, {{variability in}} yield and fruit quality among trees, orchards and seasons may have significant {{negative impact on}} profitability of individual orchards, and ultimately, the global competitiveness of the national industry. Although the Australian and New Zealand apple industries differ widely in many aspects, they both recognise the need for increased production of high quality fruit in order to expand export markets. In spring, competition among flowers, developing fruit, and shoots for limited resource supply induces fruitlet abscission, reduces potential fruit size, and may negatively affect fruit quality and induce biennial bearing. In commercial apple production, natural flowering and fruit set generally result in crop loads that are too high to achieve premium fruit size and quality targets. Orchardists seek to reduce flower and fruit numbers to their commercial target {{as soon as possible}} in spring. However, current standard technology relies on chemical thinning which does not give reliable or predictable responses. Apart from increasing risk, this leads to delays in achieving final fruit numbers, which results in loss of potential fruit size and quality. The mechanisms regulating flowering, fruit set and abscission in perennial crops such as apple are complicated and not fully understood. Improved knowledge of the physiology of these processes is required if commercial thinning practices are to be improved and consistently high yields of high quality fruit are to be achieved. Artificial spur extinction (ASE) provides a useful tool to investigate the physiology of flowering, fruit set and abscission. ASE is a crop load management tool that uses hand-thinning of whole buds in late dormancy to set targeted floral bud densities consistently on every limb. The process retains buds on spurs and short shoots in well illuminated areas of the canopy and spaces them evenly along the limb. Chemical thinning is not used. In this thesis, removal of floral and vegetative sinks as well as potential leaf area (carbohydrate source) using ASE, provided a means to investigate the role of carbohydrate source-sink relationships in annual flowering and fruit set. The research was conducted on ‘Gala’ strains, in five different commercial production environments through Australia and New Zealand over four seasons. This allowed examination of influence of environment on flowering and fruit set in this genotype. This thesis is presented in six chapters. The first provides background to the investigation, identifies the primary hypotheses tested and gives an outline to the thesis structure. The second to fifth chapters describe specific investigations that were undertaken and discuss the results in the context of current scientific knowledge and commercial technology. The last chapter provides a summary of outcomes, and, with a general discussion of the conclusions arrived at in the investigative research, discusses the relevance of the outcomes of the research to scientific knowledge and commercial technology. In the first research chapter, trees managed using ASE were compared with trees thinned after final fruit drop (Control) on five sites through New Zealand and Australia over four seasons. In Control trees flowering and fruit set was unpredictable and highly variable among trees within sites, among sites, and between seasons. Reducing floral bud density using ASE greatly reduced variability in flowering and fruit set and allowed predictive fruit set models to be developed for each site. Results led to investigations of the role of carbohydrates in fruit set and development during {{the early part of the}} season. These investigations are discussed in the ensuing three research chapters. Using two treatments, ASE and <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> before bloom (FCT), and comparing these treatments with trees in which flower numbers were not altered (Control), allowed investigation of the effects of early sink removal (ASE and FCT vs Control), and altered leaf area and access to stored carbohydrates (ASE vs FCT) on fruit set. The effects of these factors on fruit development were also investigated by ensuring all treatments had the same final crop load, using post fruit drop hand-thinning to set either 4 or 6 fruit per cm 2 branch basal cross-sectional area (BCA). Reduction of floral bud density through FCT or ASE increased within-bud fruit set and led to greater harvest mean fruit weight. These results lead to a hypothesis that these treatments improved carbon availability within floral spurs during early-season development, and that the means by which this occurred differed between ASE and FCT. In FCT, reducing the density of flower clusters (sink size) without altering leaf area may have increased the availability of newly synthesised carbon to remaining sinks, improving fruit set and development. In ASE, removal of, and uniform spatial distribution of remaining buds may have improved irradiance of remaining fruiting spurs, thereby increasing photosynthate availability to the developing fruit within the spurs. These conclusions were examined in investigations on seasonal light interception and the role of stored carbohydrates in ASE canopies, which are discussed in chapters four and five. ASE could be thought likely to reduce total early-season leaf area and light interception, as it greatly reduces total bud numbers on the tree. Fractional light interception was measured on ASE and Unmodified trees from shortly after dormancy, through one whole season. Where ASE was set at bud densities producing commercial crop loads (` 4 and 6 ` `buds` `per` `cm_ 2 ` `BCA`), early season light interception was not affected (6 buds per cm 2 BCA) or only marginally reduced (`- 2...|$|E

30|$|Objectives of the {{research}} program were to study the effect of some environmental and physiological aspects on the intensity of flavonoid synthesis. The {{study was conducted in}} 2011 in Podgorica, Montenegro. Two grapevine cultivars were selected to compare their ability in flavonoid accumulation: autochtonous variety Vranac, with moderate accumulation of flavonoids and Cabernet Sauvignon with good accumulation of polyphenols. The following experimental treatments were compared: early leaf removal (<b>flowering</b> time), <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> (veraison time) and combination of both treatments. The early defoliation reduced the yield per vine in Cabernet Sauvignon and Vranac. In Cabernet Sauvignon, defoliation initially delayed berry growth, but at harvest, only the treatment ‘defoliation-cluster thinning’ had significantly lower berry weight. In cultivar Vranac, defoliation did not modify the berry growth and berry weight. In both varieties, <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> had no effect on the berry weight. In the treatment ‘defoliated-thinned’, reduction of the cluster weight, berry weight, and berry number per cluster is observed. This is probably the consequence of a lower fruit set, where the defoliation had a greater impact on the first cluster. Cabernet Sauvignon showed a greater reactivity to the applied techniques, compared to Vranac. At harvest, no damaged bunches (caused by sunburn) were found in defoliated treatment. Early defoliation and <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> in both varieties raised the concentration of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. The enhanced contents of these compounds per berry in grape variety Vranac are the result of increased synthesis, while in Cabernet sauvignon variety, increased content was due to the less berry weight. Defoliation and <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> led to better soluble solid accumulation than in the control sets (no treatments applied). The skin extracts contained the highest content of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in the treatment defoliated-thinned followed by the treatment thinned, while these contents were higher in wines from the vineyards where defoliation was applied. It could be due to better extraction of these compounds during winemaking. Additional work is in progress to verify that early leaf removal and <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> do indeed result in better quality of Vranac wine.|$|R
30|$|<b>Cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> is {{described}} as the suppression of <b>flowers</b> or <b>clusters</b> before full maturation [14]. Therefore, <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> has a direct effect on the source/sink ratio; having less sinks (fruits) photosynthetic assimilation might be improved, increasing grape quality [15]. It inducts physiological adjustments in the plant, improving the maturation’s kinetics. Plus, this operation improves canopy sanitary conditions as thinning allows more enlightenment and fresh air penetration in the vegetation and clusters [16]. Cluster thinning’s most evident effect is apparently crop load reduction, but its decrease is not equivalent to the thinning’s intensity. Martins [17] found that, for the same intensity of thinning, in two consecutive years, the decline in production has been uneven. In fact, the vine compensates the stack lost, increasing the berry’s volume and weight [18]. For this reason, Climaco et al. [19] suggests that <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> must only be executed in the years when vineyards have such a fertility that may possibly undermine production quality. <b>Cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> advances grape maturity, improves grape quality, and also influences the chromatic characteristic of the wine [20].|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Death {{of flower}} parts near bloom due to {{inflorescence}} necrosis (IN) {{is associated with}} high ammonium (NH₄⁺) concentration in <b>flower</b> <b>clusters,</b> shade, cool wet weather preceding bloom, and excessive vigor. Faults in NH₄⁺ assimilation are suspected to cause a rise in NH₄⁺ concentration to toxic levels in <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> but not other tissues. In this study, shading whole vines of Pinot noir increased flower NH₄⁺ concentration if applied at budbreak (early) or 1 wk before bloom (late), but only late application of shade to individual shoots raised it.
