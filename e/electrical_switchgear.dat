In this paper, on the basis of analyzing the connection property and switchgear configurations of collection systems of offshore wind farms, a comprehensive reliability assessment model and the corresponding calculation method for the traditional switchgear configuration and the complete switchgear configuration are proposed. Taking an actual planned offshore wind farm for example, the reliability of two switchgear configurations are evaluated, and the sensitivity analyses on factors affecting the reliability of the wind farms such as the failure rate and MTTR of the cables and switchgears are performed. The result shows that the complete switchgear configuration is the better choice for offshore wind farms considering reliability indexes. ...|$|R

40|$|Electrical treeing is of {{interest}} to the electrical generation, transmission and distribution industries as {{it is one of the}} causes of insulation failure in <b>electrical</b> machines, <b>switchgear</b> and transformer bushings. Previous experimental investigations of electrical treeing in epoxy resins have found evidence that the tree structures formed were either electrically conducting or non-conducting, depending on whether the epoxy resin was in a flexible state (above its glass transition temperature) or in the glassy state (below its glass transition temperature). In this paper we extend an existing model, of partial discharges within an arbitrarily defined non-conducting electrical tree structure, to the case of electrical conducting trees. With the inclusion of tree channel conductivity, the partial discharge model could simulate successfully the experimentally observed partial discharge activity occurring in trees grown in both the flexible and glassy epoxy resins. This modelling highlights a fundamental difference in the mechanism of electrical tree growth in flexible and glassy epoxy resins. The much lower resistivities of the tree channels grown in the glassy epoxy resins may be due to conducting decomposition (carbonized) products condensing on the side walls of the existing channels, whereas, in the case of non-conducting tree channels, subsequent discharges within the main branches lead to side-wall erosion and a consequent widening of the tubules. The differing electrical characteristics of the tree tubules also have consequences for the development of diagnostic tools for the early detection of pre-breakdown phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Metadata only entryElectrical treeing is of {{interest}} to the electrical generation, transmission and distribution industries as {{it is one of the}} causes of insulation failure in <b>electrical</b> machines, <b>switchgear</b> and transformer bushings. In this paper a deterministic electrical tree growth model is described. The model is based on electrostatics and local electron avalanches to model partial discharge activity within the growing tree structure. Damage to the resin surrounding the tree structure is dependent on the local electrostatic energy dissipation by partial discharges within the tree structure and weighted by the magnitudes of the local electric fields in the resin surrounding the tree structure. The model is successful in simulating the formation of branched structures without the need of a random variable, a requirement of previous stochastic models. Instability in the spatial development of partial discharges within the tree structure takes the role of the stochastic element as used in previous models to produce branched tree structures. The simulated electrical trees conform to the experimentally observed behaviour; tree length versus time and electrical tree growth rate as a function of applied voltage for non-conducting electrical trees. The phase synchronous partial discharge activity and the spatial distribution of emitted light from the tree structure are also in agreement with experimental data for non-conducting trees as grown in a flexible epoxy resin and in polyethylene. The fact that similar tree growth behaviour is found using pure amorphous (epoxy resin) and semicrystalline (polyethylene) materials demonstrate that neither annealed or quenched noise, representing material inhomogeneity, is required for the formation of irregular branched structures (electrical trees). Instead, as shown in this paper, branched growth can occur due to the instability of individual discharges within the tree structure...|$|R
