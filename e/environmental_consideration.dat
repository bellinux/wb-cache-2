40|$|Activities in {{the fuzzy}} {{front end of}} the {{innovation}} process (FFE) are the root of success for any company hoping to compete on the basis of innovations. Considering the importance of the FFE, it would seem logical to bring the <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> already to the activities of {{the early stages of the}} innovation process in order to generate environmental innovations. However, there is still little understanding on how to, in practice, best bring <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> into this part of the innovation process. There are two central questions considered in this paper: are companies integrating <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> into the FFE activities and if yes, how? In this paper we illustrate the current FFE practices from the perspective of <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations.</b> The paper is based on in-depth interviews with eight multinational companies, based in Europe. The interviews reveal that most companies do have experience with considering the environmental requirements in the FFE, but there are significant differences in the “green” FFE practices in terms of frequency, structure and the role the environmental requirements play in the activities of the FFE. The paper also initiates discussion into what type of opportunities for environmental innovations could become apparent when <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> are integrated into the FFE.

5000|$|The {{sustainable}} seafood {{movement is}} a young one, tracing its origins back to 1996 when Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) began discussions on how to assure the long-term sustainability of global fish stocks {{and the integrity of}} the marine ecosystem. These talks {{led to the creation of}} the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the world’s first seafood eco-label provider, in 1997. Three years later, the first MSC certified fishery was announced. At the same time, the Monterey Bay Aquarium was distributing the first version of the Seafood Watch wallet card for consumers, identifying good and bad seafood choices based on <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For site selection, 760 ha of Homebush Bay was {{selected}} for use though the area was not planned upon completion until 2010. Sydney's selection to host the 2000 Summer Olympics changed this. The States Sports Centre opened in 1984 and Bicentennial Park opened four years later. The Sydney International Aquatic Centre and Sydney International Athletic Centre were completed in 1994, but by 1995, it {{was determined by the}} Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee that venue construction needed to be accelerated. In 1995, Bob Carr was elected as New South Wales Premier with one of his first task was to develop a masterplan for venue construction. A plan was approved in February 1996 along with lessons learned from 1996 Summer Olympics led to modification of the plan in February 1997. <b>Environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> was taken during site selection and construction, including the planting of 16,000 trees around completed venues once construction was completed. Soil and water testing at Homebush Bay in the early 1990s determined that [...] of domestic, commercial, and industrial waste was located on 160 ha of the land, resulting in remediation. Other items involved at the venues were the removal of electrical transmission lines, the development of rail lines near the venues, {{the construction of a new}} ferry wharf, and construction of vehicular parking sites.|$|E

40|$|Products {{generate}} {{environmental impacts}} during their life cycle by consuming {{raw materials and}} energy, releasing emissions and producing waste. A procurement organisation can be a considerable driving force for more environmentally friendly products e. g. by requiring that products meet certain environmental criteria. The scope for <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> when procuring materiel can be limited by lack of reliable information about the environmental characteristics of the product or service. Different types of tools (e. g. eco-labels, guidelines, checklists and tools for environmental assessment) can contribute some knowledge and help identify environmentally preferable products. This thesis focuses on use of tools for <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in Swedish defence acquisition but the results are also relevant for other organisations, since the procurement process analysed is rather general and the legal requirements are similar for other public organisations in Europe. A Swedish government decision in 1998 requires the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF) and Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) to take <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in all phases of the acquisition process. The importance of a life cycle perspective is stressed in several SAF and FMV environmental documents. The starting point of this thesis was that <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> should be taken in the Swedish acquisition of defence materiel, considering the whole life cycle of products, {{with the aim of}} formulating proposals on environmentally friendly procurement. Some Ecodesign tools were reviewed and evaluated, two methods for simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were compared, tools and methodology were recommended, and used to study military materiel, and environmental Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was examined. In environmental work lacking a life cycle perspective, the most significant aspects risk being overlooked. Use of quantitative and/or simplified LCAs and inclusion of environmental costs in LCC are therefore recommended. LCA proved an appropriate tool for involving <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in the acquisition process, since it focuses on products and their life cycle. The MECO method proved best for simplified LCA. These suggested methods were evaluated by interviews with actors in the acquisition process. Four areas for LCA use in acquisition were identified: learning about environmental aspects of products; fulfilling customer requirements; setting environmental requirements; and choosing between alternatives. The interviewees were interested in using LCA, but {{there is a need for}} an initiative by one or several actors if the method is to be used regularly and the results must be communicated within the organisations involved in procurement. <b>Environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> should be taken early in the acquisition process and environmental matters integrated into other activities of the organisations involved. Environmental costs are not explicitly considered in the LCCs used by the interviewees today, but internal environmental costs should be included. Costs likely to be internal can also be included.

30|$|The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U {{test was}} {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} significant variation among the three categories of sustainability disclosure between PSBs and private sector banks in India. H 1 and H 3 are supported whereas, H 2 is not supported. The results of Mann-Whitney U test reveal that the disclosure of <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> indicators by PSBs (Mean[*]=[*] 25.5) is significantly higher than private sector banks (Mean[*]=[*] 17.5), U[*]=  136.5, z[*]=[*]−[*] 2.178, p[*]= . 029. The disclosure of internal socio-environmental conduct indicators by PSBs (Mean[*]=[*] 25.93) is also significantly higher than private sector banks (Mean[*]=[*] 17.07), U[*]=  127.5, z[*]=[*]−[*] 3.043, p[*]= . 002). However, there is no significant variation in the disclosure of social development indicators between PSBs (Mean[*]=[*] 22.50) and private sector banks (Mean[*]=[*] 20.5), U[*]=  199.5, z[*]=[*]−[*] 1.039, p[*]= . 299. The findings of the study show that both PSBs and private sector banks disclosed most of the social development indicators in their nonfinancial reporting whereas, the disclosure of <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> indicators and the internal socio-environment indicator is better among PSBs as against private sector banks in India. The increased level of adherence to the NVGs and BRR disclosure by PSBs has lead to a higher level of sustainability disclosure.|$|E
