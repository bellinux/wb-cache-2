40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve the {{micronutrient}} quality of indigenous African infant flour using traditional techniques available in the region. Response surface methodology was used to study the effect of duration of soaking, germination, and fermentation on phytate and phenolic compounds (PC), pH, viscosity, and the in vitro solubility (IVS) of iron and zinc in infant sorghum flour. The phytate and the PC concentrations of the flour were significantly modified as a result of the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and fermentation and their mutual interaction. These modifications were accompanied by a significant increase in % IVS Zn after 24 h of sprouting. Except for the interaction of soaking and fermentation, none of the processing parameters exerted a significant effect on the % IVS Fe. The viscosity of the porridge prepared with the flour decreased significantly with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> making it possible to produce a porridge with high energy and nutrient density. The use of germination in combination with fermentation is recommended in the processing of cereals for infant feeding in developing countries...|$|E

The physical features of the kernels that were determined included the endosperm texture, endosperm type and kernel size. Also determined were the germination energy and germination capacity. To monitor the malting properties, the malting loss, hot water extract, cold-water extract and diastatic power were determined. The effect of <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> on the root and shoot lengths of kernels was also investigated. Two of the cultivars were floury while the other cultivars were corneous. All the cultivars were non-waxy. The mean percentage values of the germination energy and germination capacity were 84. 92 % and 91. 75 % respectively. As the germination period increased, root and shoot lengths of all the twelve cultivars also increased. The greatest change in the root and shoot lengths was observed between the second and third day of the germination period. The malting loss increased with the germination period and ranged between 15. 5 - 33. 0 %. The malting loss for all cultivars reached its peak between the second and third day of germination.

40|$|Aims Flooding {{disturbance}} {{can change}} the species composition of plant communities. Field investigation showed that annual herbs were {{an important part of}} the natural vegetation of the water-level-fluctuating zone (WLFZ) in the Three Gorges Reservoir, but there are few studies on the effects of flooding on annual plants. Annual, which reproduce from seeds, usually grow fast and can rapidly rehabilitate areas. Our objective is to determine the effects of water submergence on the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> seeds of annuals, with regard to possible use of annual plants in vegetation restoration of WLFZ in the Three Gorges area. Methods Seeds of four annuals, Echinochloa crusgali, Setaria pumila, Digitaria sanguinalis and Arthraxon hispidus, were collected in autumn 2008 in Wushan County of Chongqing Municipality. Seeds for control (CK) were kept in envelopes; seeds for water submergence treatments were buried in soil in plastic containers and water was poured into the containers to maintain a water layer on the soil surface. We used six different <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> water submergence, 30, 75, 115, 155, 195 and 240 days, to match water level operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. After treatments ended, seeds were separated from soil by water flushing and filtering with gauze. The treated seeds were incubated in pots filled with soil watered daily. Three replicates of 50 seeds per sample were used for each treatment. Germinated seeds were counted daily until the end <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> Important findings Water submergence significantly affected seed germination rate and <b>germination</b> course <b>of</b> all four annuals. Germination rates first increased and then decreased with increased <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> submergence. <b>Germination</b> rates with short-time submergence treatments were significantly higher than CK. Submergence can break seed dormancy and increase the rate <b>of</b> seed <b>germination.</b> Submergence also accelerated the course <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> Short-time submergence treatments increased germination indices significantly greater than in CK, and the germination periods were shorter, but long-time submergence had little effect on the course <b>of</b> seed <b>germination.</b> Overall, the <b>germination</b> rates <b>of</b> all treatments of all annuals were > 40 %.

Obtaining and screening clones, through the selection process, depend on the good management of germination conditions of seeds {{obtained by}} genetic selection. With this purpose, a Split-plot design was used to evaluate the effect of various factors (light, germination medium and treatment of seeds) on the germination of seeds and on other parameters related to the rate and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> The results, obtained indicated that a high sunlight intensity increased the rate and the speed of seed germination. Among the treatments carried out, the cold treatment of the seeds increased the rate of germination from 30 to 70 %.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate changes during germination in chemical composition, phytic acid, phytase activity and total and extractable minerals of lentil cultivars. Three Sudanese lentil cultivars (Rubatab, Nadi and Selaim) were germinated for 3 and 6 days. The germinated seeds were dried and milled. Proximate composition, phytic acid content, phytase activity and hydrochloric acid (HCl) extractability of minerals were determined. During germination crude fat and fiber increased, whereas nitrogen free extract (NFE) and food energy decreased. Phytic acid content decreased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) with an increase in germination time. Germination resulted in a decrease in total phytate phosphorous with correspondingly marked increase in non-phytate phosphorus. Total and extractible minerals (P, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cu and Zn) were positively correlated with <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> except Cu and Zn. Germination for 3 days increased phytase activity significantly (p≤ 0. 05) for all cultivars. Phytase activity of Rubatab cultivar continued to increase up to 6 days of germination, however, for Nadi and Selaim cultivar it slightly decreased.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the effects of sorghum {{bioprocessing}} into Gowé on iron bioavailability and antioxidant properties of the final products. Gowé is an African sour beverage, whose process combines malting and fermenting of sorghum grains. The effects of the durations of germination and fermentation on the phytochemicals were evaluated using a central composite design. The antioxidant capacity and iron bioavailability of the derived flour were also evaluated. During the germination process, the tannin content of the grain decreased from 429. 5 to 174. 1 mg/ 100 g DM, while the total phenolic content increased from 300. 3 to 371. 5 mg GAE/ 100 g DM. The phenolic acid contents of the flour were significantly modified as a result of the durations of germination and fermentation. Both germination and fermentation enhanced the antioxidant capacity of sorghum flour, and antioxidant characteristics were significantly correlated with the levels of total phenolics, tannins, and phenolic acids. Phytate content of sorghum grain decreased drastically from 1003 to 369. 1 mg/ 100 g DM when the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> or fermentation increased.

However, these scarification techniques often produce inconsistent germination. Percussion scarification, where seeds are repeatedly propelled against a hard surface, was compared {{with hot water}} scarification to evaluate treatment efficacy for New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana) and black locust (R psendoacacia) seeds. In the hot water treatment, seeds were placed in a 98 O C water bath, which was immediately removed from the heat source. For percussion scarification, seeds were placed in a soil sample tin and agtated in a paint shaker for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 minutes. All treatments, including the control, were followed by 24 -hour water soaks. Hot water baths resulted in 56 % and 41 % germination for New Mexico locust and black locust respectively.

Dry seeds treated with constant white light, red light or blue light during 8 days and subsequently incubated in dark had final germination and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> reduced, {{and the distribution of}} germination changed from highly asymmetric to symmetric respectively. Imbibing seeds incubated under constant blue or white light had final germination strongly reduced seven days after sowing (7. 3 % and 50. 1 % of the germination under dark) with significant differences between them. After transferral to dark, true complete recovery of germination of seeds treated with white light was observed 19 days after sowing, but only partial recovery in seeds treated with blue light. Results of dry and imbibed seeds are consistent with no activity of phytochromes, as expected in negatively photoblastic seeds. Results of dry seeds are seemingly contradictory because total germination data imply the inactivity of red and blue light photoreceptors, the opposite being implied by duration and shape of germination. A tentative hypothetical solution for the contradiction is presented. Results of imbibed seeds are fully consistent with cryptochromes but not with phototropins mediation of responses to light of seed germination in ‘Seaton Park’.

40|$|Effects of {{four levels}} of soil salinities (viz. 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 % by weight on growth and {{development}} of different cotton cultivars were investigated. These studies were started with sixteen cotton cultivars at germination stage, out of which five cultivars (viz. B 557, Niab 78, Sarmast, Qalandari and Rohi) which showed better performance, were selected for further work. A delay in the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> proportional to the increasing salinity levels, was observed in all the cotton cultivars. Since emergence of seedlings was very poor at higher levels of salinities, ten days old seedlings raised on normal soil and hardened by saline water irrigation, were transplanted directly in the pots containing above mentioned levels of soil salinities. On {{the basis of their}} vegetative biomass production, these cultivars were graded as Rohi> Sarmast> Qalanderi> B 557 > Niab 78 on the different levels of salinities. Lower rate of relative growth (RGR) during early period under salt stress prolonged the vegetative growth period as a result the reproductive growth was carried the plants to relatively colder season. This change of climate brought a decrease in pollen germination, inhibition in fertilization and reduction in yield. Germination of pollen grains in vitro also demonstrated adverse effects of low temperaturesAnatomical adaptations as effects by salinity stresses were seen in the form of increased mesophyll surface area and relatively large size of stomata, which could be helpful in maintaining exchange rate of CO 2 under saline environmentIonic distribution indicated greater transportation of Na+ to the aerial parts of the plants. They were still capable of maintaining this ratio above one even under higher salinity regimesReproductive potential of these cultivars was studied by recording monopodial and sympodial branchings, total fruiting points (squares), flowers and bolls in cotton plants under normal and saline conditions. If percent reduction in yield is taken as criteria of salt tolerance, these cultivars could be graded as B 557 > Nib 78 > Qalanderi> Sarmast> Rohi respectively. It was interesting to note that inspite of being susceptible to salinity, some cultivars due to growth vigour give such a good yield that the amount of their produce excelled than that of salt tolerant cultivars. On the basis of the tonnage, the comparative performance of the cultivars under study was as Qalandari> Niab 78 > B 557 > Sarmast> Rohi even under the highest level of salinity.

Under the experimental condition employed, the first phase <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> B. cereus spores lasted for approximately 75 ± 15 sec, whereas the second phase lasted for 3 to 4. 5 min. In B. megaterium spores, the first phase was observed to last for approximately 2 min and the second phase for more than 7 min. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the second phase was dependent on conditions employed for <b>germination.</b> The kinetics <b>of</b> the first phase were strikingly similar under all conditions <b>of</b> physiological <b>germination.</b> Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy of germinating spores also revealed the biphasic nature <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> It was postulated that the first phase represents changes induced by an initial partial hydration of the spore and release into the medium of dipicolinic acid, whereas the second phase reflects degradation of the cortex and hydration of the core...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} <b>of</b> {{assaying}} <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> bdellocysts in liquid medium has been devised. Bdellocysts can be induced to germinate {{by any of}} eight L-amino acids or the monovalent cations K+ and NH 4 +. L-Glutamine was the best individual inducer <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> although the resulting rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> was much slower than in a complex medium. The use <b>of</b> a defined <b>germination</b> medium containing L-glutamine, KCl, and NH 4 Cl produced a faster rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> than did complex media. Bdellocysts germinated most rapidly at pH 8. 0 and at 35 degrees C and required aerobic conditions. Respiration of bdellocysts began to increase at 3 min after the addition <b>of</b> germinants. <b>Germination</b> was inhibited by respiratory-chain inhibitors and by inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis. When bdellocysts were heat shocked at sublethal temperatures for short periods, there was {{no effect on the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in the defined germination medium or in the complex medium. However, heat-shocked bdellocysts germinated at a much faster rate in the presence of single inducers <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> when compared to nonshocked bdellocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyze the effect of different substrata in the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. ex Lam.) Urb. (Bombacaceae). The experiment was conducted in delineation randomized with three treatments (substratum) and four repetitions of 25 seeds. The following substrata had been tested: sand + vermiculite (1 : 1); vermiculite and, sand + shavings (1 : 1). The effect of substrata through the percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> the seeds, average time <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and index <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> speed (IGS) were evaluated. There had been significant difference between the treatments in of all the observed variable. The seeds, when conditioned in vermiculite, had presented the biggest tax <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> greatest speed and lowest germination time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Seed <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> two pasture legumes {{was tested}} under dark {{conditions}} at three alternating temperatures of 5 - 20, 15 - 20, 20 - 35 C and constant 20 C. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> the alternating temperatures was 12 h. The seedling counts were checked every day during four weeks. Species differed significantly in germination response to temperature. A. hamosus was {{more sensitive to}} temperature than C. scorpioides. The temperature of 20 - 35 C was more favourable for the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> A. hamosus than constant 20 C which markedly reduced its germination. The interaction between accessions and temperatures for total germination was significant in both species. In A. hamosus, almost 50 % <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> was achieved by all accessions by the first week at alternating 20 - 35 C temperature while in C. scorpioides, average total germination was significantly low (4 %) even by the 28 th day. A total rate of 11 and 9 % <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> were recorded by two accessions from Ouesslatia (210) and Agareb (19), respectively. A considerable variation for germination was observed among accessions of both species. Temperature requirements for seed <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> the studied species suggest why they are relatively easy or difficult to establish in the field. A. hamosus, with very small seeds required relatively high alternating temperature for germination than C. scorpioides which was insensitive to temperature and has relatively bigger seeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{role that}} plant-derived smoke plays in {{promoting}} seed germination is well documented, but {{little is known}} about its ability to inhibit seed germination. To better understand this phenomenon, we tested the effects of eight aerosol smoke treatments on the Columbia- 3 ecotype of nondormant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seeds. Our results revealed that aerosol smoke significantly inhibits germination when seeds were exposed to prolonged periods of aerosol smoke. Short <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> smoke treatments significantly promoted the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> A. thaliana seed. We briefly discuss this dual regulation of smoke and its possible impact on conservation and restoration practices. We also propose that plant-derived smoke may be another vehicle by which allelochemicals can be introduced into the environment...|$|R
40|$|Phytotoxic studies {{strongly}} {{depend on}} evaluation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> responses, which implies {{the need for}} adequate procedures to account for distinct aspects of the germinative process. For this, indices, comparisons among treatments at various times, and model fitting have been proposed. The objective of this work is to compare the three approaches and select the one providing greater insight and precision. Speed <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> speed <b>of</b> accumulated <b>germination,</b> the coefficient <b>of</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> comparisons at each determination time, including final germination, and {{the parameters of the}} Weibull function were examined. The Weibull function proved the best approach to describe the germination process, providing not only the same type of information about the speed <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> with greater precision, but also additional information about the initiation and shape <b>of</b> the <b>germination</b> response curve...|$|R
40|$|Cotton {{seedlings}} {{were subjected}} to a 96 hour chilling treatment (5 ° or 10 °) after periods <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> at 31 ° ranging from 0 to 48 hours. Inhibition of subsequent growth at a favorable temperature by chilling was dependent on level of low temperature and stage of seedling development when chilled. Two periods of chilling hypersensitivity were observed during germination: 1) coincident with subjection of seed to a germination environment; and 2) after 18 to 30 hours <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> at 31 °. Subsequent growth of seedlings chilled after 12 to 18 hours or 48 hours <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> at 31 ° was relatively unaffected. It is suggested that chilling alters specifically timed events that occur at the initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and after 18 to 30 hours <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> and that alteration <b>of</b> these <b>germination</b> processes is visited on long term subsequent growth of the plant...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} incubation experiment (20 ℃) {{was conducted}} to find if the detrimental effects of seed-soaked Cu on wheat seedlings can be minimized by reducing time <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> seed in contact with Cu EDTA fertilizer solution. The 24 treatments in a 6 x 4 factorial arrangement included 6 rates/amounts of Cu (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 g Cu 100 kg- 1 seed) and 4 seed-soaking time durations (0, 4, 8 and 16 h). The <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed was 100 % in the zero-Cu control treatments, irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> seed soaking time. However, seed germination decreased with increasing amount of fertilizer Cu in the seed-soaking solution, and the magnitude of reduction in seed germination due to Cu toxicity increased with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> seed-soaking time in the Cu fertilizer solution. For the seed-soaked treatments, the detrimental effect <b>of</b> Cu on <b>germination</b> was greatest with 16 h soaking, where only 13 % - 18 % of the seeds germinated with Cu applied at 15 to 30 g Cu 100 kg- 1 seed. For the 4 and 8 h seed soaking treatments, <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed ranged from 73 % to 83 % with 15 g Cu 100 kg- 1 seed treatment and 42 % to 62 % with 30 g Cu 100 kg- 1 seed. The {{findings suggest that the}} detrimental effect <b>of</b> Cu on <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed soaked in Cu EDTA solution can be decreased by reducing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> soaking time from 16 h to 4 or 8 h, but this needs further investigation using soil under growth chamber and/or field conditions in order to make valid recommendations for use of this new technology on a commercial scale...|$|R
