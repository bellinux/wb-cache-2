According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>a</b> version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E

5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>a</b> close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima was <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>a</b> historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, A {{man with}} {{criminal}} {{and drug abuse}} history attempted to rob a store in Prague, armed with a knife. He managed to stab the store owner, but was shot by his wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting as legitimate self-defense. This case is notable, because the store the man attempted to rob was a gun store, leading many to speculations that the robbery was, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>a</b> suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>a</b> small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E

After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis' children, the rift between them grew until war broke out in 1203. Genghis captured Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter of Toghrul's brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son Tolui; they had several children, including Möngke, Kublai, Hulagu, and Ariq Böke.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} castles by historians and archaeologists {{developed}} considerably during the 20th century.

The Victoria County History of England began to document the country's castles on an unprecedented scale, providing an additional resource for historical analysis.|$|E
