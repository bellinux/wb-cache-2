50|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the <b>drilling</b> <b>jar</b> is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars {{are designed to be}} reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness isdetermined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.|$|E
40|$|Stuck pipe is {{a common}} problem with {{tremendous}} impact on drilling efficiency and costs in the oil industry. Generally, the stuck pipe troubles are solved after their occurrences by using some standard operational procedures such as working the drill string up or down, attempting to rotate the string and pumping mud at higher flow rates through the drill bit to aid pipe release. One may also place different fluids around the stick area and use a <b>drilling</b> <b>jar.</b> However, in cases where common solutions don't work, then the cutoff is the last resort. To have a successful cutoff operation, estimating {{the location of the}} free point and choosing the right cutting tool is of vital importance. This paper presents the Radial Cutting Torch (RCT) as a innovative cutting tool and its oilfield application in stuck pipe events...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{fracture}} failure {{research on}} a <b>drilling</b> <b>jar’s</b> top joint {{was carried out}} on basis of correlative theories and tests. Macroscopic analysis, dimension measurement and nondestructive testing were done for failure joint. The material’s chemical and physical properties were tested. The drilling strings assembly was analyzed specially and the bending strength ratio between top joint and adapter joint was calculated detailedly. The {{results showed that the}} <b>drilling</b> <b>jar’s</b> joint was broken because of fatigue induced by irrational drilling strings assembly and improper matching between top joint and adapter joint. The joint’s fatigue life was reduced further because material’s impact toughness is less than standard value...|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Christensen Diamond Products {{opened its}} {{manufacturing}} plant in Celle, Germany. The facility built diamond core heads and drilling bits and soon began producing stabilizers, <b>drilling</b> <b>jars</b> and other equipment. In 1977, the Celle engineering and manufacturing team introduced the Navi-Drill line of downhole drilling motors, {{which has led}} the drilling industry in performance and reliability for three decades. Other innovations developed in Celle include the industry's first steerable motor system, and the AutoTrak Rotary Closed Loop System. In 2007, the Celle Technology Center became Baker Hughes' leading research and engineering facility in the Eastern Hemisphere.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} {{success of}} {{cable tool drilling}} has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, in the salt well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received [...] for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well <b>drilling.</b> Later, using <b>jars,</b> the cable tool system was able to efficiently {{meet the demands of}} drilling wells for oil.|$|R
60|$|Weston {{did as he}} was bidden, {{and spent}} the rest of the morning {{alternately}} holding the <b>jarring</b> <b>drill</b> and swinging a hammer. It was strenuous work which demanded close attention, for the hammer was heavy, and it is far from easy to hit a drill neatly on the head, while the man who fails to do so runs the risk of smashing the fingers of the comrade who holds it. It was not much more pleasant when he gripped the drill in turn, for, though the other man stood on a plank inserted in a crevice, Weston had to kneel on a slippery slope of rock and twist the drill each time the hammer descended. The concussion jarred his stiffened hands and arms. The distressful stitch also was coming back into his side, and once or twice his companion cast an expostulating glance at him.|$|R
60|$|He did not {{remember}} how she set him talking, but he told her whimsical, and now and then grim, stories {{of his life in}} the shadowy Bush, and she listened with quick comprehension. She seemed to endow him with that quality, too, since, as he talked, he began to realize, as he had never quite comprehended before, the something that lay behind the tense struggle of man with Nature and all the strenuous endeavour. Perhaps he expressed it in a degree, for now and then the girl's eyes kindled as he told of some heroic grapple with giant rock and roaring river, gnawing hunger, and loneliness, and the beaten man's despair. He found her attention gratifying. It was certainly pleasant, though he had not consciously adopted the pose, to figure in the eyes of such a girl as one who had known most of the hardships that man can bear and played his part in the great epic struggle for the subjugation of the wilderness. As it happened, she did not know that those who bear the brunt of that grim strife are for the most part dumb. Their share is confined to swinging the axe and gripping the <b>jarring</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|R
40|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{technology was}} extended and modified to drill the first well of a subsurface geothermal energy extraction {{system at the}} Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock (HDR) experimental site. Borehole geometries, extremely hard and abrasive granite rock, and high formation temperatures combined to provide a challenging environment for directional drilling tools and instrumentation. Completing {{the first of the}} two-wellbore HDR system resulted in the definition of operation limitations of -many conventional directional drilling tools, instrumentation, and techniques. The successful completion of the first wellbore, Energy Extraction Well No. 2 (EE- 21), to a measured depth of 4. 7 km (15, 300 ft) in granite reservoir rock with a bottomhole temperature of 320 C (610 F) required {{the development of a new}} high-temperature downhole motor and modification of existing wireline-conveyed steering tool systems. Conventional rotary-driven directional assemblies were successfully modified to accommodate the very hard and abrasive rock encountered while drilling nearly 2. 6 km (8, 500 ft) of directional hole to a final inclination of 35 {sup o} from the vertical at the controlled azimuthal orientation. Data were collected to optimize the drilling procedures far the programmed directional drilling of well EE- 3 parallel to, and 370 metres (1, 200 ft) above, Drilling equipment and techniques used in drilling wellbores for extraction of geothermal energy from hot granite were generally similar to those that are standard and common to hydrocarbon drilling practices. However, it was necessary to design some new equipment for this program: some equipment was modified especially for this program and some was operated beyond normal ratings. These tools and procedures met with various degrees of success. Two types of shock subs were developed and tested during this project. However, downhole time was limited, and formations were so varied that analysis of the capabilities of these items is not conclusive. Temperature limits of the tools were exceeded. EE- 2. Commercial <b>drilling</b> and fishing <b>jars</b> were improved during the drilling program. Three-cone, tungsten-carbide insert bit performance with downhole motors was limited by rapid gauge wear. Rotary drilling was optimized for wells EE- 2 and EE- 3 using softer (IADS 635 code) bits and provided a balance between gauge,. cutting structure, and bearing life. Problems of extreme drill string drag, drill string twist-off, and corrosion control are discussed...|$|R
