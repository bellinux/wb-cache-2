2500|$|One {{characteristic}} of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone. The conversion of flow energy to sound comes from an interaction between a solid material and a <b>fluid</b> <b>stream.</b> The forces in some whistles are sufficient to set the solid material in motion.

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ fluid amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. Fluid amplifiers {{rely on a}} <b>fluid</b> control <b>stream</b> to switch a <b>fluid</b> power <b>stream.</b> <b>Fluid</b> amplifiers are so named because a low-energy fluid control signal can control and switch a high-energy <b>fluid</b> power <b>stream</b> to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the fluid control signal. In fluid amplifiers, a <b>fluid</b> power <b>stream,</b> after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying fluid control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit end of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid pressure imbalance adjacent the exit end of the nozzle to effect switching of the <b>fluid</b> power <b>stream.</b>|$|R
