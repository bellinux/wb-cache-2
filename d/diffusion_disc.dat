Results are presented which suggest that the `empty' centre of the ring zones is due to an excess of attached antibody.

The appearance of ring zones is favoured by a low density of antigens on the culture. These findings and a number of synergistic effects produced by mixing ring and filled zone reactions are compatible with the hypothesis that the ring zone is produced when several antibodies of different specificities react with restricted antigenic areas carrying densely located clusters of antigenic determinants representing the different specificities contained in the ring zone sera. The crowding of antibodies on the clusters in the centre of the ring zones creates a steric hindrance for the indicator cells so that they are not firmly attached in this area. The antibody zone is therefore indicated as a peripheral haemadsorption ring...|$|E

Results: The zone of inhibitions obtained from the antibacterial agar <b>diffusion</b> <b>disc</b> method showed that CF, and EF exhibited active (14 - 19 mm) antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis UST CMS 1011, and partially active (10 - 13 mm) antibacterial properties against both Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228.

Several countries established surveillance programs for antimicrobial use in animals and in Portugal we also have the PANRUAA, since 2014, that encourages antimicrobial use reduction in animals. As swine production is one of the food industries where the antimicrobial use deserves attention, we collected laboratory data from pig samples to obtain information on antimicrobial resistance in Portuguese swine production. Escherichia coli is an indicator bacteria of normal intestinal flora of swine and in this study, we used Escherichia coli isolates to analyze antimicrobial resistance. Our aim was to contribute to the knowledge of antimicrobial resistance frequencies in Portuguese swine farms. Seventy seven strains of E. coli were isolated from intestinal swabs or stools of swine with symptoms of enteric pathology. Those samples came from 26 different farms and antimicrobial resistance was evaluated according to CLSI guidelines, by <b>diffusion</b> <b>disc</b> method. All Escherichia coli strains were resistant to more than one antimicrobial. Lincomycin, Doxycycline, Amoxycillin, Ampicillin and Oxytetracycline were the antimicrobials with the highest frequency of resistant strains. The lowest frequencies of antimicrobials resitant strains were found for Neomycin, Gentamicin, Ceftiofur and Marbofloxacin. Comparing antimicrobials resistance frequencies from both years, we found a significant increase for Amoxycillin, Apramycin, Colistin, Oxytetracycline and Lincomycin - Spectinomycin.

40|$|Abstract: In this research, we have {{aimed to}} {{determine}} antagonistic effects of various lactic acid bacteria against Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria with a comparison of <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> and spot-on-lawn method. In spot-on-lawn method, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was the most sensitive of the tested bacteria, followed by E. coli ATCC 25927 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145. On the other hand, in <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> assay B. subtilis ATCC 6633, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 were the most sensitive indicator microorganisms. The spot-on-lawn method was suitable for assessing the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria. In general, inoculum density {{had little effect on}} inhibition.

40|$|Objectives: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is {{commonly}} used to treat melioidosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> method {{is commonly}} used in melloidosis-endemic areas, but may overestimate resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Patients and methods: We performed <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> and Etest on isolates from the first positive culture for all patients presenting to Sappasithiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, with cultureconfirmed melioldosis between 1992 and 2003. Results: The estimated resistance rate for 1976 clinical Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates was 13...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES <b>Disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{is still}} {{largely based on}} manual procedures. Technical {{variations}} originate from inoculum preparation, variations in materials, individual operator plate streaking and reading accuracy. Resulting measurement imprecision contributes to categorization errors. Biological variation resembles the natural fluctuation of a measured parameter such as antibiotic susceptibility around a mean value. It is deemed to originate from factors such as genetic background or metabolic state. This study analysed the relative contribution of different technical and biological factors to total <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> variation. METHODS For calculation of relative error factor contribution to <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> variability, five experiments were designed keeping different combinations of error factors constant. A mathematical model was developed to analyse the individual error factor contribution to <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> variation {{for each of the}} tested drug-species combinations. RESULTS The contribution of biological variation to total diameter variance ranged from 10. 4 % to 98. 8 % for different drug-species combinations. Highest biological variation was found for Enterococcus faecalis WT and vancomycin (98. 8 %) and for penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin G (96. 0 %). Average imprecision of automated zone reading revealed that 1. 4 %- 5. 3 % of total imprecision was due to technical variation, while materials, i. e. antibiotic discs and agar plates, contributed between 2. 6 % and 3. 9 %. Inoculum preparation and manual plate streaking contributed 6. 8 %- 24. 8 % and 6. 6 %- 24. 3 %, respectively, to total imprecision. CONCLUSIONS This study illustrates the relative contributions of technical factors that account for a significant part of total variance in <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion.</b> The highest relative contribution originated from the operator, i. e. manual inoculum preparation and plate streaking. Further standardization of inoculum preparation and plate streaking by automation could potentially increase the precision of <b>disc</b> <b>diffusion</b> and improve the correlation of susceptibility reports with clinical outcome...|$|R
