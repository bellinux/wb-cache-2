Matrix tablets for the controlled delivery of gliclazide were prepared by hot melt method using pure and blended mixture of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> and stearic acid in different drug to polymer and polymer to polymer ratios. In vitro release characteristics of gliclazide from these hydrophobic matrices were studied over 8 h in phosphate buffer media of pH 7. 4. The release kinetics of drug was evaluated for zero order, first order, Higuchi and Peppas kinetic models. It was observed that the release of drug from the matrix was greatly retarded by GMS and retarding effect increased with increasing polymer to drug ratios. On the other hand SA appeared to channel the drug from the wax matrix and release was greatly increased with increasing polymer to drug ratios. The kinetic evaluation of release profile indicated that the Higuchi model was the most appropriate model for describing the release profile of gliclazide. The application of Peppas biexponential equation indicated that non-Fickian release was the predominant mechanism of drug release. The FTIR results showed no interaction between the drug and the polymers and DSC results indicated that both the drug and polymers are in amorphous state and no significant complexes were formed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to research the effect of different surfactants on the water vapor permeability and physical properties of edible films made from tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum(dHG). The film-forming solution was made from tapioca starch/ dHG {{at a ratio of}} 1. 7 / 0. 3, and with 20 % glycerol as plasticizer based on the weight of starch/dHG. Surfactants used in this study include <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS), Span 80, Tween 80, lecithin and sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) at different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 25 % of the total solid content). Starch/dHG composite films were obtained by casting. The results implied that the films with GMS showed the best water vapor barrier properties among all films in this study, and the barrier propeties significantly increased with increasing GMS. However, addition of Tween 80 could not improve the water vapor barrier properties of the cassava starch/dHG films. In addition, the thickness of films increased with increasing surfactant, but a decreasing tendency was observed in tensile strength and tensile strain at break. SEM of the starch/dHG/surfactant composite films revealed that the arrangement of surfactants molecules in the film and interaction between surfactant and starch/dHG modified the microstructure of starch/dHG film. In other words, the addition of different surfactants made the water vapor barrier and physical properties of starch/dHG film change significantly. 本實驗研究的目的為探討不同界面活性劑對樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠(dHG) 可食膜水氣阻隔與物性的影響。樹薯澱粉/dHG 以 1. 7 / 0. 3 的比例形成固形物為 2 %的可食膜溶液，以甘油為塑化劑，食用級乳化劑作為界面活性劑，包含單甘油硬脂酸 (<b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate)</b> 、Span 80 、Tween 80 、卵磷脂 (lecithin) 、乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (sodium stearoyl lactylate) 等五種，濃度為 5 %、 10 %、 20 %、 25 %，並以鑄模法 (casting) 製得樹薯澱粉/dHG/surfactant 複合膜。研究結果發現，添加單甘油硬脂酸(GMS) 對可食膜的水氣阻隔性有最好的效果，並且隨濃度上升有顯著性的增加，其次是乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (SSL) 及卵磷脂 (lecithin) ，但Tween 80 及 Span 80 則對水氣的阻隔並沒有改善。在對樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜物性影響方面，界面活性劑的添加雖然使厚度增加，但一般而言卻降低了可食膜的透明度、抗張強度及抗張形變量。由掃描式電子顯微鏡結果顯示，界面活性劑的添加因其分子排列及與澱粉/dHG 分子的交互作用，造成樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的細微結構改變，也因此導致樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的水氣阻隔及機械強度等性質產生變化。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	vii 壹、	前言	 1 貳、	文獻回顧	 3 一、	可食膜 (edible film) 	 3 (一) 	背景及定義	 3 (二) 	可食膜的組成份	 5 1. 	碳水化合物	 5 2. 	蛋白質	 6 3. 	脂質	 6 4. 	塑化劑 (plasticizer) 	 7 二、	可食膜的製備及應用	 8 三、	樹薯澱粉可食膜	 9 四、	仙草葉膠	 11 五、	樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠 (dHG) 可食膜	 15 六、	界面活性劑	 17 (一) 	HLB值 (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) 	 19 (二) 	臨界微胞濃度 (critical micelle concentration，CMC) 	 20 (三) 	食品上的乳化劑	 20 七、	等溫吸濕曲線 (Moisture sorption isotherm, MSI) 	 22 八、	可食膜的機械性質 (Mechanical Properties) 	 26 九、	水氣透過性質	 30 參、	材料與方法	 33 一、	仙草葉	 33 二、	澱粉	 33 三、	甘油	 33 四、	界面活性劑	 33 (一) 	Tween 80 	 35 (二) 	Span 80 	 35 (三) 	Lecithin	 35 (四) 	<b>Glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS) 	 35 (五) 	Sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) 	 35 五、	脫色仙草葉膠之萃取、化學成分及分子量	 37 (一) 	仙草葉膠之萃取及脫色	 37 (二) 	基本成分分析	 37 1. 	水分含量	 37 2. 	灰份 (ash) 測定	 38 3. 	粗脂肪 (crude fat) 測定	 38 4. 	粗蛋白測定	 39 5. 	粗纖維 (crude fiber) 測定	 39 (三) 	金屬離子含量測定	 40 (四) 	醣醛酸含量測定	 41 (五) 	脫色仙草葉膠分子量分佈	 42 六、	可食膜溶液及可食膜之製備	 43 (一) 	可食膜溶液製備	 43 (二) 	可食膜製備	 44 七、	可食膜性質測定	 44 (一) 	可食膜溶液快速黏度分析	 44 (二) 	厚度測定	 45 (三) 	水分含量	 45 (四) 	等溫吸濕曲線	 46 (五) 	水氣透過性	 47 (六) 	穿刺試驗	 48 (七) 	抗張試驗	 48 (八) 	場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡結構觀察	 49 (九) 	不透明度分析	 49 八、	統計分析	 50 肆、	結果與討論	 51 一、	脫色仙草葉膠化學組成份	 51 二、	快速黏度分析	 54 三、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜外觀	 62 四、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜厚度及含水量	 64 五、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜不透明度分析	 67 六、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜微結構觀察	 72 七、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜等溫吸濕曲線	 76 八、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜水氣透過性(WVP) 	 81 九、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜機械性質	 88 (一) 	穿刺試驗	 88 (二) 	抗張強度試驗	 89 伍、	結論	 99 陸、	參考文獻	 10...|$|E

Complexation yields, relative crystallinities, dissociation temperatures and enthalpies increased with amylose chain lengths (DP 20 -DP 60 -DP 400). Relative crystallinities and thermal stabilities of the DP 950 -complexes were {{slightly lower than}} those of the other amylose fractions, probably due to increased conformational disorders, resulting in crystal defaults. Molecular weight distributions of the complexes revealed that, irrespective to the complexation temperature, the critical DP for complex formation and precipitation was 35 and 40 for complexes with GMS and C 22, respectively, corresponding to the length needed to accommodate two GMS- or C 22 -molecules within an amylose helix. Complexation of dextrins with a well-chosen lipid, allows to separate starch derived dextrins with a predictable critical chain length as border. Dextrins, of sufficient DP will complex and precipitate, while the shorter dextrins will remain in solution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) by changing the concentration of active ingredient and solid lipid in the Orthosiphon stamineus (O. stamineus) loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation. O. stamineus extract was prepared by maceration method. From the HPLC analysis, the O. stamineus extract contains 38 % sinensetin and 62 % rosmarinic acid. The method used to prepare the formulation of O. Stamineus loaded NLC is melt emulsification homogenization technique. Solid and liquid lipid used were <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> and triglyceride respectively. It was found that the size of particles increased as increasing in concentration of active and solid lipid in the formulation. The best range for concentration of active and solid lipid are 1 - 4 % and 1 - 3 % respectively since the particle size and PDI needed are below 200 d. nm and 0. 2. Collectively, based on particle size and PDI results show that the NLC system is highly potential to be a carrier of transdermal delivery for O. stamineus...|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} {{are typically}} spherical {{with an average}} diameter between 1 and 1000 nm. It is an alternative carrier system to tradition colloidal carriers, such as, emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric micro and nanoparticles. Ramipril is an antihypertensive agent used {{in the treatment of}} hypertension. Its oral bioavailability is 28 % and it is rapidly excreted through the renal route. This drug has many side effects such as, postural hypotension, hyperkalemia, and angioedema, when given as an immediate dosage form. To overcome the side effects and to increase the bioavailability of ramipril, solid lipid nanoparticles of ramipril are prepared by using lipids (<b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> and glyceryl monooleate) with stabilizers (tween 80, poloxamer 188, and span 20). The prepared formulations have been evaluated for entrapment efficiency, drug content, in-vitro drug release, particle size analysis, scanning electron spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared studies, and stability. A formulation containing glyceryl monooleate, stabilized with span 20 as surfactant showed prolonged drug release, smaller particle size, and narrow particle size distribution, as compared to other formulations with different surfactants and lipids...|$|E
40|$|Rectal {{delivery}} of drugs {{has been proven}} {{to be effective in}} terms of drug absorption and distribution comparable with other routes such as oral, buccal, sublingual or even nasal. In this study, two new suppository bases were developed using combinations of locally sourced hydrogenated palm kernel oil, hydrogenated palm kernel stearin and hydrogenated palm kernel olein with mixtures of stearic acid and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate.</b> When formulated with aspirin, these bases produced suppositories with acceptable characteristics. These aspirin suppositories were tested on twelve healthy subjects after an approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University of Malaya had been procured. We quantified aspirin from the urine samples of the subjects to determine the relative availability of the different suppository preparations relative to an oral dose. The excretion of salicylic acid, one of the metabolite of aspirin in human urine taking aspirin was quantified. The F value was found to range from 1. 16 to 1. 38.

However, a 100 -μm-diameter nozzle was used, indicating {{that the type of}} lipid and saturation time also have a significant role in particle size definition. Equipped with an 80 -μm-diameter nozzle and under the same pre-expansion conditions, the same authors showed less attractive results from lipid particles synthesized with beeswax and menthol. A multimodal population of particles ranging from 45 to 180 μm was obtained [100]. By application of similar conditions, Sampaio de Sousa and colleagues [62] achieved <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> microparticles of about 5 μm loaded with caffeine, though, owing to the hydrophilicity of caffeine, it was necessary to use water as co-solvent. Further studies on the formulation under 13 MPa and 345 K with the addition of Cutina® HR and titanium dioxide, an anticaking additive, showed that the low affinity of hydrophilic compounds such as caffeine and glutathione resulted in a low payload and a burst release. Otherwise, a lipophilic compound, ketoprofen, presented a high entrapment rate and sustained release (t 2 h = 20 %) [63].|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost steroidal ointments contain {{propylene}} glycol (PG) and surfactants, which improve the solubility of corticosteroids in white petrolatum. Surfactants aid the uniform dispersal of PG within white petrolatum. Since the surfactants used in generic ointments are usually {{different from those}} used in brand name ointments, we investigated the effects of surfactants on the rheological properties of three brand name ointments and six equivalent generic ointments. We detected marked differences in hardness, adhesiveness, and spreadability among the ointments. Further examinations of model ointments consisting of white petrolatum, PG, and surfactants revealed that the abovementioned properties, especially hardness and adhesiveness, were markedly affected by the surfactants. Since steroidal ointments are often admixed with moisturizing creams prior to use, we investigated the mixing compatibility of the ointments with heparinoid cream and how this was affected by their surfactants. We found that the ointments containing <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> demonstrated good mixing compatibility, whereas those containing non-ionic surfactants with polyoxyethylene chains exhibited phase separation. These results were also {{consistent with the findings}} for the model ointments, which indicates that the mixing compatibility of steroidal ointments with heparinoid cream is determined by the emulsifying capacity of the surfactants in their oily bases...|$|E
40|$|Drugs from {{nitroimidazole}} {{category are}} generally bitter in taste. Oral formulation with bitter taste is not palatable. Geriatrics and pediatrics patients usually suffer from swallowing difficulties. Many other patients in some disease conditions avoid swallowing tablets. Satranidazole {{is a new}} nitro-imidazole derivative with bitter taste and is available in market as film coated tablet. The purpose {{of this research was}} to mask the bitter taste of Satranidazole by coating complexation with low melting point wax and Eudragit EPO. Different types of wax (<b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate,</b> stearic acid and cetyl alcohol) were tried for taste masking. The drug to stearic acid ratio 1 [*]:[*] 2 was found to be optimum on the basis of taste evaluation and in vitro release. The formulated granules were found to possess good flow property. FTIR studies confirmed that there was no interaction between drug and excipients. Scanning Electron Microscopy of drug and the optimized batch of granules was performed. The in vitro release of drug from granules was compared with marketed tablet formulation. The taste masked granules of optimized batch showed 87. 65 % release of drug in 1 [*]hr which is comparable to that of marketed tablet formulation...|$|E
40|$|I T {{has been}} shown that serum {{triglyceride}} concentration is affected by many factors. Some of these factors like age, 1 obesity, 2 ’ 3 physical activity 4 and diet 5 have been investi-gated extensively. Elevated serum triglyc-eride levels have been reported in coronary heart disease 6 and in diabetes. 7 The present study was designed to evaluate the response of subjects, with respect to postprandial triglyc-eridemia, to test meals containing glycerides of the same chain length, but with various degrees of unsaturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fasting ambulatory male volunteer subjects, aged twenty-three to twenty-nine years, were fed emulsi-fled diets which contained known quantities of either an unsaturated or a saturated mono- or triglyceride. The fats compared in this study were glyceryl mono-linoleate versus <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate,</b> cottonseed oil versus hydrogenated cottonseed oil, and corn oil versus partially hythogenated corn oil. These fats were homogenized with milk proteins in a commercial high speed Waring blendor to insure uniform emulsi-fication.

A control film (FS 100 %) was also prepared. Determination of swelling index (Is%) and permeability and physicochemical analysis were carried out. Formulations containing 95 : 5 or 90 : 10 FS: B-CD ratio and about 5 % of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>monostearate</b> (GMS) as a glidant provided homogeneous, continuous, and flexible films. Water vapour transmission (WVT) increased {{with an increase in}} B-CD concentration. On the other hand, how major was the B-CD amount lower was found the Is% for the film. Physicochemical analysis using TG revealed an initial thermal decomposition temperature shift that indicated lower thermal stability for films with 90 : 10 or 95 : 5 FS: B-CD ratio compared with the control (100 : 0). The results of FT-IR did not give evidence of any intermolecular interaction between B-CD and the acrylic polymer, showing just a physical mixture of both components in formulation...|$|E
