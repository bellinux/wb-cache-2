40|$|Introduction: The medical {{dispatching}} call service made by croatian nurses {{is crucial}} in its significance and responsibility in taking and receiving calls, setting priorities and allocating resources. The best indicators {{of the quality of}} its effect are the changes in <b>call</b> response time, <b>reception</b> time, delay time - which is defined as time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, and protocol compliance. The introduction of the new Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index protocol, which is modified from the Norwegian Index of medical Emergencies, resulted in a new model of aiding criteria-based decisions. We examined the efficiency of the dispatching service which is based on Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index protocol. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of one year period and compared results according to criteria given by the Norwegian index, between index and control group. All the included participants had NACA Severity of Injury or Illness Index score 5 - 7. There {{were no significant differences between}} the participants in both groups based on the subjects’ age and gender. We included 40 participants [20 indexes and 20 control group]. Results: Average <b>call</b> <b>reception</b> and reaction time as well as elapsed time, defined as a time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, were significantly shorter in the index group, where the <b>call</b> <b>reception</b> and reaction time were 111 seconds, compared to 180 seconds in the control group. Average elapsed time between receiving a call and the intervention team’s arrival to the patient was 11. 3 minutes for the index group, and it was 15. 5 minutes for the control group. Average time elapsed between receiving a call and the patient’s admission to the emergency department was 32 minutes for the index group and 52 minutes for the control group. Discussion: Seeing as the dispatching service is dynamic, demanding and highly responsible, it is subject to constant monitoring of quality indicators. The implementation of the Croatian Emergency <b>Call</b> <b>Reception</b> Index significantly improved the management of Emergency Medical service...|$|R

50|$|E has {{two ways}} of sending messages: the <b>immediate</b> <b>call</b> and the {{eventual}} send. An <b>immediate</b> <b>call</b> is just like a typical function or method call in a non-concurrent language: the sender waits until the receiver finishes and returns a value. An eventual send sends the message while producing a placeholder for the result called a promise. The sender proceeds immediately with the promise. Later, when the receiver finishes and yields a result, the promise resolves to the result. Since only eventual sends are allowed when communicating with remote objects, deadlocks cannot happen. In distributed systems, the promise mechanism also minimizes delays caused by network latency.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} benefit of <b>immediate</b> <b>call</b> or {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) for survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). Methods: Of 952, 288 OHCAs in 2005 - 2012, 41, 734 were bystander-witnessed cases without prehospital involvement of physicians but with bystander CPR (BCPR) on bystander's own initiative. From those OHCAs, we finally extracted the following three call/BCPR groups: <b>immediate</b> <b>Call</b> + CPR (N= 10, 195, emergency call/BCPR initiated at 0 or 1 min after witness, absolute call-BCPR time interval = 0 or 1. min), immediate Call-First (N= 1820, emergency call placed at 0 or 1 min after witness, call-to-BCPR interval = 2 - 4. min), immediate CPR-First (N= 5446, BCPR initiated at 0 or 1. min after witness, BCPR-to-call interval = 2 - 4 min). One-month neurologically favourable survivals were compared among the groups. Critical comparisons between Call-First and CPR-First groups were made considering arrest aetiology, age, and bystander-patient relationship after confirming the interactions among variables. Results: The overall survival rates in <b>immediate</b> <b>Call</b> + CPR, Call-First, and CPR-First groups were 11. 5, 12. 4, and 11. 5 %, respectively without significant differences (p= 0. 543). Subgroup analyses by multivariate logistic regression following univariate analysis disclosed that CPR-first group {{is more likely to}} survive in subgroups of noncardiac aetiology (adjusted odds ratio; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 01; 1. 39 - 2. 98) and of nonelderly OHCAs (1. 38; 1. 09 - 1. 76). Conclusions: Immediate CPR-first action followed by an emergency call without a large delay may be recommended when a bystander with sufficient skills to perform CPR witnesses OHCAs in nonelderly people and of noncardiac aetiology. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
