500|$|The Katangese secession {{would prove}} to be {{politically}} influential in Africa. During the Chadian Civil War between 1965 and 1979, the Front de Libération Nationale du Tchad (FROLINAT) explicitly rejected secessionism in its bid to remove the southern-backed government of François Tombalbaye following the experience of the Katanga secession, officially stating that [...] "there will be no Katanga in Chad". In the Nigerian Civil War, between 1967 and 1970, the ethnically Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria which it accused of privileging the interests of northern ethnic groups and discriminating against the Igbo. The secessions of Biafra and Katanga have frequently been compared <b>in</b> <b>academic</b> <b>writing.</b> Unlike Katanga, Biafra achieved limited official international recognition and rejected the support of Western multinational companies involved in the local oil industry. Biafra was defeated in 1970 and re-integrated into Nigeria.|$|E

[...] "Science" [...] was counterposed to [...] "religious superstition" [...] in the media and <b>in</b> <b>academic</b> <b>writing.</b> The main religions of pre-revolutionary Russia persisted throughout the entire Soviet period, but they were only tolerated within certain limits. Generally, this meant that believers were free to worship in private and in their respective religious buildings (churches, mosques, etc.), but public displays of religion outside of such designated areas were prohibited. In addition, religious institutions were not allowed to express their views in any type of mass media, and many religious buildings were demolished or used for other purposes.|$|E

40|$|Page | 5 Abstract The MA thesis explores finite {{progressive}} forms <b>in</b> the <b>academic</b> {{spoken and}} <b>written</b> monologue. The English progressive forms generally appear much less frequently than the simple forms do. <b>In</b> <b>academic</b> spoken language 90 per {{cent of the}} finite verb forms consist of simple forms and the representation of simple forms is even higher <b>in</b> <b>academic</b> <b>written</b> language with 95 per cent of the finite verb forms being simple. The reasons for this distribution are related {{on the one hand}} to the specific meaning of the progressive forms, {{and on the other hand}} to the restricted compatibility of the progressive forms and some semantic verb classes. The present study considers both of these aspects in the attempt to describe the progressive forms <b>in</b> the <b>academic</b> spoken monologue (university lectures) and <b>in</b> the <b>academic</b> <b>written</b> language (advanced students' papers). The material is excerpted from two British academic English corpora, namely BASE (spoken language) and BAWE (written texts), 100 examples from each corpus. The material is analyzed at the formal, functional and discourse levels. The formal analysis deals with the distribution of tense forms, negation, the subject (person and animacy) and clause types. The functional criteria involve the semantic features of the verb and subject, as well as the [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{collection}} of manuscripts of Sahidic translations is often designated by copsa <b>in</b> <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> and critical apparatus ("Sa" [...] for [...] "versio Sahidica" [...] in BHS). The first translation into the Sahidic dialect {{was made at}} the end of the 2nd century in Upper Egypt, where Greek was less well understood. So the Sahidic is famous for being the first major literary development of the Coptic language, though literary work in the other dialects soon followed. By the ninth century, Sahidic was gradually replaced by neighbouring Bohairic, and disappeared. Knowledge of the Sahidic manuscripts was lost until they were rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1778 Woide issued a prospectus in which he announced his intention of publishing from Oxford manuscripts the fragments of the New Testament [...] "iuxta interpretationem dialecti Superioris Aegypti, quae Thebaidica seu Sahidica appellantur". Another fragments were published in 1884 by Émile Amélineau. Amélineau also edited other fragments in 1886-1888.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in the 1970s, Albert Fried, a biographer and historiographer of Brown, {{concluded}} that historians who portrayed Brown as a dysfunctional figure are [...] "really informing me of their predilections, their {{judgment of the}} historical event, their identification with the moderates and opposition to the 'extremists.'" [...] It is this less studied, highly interpretive view of Brown that has prevailed <b>in</b> <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> {{as well as in}} journalism; as biographer Louis DeCaro Jr. wrote in 2007, [...] "there is no consensus of fairness with respect to Brown in either the academy or the media." [...] The portrayal by some writers of Brown as another Timothy McVeigh or Osama bin Laden may still reflect the same bias that Fried discussed a generation ago. DeCaro likewise complains of writers taking [...] "unstudied liberties" [...] and concludes that in the 20th century alone, [...] "poisonous portrayals [...] so prevalent as virtually to have formed one long screed of hyperbole and sarcasm in the name of historical narrative." ...|$|E
