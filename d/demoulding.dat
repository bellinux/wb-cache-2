Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon <b>demoulding</b> the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same mould, unlike plaster moulds which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life.

They are made {{in a number of}} discrete stages beginning with deposition of unaerated shell chocolate into the bar moulds. A frozen cone shaped to fit into the bar is then pushed down to spread the liquid chocolate into the entire mould and set it. The aerated chocolate is then deposited into the centre and the moulds are shaken to distribute the chocolate evenly in the cavity. This is then chilled to set the bubbly chocolate in place before a final backing off deposit is created to give the back. The moulds are then shaken again to get a flat even back. The moulds are specially shaped to ensure that no meniscus is formed on the bottom, which can give the chocolate a scuffed appearance and also cause issues with the machines when they break off and build up. The bars are then chilled again for a longer period.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect that a novel {{texturing}} of replication tools by applying amorphous hydrogenated carbon (aC:H) coating has on the processing conditions in micro injection moulding. Texturing usually increases the surface area of tools leading to higher <b>demoulding</b> forces acting on the component during the ejection stage of the process.

With respect to chocolate adhesion {{it is expected that}} the balance of the adhesion force between the chocolate and the mould and the cohesion force within the chocolate itself determines the stickiness at the chocolate-mould interface during <b>demoulding.</b> The research presented investigated the effect of surface thermodynamics and processing conditions on the observed extent of adhesion of (aerated) chocolate to four different mould materials (quartz glass, stainless steel, polycarbonate, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)). Surface energy of solid mould materials was calculated from experimental surface tension and contact angle data.

In injection moulding, using hydraulic motor to drive gears and cores with thread for automatically taking plastic-injected parts with thread off from the cores is a common method for thread <b>demoulding.</b> The thread <b>demoulding</b> is completed by two movements. One of them is realized by {{the rotation of the}} threaded cores driven by hydraulic motor; the other is to stop the injected plastic part from turning and meanwhile push it out by a pushing plate.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to substitute wet chemical mould coatings in the plastic and rubber processing by PVD and CVD coatings. Suitable mould coatings should show good <b>demoulding</b> characteristics, a positive wear-resistance and advantageous corrosion attributes. To judge the <b>demoulding</b> performance, trials with laboratory moulds were made and a <b>demoulding</b> device was built, enabling you to measure <b>demoulding</b> forces directly. PVD and CVD coatings showed reduced (up to 20 - 25 %) <b>demoulding</b> forces compared with uncoated and galvanic chrome coated moulds. The influence of mould release agents are significantly stronger than the influence of different mould coatings. Due to the 2 to 4 times (TiC) higher micro hardness (Vickershardness) of PVD and CVD coatings compared with hardened steal and galvanic chrome, a higher wear-resistance of the moulds had been achieved. This helps against abrasive parts of the rubber formulation and abrasive mould cleaning. A higher corrosion resistance of some CVD and PVD coatings had been proved by extensive laboratory trials and corrosion tests as well as long term production use. CVD coatings and multilayers with CVD basic coatings are clearly more corrosion resistant than galvanic chrome coatings. It was proved during the project that PVD and CVD coatings can substitute the use of wet chemical galvanic chrome mould coating. (orig.)

40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{is used by}} {{many for}} nanoimprint {{applications}} due to its affordability, ease of preparation, mechanical flexibility, compatibility with imprint resists and transparency to UV light. However PDMS is notoriously flexible, tacky and permeable to air. Here fluorinated ethylene–propylene (FEP) is considered as a viable and versatile alternative material for nanoimprint stamps. FEP possesses many of the desirable nanoimprint attributes associated with PDMS but crucially also features a range of complementary characteristics, including {{an order of magnitude}} more mechanical strength allowing it to handle higher loads than PDMS, an intrinsically non-stick surface and is compatible with oxygen sensitive resists. Unlike elastomeric polymers, FEP is glassy so patterning may be realised via hot embossing. Not only is this a facile and rapid means of physical structuring but it also facilitates combinatorial patterning, providing a versatility beyond that of traditional casting materials. Due to the intrinsically slow creep of FEP both micro- and nanopatterning are successfully performed sequentially. Feature sizes from 45 nm were successfully realised via the hot-embossing method. To further demonstrate the potential of the material, a modified computer numerical control machine is used.
