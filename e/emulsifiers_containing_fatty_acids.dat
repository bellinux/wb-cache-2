40|$|The DNA {{relaxation}} {{activity of}} Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I in vitro was greatly inhibited by cardiolipin. Inhibition also occurred {{to some extent}} with phosphatidylglycerol from egg yolk. Analysis with synthetic phospholipid revealed that phosphatidylglycerol <b>containing</b> unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> exhibited a strong inhibitory effect, whereas inhibition by phosphatidylglycerol <b>containing</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was weak. Phosphatidylethanolamine showed no inhibitory effect. Chlorpromazine, which interacts with phospholipids, suppressed the inhibitory effect of cardiolipin. Cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol with unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> precipitated topoisomerase I even at low concentrations, whereas phosphatidylglycerol from egg yolk and a synthetic phosphatidylglycerol <b>containing</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> precipitated this enzyme only at high concentrations.
