Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio State will return 90 percent of their total offensive production. The Buckeyes could return 100 percent of their scoring contingent next season. All five first-team All-Conference honorees were sophomores and are all projected to return as juniors. Overall, the Big Ten could return 80.5 percent of its offensive production from 2008 to 2009, and no team should lose {{more than half of}} its total scoring unit next year.|$|E
5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of {{representative}} democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression. This paves the way for discussion {{of the state of}} affairs in the country, as expressed by representatives of the people, which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians. Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations. This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature, administration and governmental <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> then strive to make improvements.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

The course generally lasts nine months and has substantially less holiday than an undergraduate course. Emphasis is placed on class room teaching alongside independent study.|$|E

25|$|Political {{institutions}} (such as a constitution) {{determine the}} de jure (or written) distribution of political power, while {{the distribution of}} economic resources determines the de facto (or actual) distribution of political power. Both de jure and de facto political power distribution affect the economic institutions in how production is carried out, {{as well as how}} the political <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> be shaped in the next period. Economic institutions also determine the distribution of resources for the next period. This framework is thus time dependent—institutions today determine economic growth tomorrow and institutions tomorrow.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli {{economy is}} driven by {{industries}} based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country’s defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines {{are rooted in the}} basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, {{it is not clear how}} these <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{geographically}} affiliated {{names have}} been updated to reflect {{the name of the}} city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from [...] "Århus Å" [...] to [...] "Aarhus Å". It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose, most newspapers and public <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> accept it. Some official authorities such as the Danish Language Committee, publisher of the Danish Orthographic Dictionary, still retain [...] "Århus" [...] as the main name, providing [...] "Aarhus" [...] as a new, second option, in brackets and some institutions are still using [...] "Århus" [...] explicitly in their official name, such as the local newsmedia Århus Stiftstidende and the schools Århus Kunstakademi and Århus Statsgymnasium for example.|$|E
50|$|Institutions {{generally}} {{require a}} minimum satisfactory grade in each course taken. Students should check course equivalency maps and transfer guides to validate how courses in one <b>institution</b> <b>will</b> {{relate to the}} potential receiver institution. Even though prior courses may be comparable, {{it does not mean}} the receiving <b>institution</b> <b>will</b> count the course credit toward degree completion. Prior courses taken could either be accepted as electives, accepted as filling a degree requirement or not accepted at all.|$|R

2500|$|On May 18, 2010, the German Minister of Finance {{announced}} that naked short sales of euro-denominated government bonds, credit default swaps {{based on those}} bonds, and shares in Germany's ten leading financial <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> be prohibited. This ban went into effect that night and was set to expire on March 31, 2011. On May 28, German financial market regulator BaFin {{announced that}} this ban would be permanent. The ban is effective July 27, 2010. The International Monetary Fund issued a report in August 2010 saying that the measure succeeded only in impeding the markets. It said the ban [...] "did relatively little to support the targeted institutions’ underlying stock prices, while liquidity dropped and volatility rose substantially." [...] The IMF {{said there was no}} strong evidence that stock prices fell because of shorting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{length of}} time allowed to {{complete}} the work for an 'I' grade varies from a deadline {{in the first few}} weeks following the end of term to a full calendar year, the latter being more usual. [...] For some courses (such as independent studies or thesis/dissertation credits), or in some situations (such as subsequent non-enrollment), the time allowed for completion may be indefinite. [...] Some <b>institutions</b> <b>will</b> convert the 'I' grade to an 'E' or 'F' (failing) grade if the student does not complete the course {{by the end of the}} time period; others simply make the 'I' grade permanent at that time; and a few institutions retroactively withdraw the student from the course, changing the 'I' to a 'W' grade. [...] Most institutions allow students to apply for an extension of the completion time, upon presentation of special circumstances.|$|E
