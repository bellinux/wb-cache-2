50|$|However, it is {{sometimes}} possible for an outsider to ascertain whether an <b>internal</b> <b>requirement</b> or procedure has been complied with. If {{it is possible to}} ascertain this fact from the company's public documents, the doctrine of disclosure and the doctrine of constructive notice will apply and not the Turquand rule. The Turquand rule was formulated to keep an outsider's duty to inquire into the affairs of a company within reasonable bounds, but if the compliance or non-compliance with an <b>internal</b> <b>requirement</b> can be ascertained from the company's public documents, the doctrine of disclosure and the doctrine of constructive notice will apply. If it is an <b>internal</b> <b>requirement</b> that a certain act should be approved by special resolution, the Turquand rule will therefore not apply in relation to that specific act, since a special resolution is registered with Companies House (in the United Kingdom), and is deemed to be public information.|$|R

40|$|Context and motivation: Finding {{a balance}} between {{commercial}} (customer specific, market pull and external quality <b>requirements)</b> and <b>internal</b> quality <b>requirements</b> is a recognized challenge in market driven software product development (MDSPD). In order to address this challenge {{it is important to}} understand the preferences and biases influencing decision makers selecting requirements for software releases. Question/problem: Prospect theory has been successfully applied to many disciplines. Applying it to MDSPD suggests decision makers will avoid risk when selecting between commercial requirements, take risk with <b>internal</b> quality <b>requirements,</b> and prefer commercial <b>requirements</b> over <b>internal</b> quality <b>requirements</b> in order to maximize their perceived value. This paper seeks to investigate this claim. Principal ideas/results: This paper presents an experiment investigating whether the biases proposed by prospect theory can be seen operating in MDSPD requirements engineering (RE). The results indicate risk avoidance when dealing commercial requirements, while greater risk is taken when dealing with <b>internal</b> quality <b>requirements.</b> Contribution: As this is the first paper to use prospect theory to explain requirements selection decisions, it presents opportunity to educate people in the biases they bring to the RE process, and facilitate the creation of strategies for balancing the different requirements types...|$|R

50|$|Technology {{scouting}} can {{be regarded}} as a method of technology forecasting or in the broader context also an element of corporate foresight.

50|$|PIK lenders, {{typically}} special funds, {{look for}} a certain minimum internal rate of return, which can come from three major sources: arrangement fee, PIK, and warrants. There are also minor sources, like a ticking fee. The arrangement fee, usually payable up-front, contributes the least return and is more aimed to cover administrative costs. PIK is interest accruing period after period, thus increasing the underlying principal (i.e., compound interest).
