Captives might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> excruciating torture {{for hours and}} even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E

Lúthien gave Sauron two options: either {{surrender}} {{to her the}} magical control he had established over Tol-in-Gaurhoth, or have his body destroyed so that his naked ghost would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the scorn of Morgoth. Sauron yielded, and Huan let him go. Lúthien destroyed the tower and rescued Beren from the dungeons.|$|E

25|$|With little {{income and}} unable to provide enough for all his children, Noah Grant had the eleven year old Jesse apprenticed out to various families. Beginning in 1805, from 11 to 14 years old, Jesse worked in Ohio at undesignated farms earning his keep and making little extra money. He didn't receive a formal {{education}} in his youth and later through years of apprenticeship became self-taught {{in the ways of}} general education and business. Placing great value on the merits of education he vowed that his sons would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the same disadvantage. With no public schools in most of Ohio in the early 1800s, Jesse would later send his son Ulysses to private schools.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to legalise {{euthanasia}} {{took place in the}} United States, when Henry Hunt introduced legislation into the General Assembly of Ohio in 1906. Hunt did so at the behest of Anna Hall, a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited Lurana Sheldon and Maud Ballington Booth, and organised a debate on euthanasia {{at the annual meeting of}} the American Humane Association in 1905 – described by Jacob Appel as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Wayang klitik figures {{occupy a}} middle ground between the figures of wayang golek and wayang kulit. They are {{constructed}} similarly to wayang kulit figures, but from thin pieces of wood instead of leather, and, like wayang kulit figures, are used as shadow puppets. A further similarity {{is that they are}} the same smaller size as wayang kulit figures. However, wood is more subject to breakage than leather. During battle scenes, wayang klitik figures often sustain considerable damage, much to the amusement of the public, but in a country in which before 1970 there were no adequate glues available, breakage generally meant an expensive, newly made figure. On this basis the wayang klitik figures, which are to appear in plays where they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> battle scenes, have leather arms. The name of these figures is onomotopaeic, from the sound klitik-klitik, that these figures make when worked by the dalang.|$|E

500|$|Kyle's {{depiction}} on {{the show}} has drawn both praise and criticism from the Jewish community. Detractors of the character cite his own habit of eschewing common Jewish practices and reiterating negative stereotypes for comedic purposes. Supportive Jewish viewers commend the show for using Kyle to accurately portray {{what it is like}} for a young Jew to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> loneliness and bigotry as an ethnic and religious minority. One of the show's more popular episodes, [...] "The Passion of the Jew" [...] (season eight, 2004), deals largely with Kyle's religious anxiety. The episode was independently released on DVD along with two other religion-themed episodes from the series.|$|E
500|$|After Scroggie Creek, {{the trail}} {{switches}} from a westerly direction to almost directly north. At this point, mushers enter the gold-mining district surrounding Dawson City. From the Stewart River adjacent to Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory's Black Hills. Fifty miles (80km) from Dawson City and [...] from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the Indian River, and mushers begin the climb to King Solomon's Dome, {{the highest point}} (...) on the trail. The trail ascends more gradually in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route than in the opposite direction, where mushers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> several switchbacks. When mushers start in Whitehorse, they already have gained several thousand feet from the ascent into the Black Hills, including a climb over 3,550-foot (1,082m) Eureka Dome. The main difficulties come during the descent from King Solomon's Dome to Bonanza Creek, {{the epicenter of the}} Klondike Gold Rush. After reaching the creek, mushers thread through an area of mining waste and follow the Klondike River to Dawson City, the halfway point of the race. They are required to rest for 36hours in Dawson City as a halfway-rest.|$|E
500|$|While {{some in the}} Jewish {{community}} have praised the show's depiction of Cartman holding an anti-Semitic attitude towards Kyle {{as a means of}} accurately portraying what it is like for a young Jew to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> prejudice, other Jews have blamed South Park and Cartman for having found themselves surrounded by [...] "acceptable racism". On November 20, 2008, a Facebook group titled [...] "National Kick a Ginger Day, {{are you going to do}} it?" [...] surfaced, suggesting abuse towards redheads. Thousands of internet users signed up as a member of the group, and reports of a feared increase of bullying of red-headed students across Canada soon followed. The group's administrator, a 14-year-old from Vancouver Island, said the group was only intended as a joke, and apologized for the offense it caused. The group was inspired by the season nine (2005) episode [...] "Ginger Kids", in which Cartman incites prejudice towards those with red hair, pale skin, and freckles, a group he calls [...] "Gingers" [...] and claims are inherently evil and without souls.|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, Lake Mead {{dropped to}} just [...] above the first [...] "drought trigger" [...] elevation, a {{level at which}} Arizona and Nevada would have to begin {{rationing}} water as delineated by the Colorado River Compact. Despite above-average runoff in 2011 that raised the immense reservoir more than , record drought conditions returned in 2012 and 2013. Reservoir levels were low enough {{at the beginning of}} water year 2014 that the Bureau of Reclamation cut releases from Lake Powell by [...] – the first such reduction since the 1960s, when Lake Powell was being filled for the first time. This resulted in Lake Mead dropping to its lowest recorded level since 1937, when it was first being filled. Rapid development and economic growth further complicate the issue of a secure water supply, particularly in the case of California's senior water rights over those of Nevada and Arizona: in case of a reduction in water supply, Nevada and Arizona would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> severe cuts before any reduction in the California allocation, which is also larger than the other two combined. Although stringent water conservation measures have been implemented, the threat of severe shortfalls in the Colorado River basin continues to increase each year.|$|E
500|$|In their pantomimes, the {{diminutive}} Leno {{and the massive}} Campbell were a visually comic duo. They would often deviate from the script, improvising freely. This was met with some scepticism by producers, who feared that the scenes would not be funny to audiences and observed that, in any event, they were rarely at their best until a few nights after opening. George Bernard Shaw wrote of one appearance: [...] "I hope I never again <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> anything more dismally futile", and the English essayist and caricaturist Max Beerbohm stated that [...] "Leno does not do himself justice collaborating with the public". [...] He noted, however, that Leno [...] "was exceptional in giving each of his dames a personality of her own, from extravagant queen to artless gossip". In Sleeping Beauty, Leno and Campbell caused the audience to laugh even when they could not see them: they would arrive on stage in closed palanquins and exchange the lines, [...] "Have you anything to do this afternoon, my dear?"– [...] "No, I have nothing on", before being carried off again. Leno and Campbell's pantomimes from 1889 were Jack and the Beanstalk (1889 and 1899), Beauty and the Beast (1890 and 1900), Humpty Dumpty (1891 and 1903), Little Bo-Peep (1892), Robinson Crusoe (1893), Dick Whittington and His Cat (1894), Cinderella (1895), Aladdin (1896), Babes in the Wood (1897) and the Forty Thieves (1898).|$|E
