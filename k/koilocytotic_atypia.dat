Koilocytosis correlated {{well with the}} histological diagnosis of condylomata, but occasionally it obscured the cytological evidence of CIN. Human papilloma virus particles {{were found in the}} cells of condylomata in 10 cases and in those of CIN II with koilocytosis in two cases of 21 examined ultrastructurally. There was evidence that the condyloma of the uterine cervix is a well-defined morphological entity and also that cytopathie changes similar to those seen in condylomata are present in some cases of CIN...|$|E
40|$|Four Asian lions (Panthera leo persica), two {{wild and}} two captive, were {{diagnosed}} with focal oral hyperplasia affecting the ventral surface of their tongues. Focal, flat, sessile lesions consisted of hyperplastic, stratified squamous epithelium. <b>Koilocytotic</b> <b>atypia</b> {{was evident in the}} upper layers of cells, some of which contained characteristic intranuclear papillomavirus particles visible by electron microscopy. In addition, large amphophilic cytoplasmic inclusions were evident in the koilocytes and were considered to be a product of the viral E 4 gene. Papillomavirus group-specific antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in the atypical cell nuclei. Conserved papillomavirus antigenic epitopes differed from epitopes found in cutaneous papillomavirus-induced lesions from domestic cats. An 8, 000 -base pair DNA fragment, linearized by Bam HI digestion, was detected by Southern blot hybridization probed with a mixed human papillomavirus genomic probe. Limited restriction endonuclease studies of DNA prepared using an oral hyperplastic lesion from an Asian lion indicate that this is a novel feline papillomavirus different from the domestic cat cutaneous papillomavirus. This new virus has been designated "PIPV". status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Dr Laverty {{recognised}} that cellular abnormalities {{known as}} koilocytosis and <b>koilocytotic</b> or “warty” <b>atypia</b> (first {{reported in the}} 1950s by Koss and associated with genital warts) were much more common in Pap smears than generally realised and that, surprisingly, in {{the great majority of}} cases clinical warts or condylomas were absent, even on careful clinical examination of the entire female genital tract. This raised the possibility that genital infections due to wart or papilloma virus were much commoner than previously thought, frequently cervical in location and very uncommonly of recognisable warty contour or configuration.|$|R
40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} is used commonly for {{detection of}} human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. There is little information, however, {{on whether the}} detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization can {{be affected by the}} way in which the tissue is fixed. To address this question, the authors compared the hybridization signal using this technique under low stringency conditions for several genital condylomata containing HPV 6 or 11 that were randomly subdivided and fixed in various fixatives for 16 hours. In all cases, the largest proportion of cells with <b>koilocytotic</b> <b>atypia</b> that had detectable HPV DNA was in buffered formalin-fixed tissue (80 %), followed by tissue fixed in unbuffered formalin (70 %), Hartman's solution (40 %), and Bouin's solution (10 %). After a high stringency wash, the greatest decrease in the overall hybridization signal was with tissue fixed in Bouin's solution; a minimal decrease was noted with tissue fixed in buffered formalin. Fixation in Bouin's solution for 2 hours gave in situ hybridization results comparable with buffered formalin fixation but with poorer cytologic detail. It is concluded that, of the fixatives studied, buffered formalin is superior for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization analysis...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examined}} 18 cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN) for {{the presence}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization and DNA-DNA in situ hybridizations for HPV DNA sequences and compared the epithelial distribution of HPV 16 DNA sequences with HPV 6 / 11 sequences in selected condylomas. Fifteen of the 18 CIN lesions contained HPV 16 DNA as determined by Southern blot hybridization. With the use of biotinylated HPV 16 DNA probes, 10 of the 18 were positive by in situ hybridization, 9 of which were also positive by Southern blot hybridization. In situ hybridization to HPV 16 probes was found primarily in areas of CIN which contained either maturation or <b>koilocytotic</b> <b>atypia,</b> although in two cases hybridizing sequences were detected in superficial cells from epithelium with no discernible maturation. Staining in both condylomas and CIN lesions varied in distribution and intensity. However, in some CIN lesions staining from cell to cell varied considerably. This greater variability in staining appeared to correlate with greater morphologic variations which characterize CIN, and which may influence greater variation in HPV DNA replication. Thus, some differences in patterns of hybridization for HPV DNA between CIN and condylomas may be explained by morphologic differences in the two classes of lesions. Differences in viral gene expression between condylomas and CIN and their relationship to morphologic findings remain to be clarified...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Recentemente tem sido observado um aumento da freqüência de diagnósticos de {{neoplasia}} intraepitelial vulvar grau III, principalmente em mulheres jovens. Estudos sobre o câncer genital apontam evidências de que a infecção pelo vírus do papiloma humano é um fator de risco importante para a transformação neoplásica epitelial. No período de 1983 a 1992 foram levantados 30 casos de l 1 eoplasia intraepitelial vulvar grau III e seis de carcinoma escamoso estádio Ia. A pesquisa do antígeno comum do capsídeo viral foi realizada através da imulloperoxidase. O estudo do tipo do vírus nas lesões foi realizada pela técnica de hibridização "in situ", com utilização de sondas biotiniladas dos HPV 6 / 11, 16 / 18 e 31 / 35 / 51. A idade média das pacientes com neoplàsia intraepitelial vulvar foi de 47, 5 anos e das com carcinoma estádio Ia, 61, 1 anos. Histologicamente foram observadas. atipias coilocitóticas em 83, 3 % dos casos. O exame da imunoperoxidase foi positivo em 36, 1 % dos casos, com idade,' média de 39, 1 anos. A detecção do vírus pela hibridização "in situ" ocorreu em 41, 7 % dos casos, com idade média de 38, 3 anos. Todos os casos positivos apresentaram o tipo 16 / 18, porém em quatro casos houve associação de diferentes tipos virais na mesma lesão. A positividade dos métodos não estava associada à presença ou ausência de atipias coilocitóticas. Quando se considerou a positividade para um ou outro método, a detecção do vírus ocorreu em 63, 9 % dos casos. A alto índice de detecção relaciona o papilomavírus humano com estas lesões, em especial o tipo 16 / 18, principalmente em grupos etários mais jovens. A ampla faixa etária de distribuição dos casos de neoplasia intraepitelial vulvar grau lU, sugere que o seu tempo de evolução é longo, demonstrando a importância do exame da vulva no exame ginecológico de rotina para melhor detecção e tratamento precoce das lesões.;;Abstract:Recently, {{an increase}} {{has been observed}} {{in the frequency of}} diagnosis of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade III, special 1 y in young women. Studies in gynecologic cancer suggest that hwnan papillomavirus infections {{play an important role in}} the epithelial neoplastic transfOlmation. Between 1983 and 1992, 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and six cases of vulvar carcinoma stage Ia were analysed. The research for the common antigen of the viral capsid was done by the immunoperoxidase technique. The virus types were identified by the "in situ" hybridization technique, with biotinylated probes for HPV 6 / 11, 16 / 18 and 31 / 35 / 51. The mean age ofthe patients with vulvat. int:raepithelial neoplasia was 47, 5 years an the ones with vulvar carcinoma stage Ia, 61, I years. Histologically, <b>koilocytotic</b> <b>atypia</b> was observed in 83, 3 % of the cases. The. immunoperoxidase teclmique was positive in 36, 1 % of the cases, with the mean age of 39, 1 years. The detection of the virus by "in situ" hybridization occurred in 41, 7 % of the cases, with mean age of 38, 3 years. AlI the positive cases had the virus type 16 / 18, but in four of them there was association with other virus types in the same lesion. The positivity of these techniques was not related to the presence or absence of koiIocytotic atypia. When the positivity for one or the other method was considered, virus detection occulTed in 63, 9 % of the cases. This high rate of detection shows a relationship of the human papillomavirus with these vulvar Iesions, specially with type 16 / 18 and in younger age groups. The wide age range distribution of the vulvar intraepithelial neopIasia grade lU patients, suggests that its evolution is long, showing the importance of the vulvar region in routine gynecologic examination, to allow early detection and treatment of these lesions...|$|E
