40|$|The goats {{raised in}} the barn are usually fed on fresh grass. As <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> can be stored for long periods in large amounts, <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding makes it {{possible}} to feed large numbers of goats in barns. This review explains the physiological factors involved in suppressing <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake and the cause of drinking following <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. Ruminants consume an enormous amount of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> in a short time. Eating rates of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> rapidly decreased in the first 40 min of feeding and subsequently declined gradually to low states in the remaining time of the feeding period. Saliva in large-type goats is secreted in large volume during the first hour after the commencement of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. It was elucidated that the marked suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake during the first hour was caused by a feeding-induced hypovolemia and the loss of NaHCO 3 due to excessive salivation during the initial stages of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. On the other hand, it was indicated that the marked decrease in feed intake observed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period was related to ruminal distension caused by the feed consumed and the copious amount of saliva secreted during <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. In addition, results indicate that the marked decreases in <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake after 40 min of feeding are caused by increases in plasma osmolality and subsequent thirst sensations produced by <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. After 40 min of the 2 h <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding period, the feed salt content is absorbed into the rumen and plasma osmolality increases. The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 6 % of the suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake 40 min after the start of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality are the main physiological factors in suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake in large-type goats. There was very little drinking behavior observed during the first hour of the 2 h feeding period most water consumption occurring in the second hour. The cause of this thirst sensation during the second hour of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding period was not hypovolemia brought about by excessive salivation, but rather increases in plasma osmolality due to the ruminal absorption of salt from the consumed feed.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether or not marked decreases in <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake after 40 min of feeding are mainly caused by the two factors, that is, ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality induced thirst produced by <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. Six large-type male esophageal- and ruminal-fistulated goats (crossbred Japanese Saanen/Nubian, aged 2 to 6 years, weighing 85. 1 Â± 4. 89 kg) were used in two experiments. The animals were fed ad libitum a diet of roughly crushed alfalfa hay cubes for 2 h from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 am during two experiments. Water was withheld during feeding in both experiments but was available for a period of 30 min after completion of the 2 h feeding period. In experiment 1, saliva lost via the esophageal fistula was replenished by an intraruminal infusion of artificial parotid saliva (RIAPS) in sham feeding conditions (SFC) control, and the treatment was maintained under normal feeding conditions (NFC). In experiment 2, a RIAPS and non-insertion of a balloon (RIAPS-NB) control was conducted in the same manner as the SFC control of experiment 1. The intraruminal infusion of hypertonic solution and insertion of a balloon (RIHS-IB) treatment was carried out simultaneously to reproduce the effects of changing salt content and ruminal distension due to feed entering the rumen. The results of experiment 1 showed that due to the effects of multiple <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> suppressing factors when feed boluses entered the rumen, eating rates in the NFC treatment decreased (p< 0. 05) after 40 min of feeding and cumulative <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake for the 2 h feeding period reduced to 43. 8 % of the SFC control (p< 0. 01). The results of experiment 2 indicated that due to the two suppressing factors of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality induced thirst, eating rates in the RIHS-IB treatment were, as observed under NFC, reduced (p< 0. 05) and cumulative <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake for the 2 h feeding period decreased to 34. 0 % of the RIAPS-NB control (p< 0. 01).

In the 5 -cut system similar effects were seen {{in the first year}} only. This diversity effect was associated with a reduction in WSC and NEL concentrations and an increase in ADF, NDF and CP concentrations in the grass species, and not in red clover, when grown in mixtures.

The aim of our interdisciplinary {{project was to}} generate basic knowledge on plant management, feed palatability and the antiparasitic properties of tanniferous forage plants for their practical application in agronomy, focusing on their usefulness in controlling gastrointestinal nematodes in organic farming. We found that Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) and Cichorium intybus (chicory) were suitable for cultivation under the given temperate climatic conditions, whereas Lotus pedunculatus (big trefoil) was soon outcompeted by unsown species. Growing the tanniferous plant species in a mixture with Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) {{rather than in a}} monoculture had the advantage of increasing total dry matter (DM) yield (especially in the case of tanniferous legumes) and of reducing the DM proportions of unsown species. However, due to dilution by non-tanniferous F. pratensis, the tannin concentrations of mixtures were clearly lower and the seasonal fluctuations in tannin concentrations greater than that of monocultures. Across species, tannin concentrations were highest for O. viciifolia, followed by L. corniculatus and very low for C. intybus. Palatability of all tanniferous forages was comparable to that of a ryegrass/clover mixture when fed as <b>dried</b> <b>forage</b> and, when offered as silage, palatability of O. viciifolia was clearly superior to that of the respective ryegrass/clover control.

Four trials were conducted at the University of Pretoria Research Farm and analyses were carried out at the Nutrition laboratory of the University of Pretoria. Leucaena forage contained enough nutrients to allow it to be used as a substitute for OSCM and to a large extent was also the source of protein and roughage in the TMR. The leaves of Leucaena had a higher crude protein, mineral and mimosine concentration but lower fibre content than the pods and twigs; while the air dried Leucaena forage had a higher crude protein and lower fibre content than sun <b>dried</b> <b>forage.</b> This study showed that there was a higher crude protein and mimosine concentration but a lower fibre concentration from the Leucaena harvested in summer than that harvested in autumn. Milk yield and quality was not adversely affected by the inclusion of Leucaena in the milk goat diet at the rate of 25 % of the DM, with the exception of milk urea nitrogen. The inclusion of Leucaena decreased the milk urea nitrogen as compared to that shown from TMR without Leucaena. The body weight and body condition of lactating goats were also not affected by inclusion of Leucaena during the three phases of the lactation period. Therefore, the inclusion of Leucaena in the milk goat diet has been shown to support production of milk in terms of yield and quality which was similar to that of goats fed a commercial diet. There was no significant difference in milk composition in terms of milk lactose and milk protein for milk produced in the morning and afternoon between goats fed the two diets, even though the morning milk yield was higher than the afternoon yield because of the unequal milking intervals. However, the milk composition in terms of milk urea nitrogen, milk fat and somatic cell counts varied greatly between morning and afternoon milking. The apparent digestibility, average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of Saanen male goats were not affected by the inclusion of Leucaena in the TMR, as compared to the TMR without Leucaena. However the voluntary dry matter and nutrients intake were improved by the inclusion of Leucaena in the TMR. No toxicity of mimosine was observed during this study. The results of this study also showed that the inclusion of Leucaena in the total mixed ration had no effect on the carcass characteristics and meat quality of goats as compared to those fed a TMR containing OSCM.

To get the full text please contact the other at Abusuwar @ yahoo. comA field experiment was conducted for two consecutive seasons (1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99) at the Demonstration Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Shabmat. The objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of seedbed types in heavy clay soils and the effect of phosphorus fertilizer on growth and seed yield of clitoria (Clitoria ternata L.). The treatments consisted of two types of seedbeds (flat vs. ridged) and three doses of phosphorus (0, 50, and 100 kg P 205 /ha). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Phosphorus fertilizer increased plant density, <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield, seed yield components and total seed yield.

For this purpose, total of 36 sampling plots made of 1 m 2 size cages with of {{with the help}} of wire fences were established at 1900, 2000 and 2200 m altitudes. Vegetation samples taken from these cages were first identified and classified into botanical composition and then their fresh and <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield were estimated along with their grazing capacity. In addition, total of 72 undisturbed and disturbed soil samples taken from 0 - 20 cm depth were analyzed for permeability, bulk density, content of fine particles and soil skeleton, root amount, texture, particle density, porosity, organic matter (OM) and soil pH. According to the estimated results, the mean fresh forage yield was determined as 647. 22 kg/da, the mean <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield was estimated to be 196. 67 kg/da. It was determined that the botanical composition was made up of % 46. 16 poaceae (gramineae), % 14. 36 leguminosae (fabaceae) and % 39. 45 other families and showed some significant differences among the elevation gradients. In addition, some properties of soils including OM, bulk density, the contents of fine particles, soil skeleton and porosity displayed significant differences between the altitudes in the pasturelands.

Significant {{differences were found in}} water-use efficiency among cultivars in both the seedling and mature stages of plant development. Cultivars did not maintain their rank between the stages of plant development in either water-use efficiency or dry matter production. Plants of Mesa-Sirsa transpired more water than those of other cultivars in both experiments. Significant differences were found among plants of different cultivars in <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> and transpired water in the seedling stage; however, no significant differences for these factors were found among cultivars in the mature stage of plant development.

The objective {{of this study was}} to clarify which factor produced when feed boluses enter the rumen is mainly responsible for the marked increase in water intake in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period in large-type goats fed on <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> for 2 h twice daily. Six large-type male esophageal- and ruminal-fistulated goats (crossbred Japanese Saanen/Nubian, aged 2 to 6 years, weighing 85. 1 Â± 4. 89 kg) were used in two experiments. In experiment 1, the water deprivation (WD) control and the water availability (WA) treatment were conducted to compare changes in water intake during and after <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. In experiment 2, a normal feeding conditions (NFC) control and a feed bolus removal (FBR) treatment were carried out to investigate whether decrease in circulating plasma volume or increase in plasma osmolality is mainly responsible for the marked increase in water intake in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. The results of experiment 1 showed that in the WA treatment, small amounts of water were consumed during the first hour of feeding while the majority of water intake was observed during the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. Therefore, the amounts of water consumed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period accounted for 82. 8 % of the total water intake. The results of experiment 2 indicated that in comparison with the NFC control, decrease in plasma volume in the FBR treatment, which was indicated by increase in hematocrit and plasma total protein concentrations, was higher (p< 0. 05) in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. However, plasma osmolality in the FBR treatment was lower (p< 0. 05) than compared to the NFC control from 30 min after the start of feeding. Therefore, thirst level in the FBR treatment was 82. 7 % less (p< 0. 01) compared with that in the NFC control upon conclusion of the 30 min drinking period. The results of the study indicate that the increased plasma osmolality in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period is the main physiological stimulating factor of water intake during and after <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding in large-type goats...|$|R
