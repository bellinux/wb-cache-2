50|$|The Egyptian Club, {{also known}} as Egyptian Room and {{referred}} to colloquially as <b>E-Room,</b> was a lesbian bar in the Richmond neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, United States, operating from 1995 to 2010. Owner Kim Davis re-opened the venue as Weird Bar in October 2010, but the all-inclusive establishment closed within a year.|$|E
40|$|Devoll {{hydropower}} {{project is}} planned {{in a southern}} part of Albania. We focused mostly on optimizing of excavation options, lining design and cost of lining. The chosen alternative for this study is Tomorrice HEP (NC 4) among several other alternatives. We have taken information from previous studies, available data, laboratory investigations, site visits in Albania, meeting and discussing with consultants from Norway, Austria and Germany, access to <b>e-room</b> (online). As most investigations are still pending so not enough data was available, but we have used whatever information was in our access. From the desk study and geological reports {{we have tried to}} establish a overview of ground conditions. Understanding geotechnical conditions leaded us to decide about excavation methods to be used, their efficiency and risks involving ground conditions. Rock mass was found to be poor to fair so rock support measures are suggested accordingly. TBM method was selected as main excavation method and Double shield TBM is recommended. Lining design is carried out by using the suggestions given by Viglconsult. Lining parameters are recalculated using analytical method. Numerical analysis approach has also been adopted and lining design analysis is done by using FEM program called Phase 2 V 7. 0. The results of both approaches fit together quite well. Precast lining segment production method and proposed factory are studied. Cost estimation for excavation methods and lining are also discussed briefly. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ground centers {{operators}} present {{special training}} and knowledge transfer requirements {{due to their}} operating environment. Typical characteristics are distributed skills with different specializations that shall interact efficiently to reach the goal. Learning environment should continuously collect any new information and any lesson learnt should be quickly reflected into operations. The current approach is mainly based on classroom training and simulations. Classroom training is efficient {{to build up a}} basic knowledge required for all positions. Simulations provide essential skills in practical or emergency situations. What is missing or is expensive to implement is lessons specialization for individual skills and simulation lessons learnt dissemination. Practical experience during training and simulations demonstrate that most operators are willing to share knowledge. The limited overlapping of their specializations and skills is helping the process because cooperation is more important than competition. Most training and knowledge transfer information is spread over many channels as e-mail, <b>e-room</b> reports, memos, presentations and so on. Cooperation is then limited in scope. What should change the situation is a set-up of a common infrastructure where information is distributed and managed using a social approach, pushing forward the implementation of collaboration groups. Facebook-like profiles and groups are information hubs where operators discuss. Wikis are used to assemble and maintain knowledge. Tweets allow short information broadcasting. All the information is classified and continuously verified by all the operators; training responsibles are acting as facilitators and administrators of knowledge. In conclusion, the project aims at providing an efficient knowledge node where information is socially collected, transformed and redistributed. Different processes are used trying to use them efficiently to sort out the operational needs, trying to keep all of them in a single common platform. I...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{collaboration}} as {{a vehicle}} that share information and knowledge within an organisation has been available for many years. Collaboration tools have evolved from e-mail, document management systems, and workflow systems to <b>e-rooms</b> etc. The value of supporting digital collaboration is increasing with complex organizations. Research has revealed some requirements that should be offered in acceptable collaboration tools. These are awareness information, information availability and user-friendliness. Awareness is state- and presence information about participants and artifacts. Information availability is the systems support to relevant information, offered through documents or conversations. Easy-to-reach and easy-to-use are typical parameters in a user-friendly tool. In this thesis I have examined a set of different software products delivered by DNV software, with respect to how these products provide collaboration features. Strength and weaknesses are revealed, and possible improvements are pointed out. An examination of pros and cons with different collaboration platform solutions; collaboration features {{as part of a}} framework or as application specific features, is carried out. This platform examination and the many similarities in collaboration needs, support a proposed design where collaboration mechanisms are integrated as components in a framework. </p...|$|R
