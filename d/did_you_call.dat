2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E
