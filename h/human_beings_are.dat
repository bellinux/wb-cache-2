5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{seen as a}} {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
40|$|The {{only valid}} {{consideration}} of <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> what takes {{the person in}} his complexity. <b>Human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> an open system in his relation with the medium. But, attending his racionality (deepest and most radical dimension), <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> free system. So, {{he is able to}} assert oneself ends according values...|$|R
25|$|For example, the {{biological}} half-life {{of water in}} a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> about 9 to 10 days, though this can be altered by behavior and various other conditions. The biological half-life of cesium in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>is</b> between one and four months.|$|R

5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead {{are more or less}} alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> facing {{through the}} technological {{transformation of the}} planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{aware and}} {{are aware of}} being aware - i.e., they are conscious. Human {{consciousness}} always includes an awareness of oneself {{in the context of}} other people.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{language}} is that certain nouns change depending upon whether there is one, two, or three of the object. For instance, one <b>human</b> <b>being</b> would <b>be</b> ko:ra or kor, two <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> would <b>be</b> niiyel, and three <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> would <b>be</b> nahkseyt.|$|R

25|$|This {{question}} was, {{in large}} part, {{prompted by the}} Tendai concept of original enlightenment (本覚 hongaku), which states that all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.|$|E

25|$|Post-Han Daoism {{expanded}} {{the notion of}} ganying far beyond the basic Huainanzi (above) ideas that historical events result from mutual resonance between {{different parts of the}} universe, and that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> agents of mutual resonance who participate fully in the creative transformations of Dao (Le Blanc 1985: 110).|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í Faith {{emphasizes}} {{the unity of}} humanity. To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the prophets were sent by God to facilitate this.|$|E
25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{expected}} {{to live on}} average 30–40 years in Swaziland and 82.6 years in Japan, but the latter's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn. An analysis published in 2011 in The Lancet attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities and public health as well as diet.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{lacking in}} the natural weapons possessed by other predators, humans {{have a long history}} of making tools to {{overcome}} this shortcoming. The evolution of hunting weapons shows an ever-increasing ability to extend the hunter's reach, while maintaining the ability to produce disabling or lethal wounds, allowing the hunter to capture the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{rational}} and human behavior {{is guided by}} reason is an old one. However, recent research (on satisficing for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favour of a more bounded rationality. The field of behavioural economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{terrestrial}} {{and most}} of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.|$|E
