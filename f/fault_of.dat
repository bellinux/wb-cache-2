5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great anguish in the hierarchy of the RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E

5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
30|$|The <b>fault</b> system <b>of</b> Liaodong Bay {{developed}} extensively {{under the}} control <b>of</b> the Tanlu <b>Fault.</b> The fault system can be grouped into strike-slip <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I, trunk <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade II and branch <b>faults</b> (induced <b>faults)</b> <b>of</b> grade III respectively based on its developmental scale. The <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I and II were deep, early and large while the <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade III were shallow, late and small. The formation, evolution and distribution features {{played a significant role}} in controlling the migration of oil and gas in both horizontal and vertical directions. The fluid transfer in the fault system occurred in the process <b>of</b> <b>faulting.</b> The strike-slip and trunk faults moved actively forming predominant pathways for oil and gas migration. The branch faults, with weak activity, generally controlled the development of traps and were beneficial for the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas. The <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I and II formed the major migration pathways for oil and gas, but their fault activity rates appeared to vary along their strikes. The zones with a relatively low fault activity rate might be favorable for oil and gas accumulation. When the activities of strike-slip, trunk, and branch faults came to a halt, the fault seal behavior had a vitally important effect on the accumulation of oil and gas. The controlling role <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> over fluid distribution was further analyzed by calculating the fault activity quantitatively.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E

Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster.

40|$|International audienceThe topical {{problem of}} {{effective}} verification of digital circuits of different physical systems remains a hot topic. Devices ranging from embedded components to perform specific tasks or experiments to modern communication clusters used for data transmission are concerned. The method of {{synthesis of the}} test sequences is based on injection <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> into a reference circuit and deriving a corresponding distinguishing sequence which detects this fault. The method is known as mutation testing and is widely used for the synthesis of high-quality verification tests for digital circuits. Naturally, test suits that detect <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> various classes, and larger amount <b>of</b> <b>faults,</b> are <b>of</b> greater interest. The paper studies the correlation between different test suits derived for different mutant types. The considered fault types include 1) single stuck-at faults, 2) bridges, and 3) hardly detectable faults, i. e., slightly modifying {{the behavior of a}} single circuit gate. Tests for detecting <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> each type are derived for the B 01 -B 10 benchmark package (ITC' 99 benchmarks (Second Release)), which are components of physical systems intended for various applications including processing of data obtained, load balancing systems, etc. Experiments aim to access the <b>fault</b> coverage <b>of</b> the test derived for one mutant type against <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> other types. It is shown experimentally that the synthesis of tests of one type, including a single stuck-at fault test, is insufficient, because its fault coverage for <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> other types cannot exceed 60...|$|R
