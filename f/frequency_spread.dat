50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure the {{received}} waveform (green) is simply a delayed replica of the transmitted waveform (red). The transmitted frequency is used to down-convert the receive signal to baseband, {{and the amount of}} frequency shift between the transmit signal and the reflected signal increases with time delay (distance). The time delay is thus a measure of the range; a small <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> is produced by nearby reflections, a larger <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> corresponds with more time delay and a longer range.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Multicarrier code-division {{multiple}} access (CDMA) {{with time and}} <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> has been recently considered {{as a candidate for}} fourth-generation (4 G) wireless systems. This signaling scheme simultaneously utilizes code spreading in the time and frequency domains to simultaneously improve frequency diversity and minimize multiuser access interference. As a result, it is capable of outperforming multicarrier CDMA systems that employ 1 -D spreading. In this paper, a novel adaptive subcar-rier allocation algorithm is developed for multicarrier CDMA with time and <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> to improve the overall bit error rate (BER) performance for all spreading configurations. This algorithm assigns users to subcarrier groups that provide favorable fading characteristics while simultaneously reducing the amount of interference caused to other users. The proposed algo-rithm is shown to provide a performance improvement, ranging from 1. 5 dB with 2 × 16 (time × <b>frequency)</b> and <b>spreading</b> to 7 dB with 16 × 2 (time × <b>frequency)</b> <b>spreading.</b> The algorithm is also shown to maintain or improve the BER floor for each spreading configuration. It is concluded that at higher and lower levels of Eb/No, a higher frequency- and time-domain spreading should be, respectively, employed to improve BER performance. Furthermore, the Eb/No threshold level to switch between time and <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> for the analyzed system is found to be 2. 5 dB.

50|$|EMP events usually {{induce a}} {{corresponding}} signal in the victim equipment, due to coupling between {{the source and}} victim. Coupling usually occurs most strongly over a relatively narrow frequency band, leading to a characteristic damped sine wave signal in the victim. Visually it is shown as a high frequency sine wave growing and decaying within the longer-lived envelope of the double-exponential curve. A damped sinewave typically has much lower energy and a narrower <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> than the original pulse, due to the transfer characteristic of the coupling mode. In practice, EMP test equipment often injects these damped sinewaves directly rather than attempting to recreate the high-energy threat pulses.|$|E
5000|$|The MDV {{comes from}} the <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> of the {{mainlobe}} clutter. MDV determines whether traffic will be detected. A GMTI radar must distinguish a moving target from ground clutter by using the target’s Doppler signature to detect the radial component of the target’s velocity vector (i.e., by measuring the component of the target’s movement directly along the radar-target line). To capture most of this traffic, {{even when it is}} moving almost tangentially to the radar (i.e., perpendicular to the radar-target line), a system must have the ability to detect very slow radial velocities. As the radial component of a target’s velocity approaches zero, the target will fall into the clutter or blind zone. This is calculated as: ...|$|E

40|$|International audience—The {{topic of}} {{physical}} layer key agreement in Gaus-sian block fading channels {{in the presence}} of active adversaries is investigated in the present contribution. Frequency hopping versus <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> are studied as potential defence strategies against denial of service (DoS) attacks in the form of jamming. We begin by investigating the optimal power allocation policy for the jammer – in the case of <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> – when side information is available. Through numerical evaluations it is shown that effect of the availability of side information on the jammer's impact is minimal. Next, the competitive interaction between the legitimate nodes and the jammer is formulated as a one-shot zero-sum game; it is found that under short term power constraints, the legitimate nodes should optimally employ frequency hopping while the jammer should employ <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading.</b> Comparing the achievable secret key generation rates in systems with and without frequency hopping demonstrates that increasing the available bandwidth can diminish the limitations of secret key generation {{in the presence of}} active adversaries.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in the present underwater acoustic communication systems is to combat the underwater channel effects which results in time and <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> of the transmitted signal. The time spreading {{is caused by the}} multipath effect while the <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> is due to the time variability of the underwater channel. The passive Time Reversal (pTR) equalizer has been used in underwater communications because of its time focusing property which minimizes the time spreading effect of the underwater channel. In order to compensate for the <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> effect, an improved version of pTR was proposed, called Frequency shift passive time reversal (FSpTR). FSpTR tries to compensate for the <b>frequency</b> <b>spreading</b> by applying a frequency shift in the estimated channel impulse response (IR). In the multipath environment, multiple replicas of the transmitted signal reaches the receiver through different paths where each path is affected differently by environmental variations. In such cases, a single frequency shift fails to compensate for the environmental variations on each path, resulting in degradation in the performance. In this paper, an arrival-based equalizer is proposed to compensate for the environmental variations on each path. The concept of beamforming is integrated with FSpTR equalizer, in this paper, to compensate each arrival separately for the environmental variations. The proposed equalizer is tested with the real data and the results showed that the proposed approach outperforms pTR and FSpTR equalizers and provides a mean MSE gain of 4. 9 dB and 4. 2 dB respectively.

40|$|High Q mirror {{suspensions}} are a {{key element}} of the advanced interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In December 2002 the last of the final interferometer optics of GEO 600 were monolithically suspended, using fused silica fibres. The violin modes of the suspension fibres can have Q greater than 10 (8) and can therefore interfere with the interferometer length control servo. Hence, the violin modes need to be damped, without degrading the pendulum Q itself. Furthermore, the <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> of the fibres used has to be small to allow for high Q notch filtering in the length control servo. ne requirements for the violin modes of the two GEO 600 inboard suspensions are Q lt 3 x 10 (6) for the fundamental and Q lt 2 x 10 (6) for the first harmonic mode, respectively. The <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> should not exceed 10 % within one mode. To accomplish that, two sections of the fibres were coated with amorphous Teflon. By applying the coating, the Q of the relevant modes can be degraded to the desired values and furthermore, the frequencies of these modes can be tuned almost independently with a good accuracy over a wide range. After welding the fibres in the monolithic suspension, a corrective coating was applied to some fibres, to compensate for the <b>frequency</b> <b>spread</b> due to the tension spread of the four fibres within a suspension.
