During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said that was the way she wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress.

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

Down this strange, old-world corridor I stumbled, my feeble flame throwing a dim circle of light around me, which made the shadows beyond the more threatening and obscure. Finally, I came to a spot where the Roman tunnel opened into a water-worn cavern--a huge hall, hung with long white icicles of lime deposit.

It {{is considered by}} many to be the best representation of their [...] "classic" [...] sound, and songs such as [...] "Lucky the Donkey," [...] "Do the Hustle," [...] "Lipstick" [...] and [...] "Perfect World" [...] became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> guilty [...] What <b>I</b> would do <b>is</b> grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later.

500|$|Although the NHL had not {{suspended}} Richards for {{his actions}} against Booth, the incident {{was instrumental in the}} League's newfound efforts to eliminate hits to the head, particularly against players who cannot see the oncoming checker approaching (as was the case with Booth). Several months after Booth's October 2009 concussion, Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard was hit by Matt Cooke in a similar fashion on March 7. Later that month, on March 25, the NHL Board of Governors and NHL Players' Association's executive board voted in favour of a rule penalizing [...] "blindside hits" [...] (bodychecking a player after having skated laterally towards him undetected, an idea similar to one's [...] "blind spot" [...] while driving). That same night, Booth suffered his second concussion in five months during a game against the Montreal Canadiens. While reaching back to retrieve a loose puck, Booth was hit in the head by opposing defenceman Jaroslav Špaček's shoulder. No penalty was called on the play, while Booth was helped off the ice and taken to hospital. The hit did not receive suspension and did not spark controversy as Booth's previous concussion had. Following the game, Panthers forward Nathan Horton asserted that [...] "It wasn't a dirty hit"; Špaček expressed concern for Booth, but explained that [...] "when he turned <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> right <b>there</b> and basically he just ran at me." [...] Sidelined for the remaining nine games of the season, Booth finished the campaign with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) over 28 games. After pushing for a playoff spot the previous season, the Panthers ranked second-worst in the East with 32 wins and 77 points.|$|R

I also grow beans, tomatoes cabbages and sukuma wiki. [Kale] Kadenge 	Well that sounds like quite a large variety of crops. Now next to us is a tree that has got some bright and broad looking leaves. Let's start with this one. What tree is this? Wangui	This one is an avocado tree. I have two trees and they give me fruit, which I sell and get some money. Kadenge 	Okay let's move on now to these other smaller looking trees. What trees are these? Wangui	This one is the apple tree. It has been grafted and it gives me fruit as you can see them and I sell them. Now they have been flowering. You can see some have got fruits also they have got flowers. You can see that there are no weeds. So I always pull the weeds so that they can do the flowering nearly all the year round. Kadenge 	And what fruit is this that we have here right now? Could you just pluck one? Wangui	Guavas. They <b>are</b> fruits, <b>I</b> also sell some and children use the others. Kadenge 	Okay. And this certainly looks like a mango tree is it? Wangui	Yes it is a mango tree. It has now taken two years, but it has not started giving fruit because it was not grafted this one. It failed the first time but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> planning to do it again. If I graft it, it will give me fruits soon. Kadenge 	Now are all your fruit trees grafted or some of them are not? Wangui	No they are all grafted - all of them. Kadenge 	And what was the reason for grafting them? Wangui	To make them start flowering soon instead of taking long time so they flower quickly when they are grafted than when they are not grafted. Kadenge 	Now earlier on we saw some cows just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> entering your farm and you have talked about manure. Do you get your manure from the cows? Wangui	Yes. I get a lot of manure from those cows because I have zero grazing so I get a lot of manure from there. Kadenge 	And do you mix the manure from with cow with any other manure - maybe from the vegetation on the farm? Wangui	Yes I do because I have got a compost pit so I get the manure from there. Afterwards I put some weeds and all the leaves, the dry leaves, and so I mix them and then spread them on my farm. Kadenge 	Okay let?s walk {{over to the other side}} of the farm. Now we are walking down to an area where there are eucalyptus trees being grown, but just before we get there, we have some grass here. What grass is this? Wangui	This is Napier grass which I use to feed my cows. Kadenge 	I notice that in between the Napier grass there are some small seedlings. What trees are these? Wangui	Grevillea. Kadenge 	And what is the benefit - why are you planting this tree on your farm? Wangui	They give food to the cows and also it helps my farm - I have planted it where it is not very fertile. Kadenge 	So it also is able to enrich the soil fertility? Wangui 	Yes it is. Kadenge 	Okay let?s move nearer to the eucalyptus trees. Wangui	Yes these are the ones which I have planted on half an acre. Kadenge 	And the benefits of the eucalyptus to you? Wangui	They grow very fast and also they will give timber and also firewood and that <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> have planted them. Kibuika	My names <b>are</b> John Kibuika. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an extension officer in Kikuyu division. So my work is to co-ordinate extension activities in the division whereby there are livestock, there are crops, that are grown and all rely on extension. Of course when I mean crop/livestock farming it also encompasses agroforestry. Kadenge 	Yes, in fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to mention right now I can see something that looks like a seed bed. Could you just explain to us what little trees <b>I</b> <b>am</b> seeing here are and some of their benefits? Kibuika	We have a number of different type of trees. Like we have the Grevillea robusta. They are fast growing, they are also very good for wood. They also provide the foliage part of it. The leafy part of it are fed to the animals during the dry period whereby we have nothing to give to our animals. They are also very good in soil fertility because of their leaves fall quite frequently and they decompose very fast. So they also improve soil fertility. We also have another tree called the neem tree, which are good for medicinal value. They prevent and also heal malaria and other diseases. We have the Eucalyptus, the blue gums, which are very fast growing especially this variety from South Africa which grow within five years, they mature within five years. And we get poles from them, also they are very good for charcoal and they are also very important in preventing soil erosion. Kadenge 	And so are you involved in making sure that such nursery beds are taken well care of and made in the right way? Kibuika	That is actually our work. We had a demonstration sometime back whereby we showed them the way to go about making a nursery just from the beginning. The way to lay a nursery bed, filling the poly tubes and of course even transferring the small seedlings to the poly tubes and of course even the watering and caring for them. End of track.

6000|$|... "I {{was once}} in an obelisk-ship," [...] said he, [...] "that used to trade regular between Egypt and New York, {{carrying}} obelisks. We {{had a big}} obelisk on board. The way they ship obelisks {{is to make a}} hole in the stern of the ship, and run the obelisk in, p'inted end foremost; and this obelisk filled up nearly the whole of that ship from stern to bow. We was about ten days out, and sailing afore a northeast gale with the engines at full speed, when suddenly we spied breakers ahead, and our Captain saw we was about to run on a bank. Now if we hadn't had an obelisk on board we might have sailed over that bank, but the captain knew that with an obelisk on board we drew too much water for this, and that we'd be wrecked in about fifty-five seconds if something wasn't done quick. So he had to do something quick, {{and this is what he}} did: He ordered all steam on, and drove slam-bang on that bank. Just as he expected, we stopped so suddint that that big obelisk bounced for'ard, its p'inted end foremost, and went clean through the bow and shot out into the sea. The minute it did that the vessel was so lightened that it rose in the water and we easily steamed over the bank. There was one man knocked overboard by the shock when we struck, but as soon as we missed him we went back after him and we got him all right. You see, when that obelisk went overboard, its butt-end, which was heaviest, went down first, and when it touched the bottom it just stood there, and as it was such a big obelisk there was about five and a half feet of it stuck out of the water. The man who was knocked overboard he just swum for that obelisk and he climbed up the hiryglyphics. It was a mighty fine obelisk, and the Egyptians had cut their hiryglyphics good and deep, so that the man could get hand and foot-hold; and when we got to him and took him off, he was sitting high and dry on the p'inted end of that obelisk. It was a great pity about the obelisk, for it was a good obelisk, but as I never heard the company tried to raise it, <b>I</b> expect it <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> yet." ...|$|R
