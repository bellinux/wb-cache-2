The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> report.|$|E

Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> concluded with that there were costs of NOK300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report {{was rejected by the}} board, who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and that the Public Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll collection agency. Øyvind Halleraker withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005. He was at the time also member of parliament for the Conservative Party.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study {{attempts}} {{to articulate the}} conceptual foundations {{of the role of}} <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in corporate governance by drawing on Michel Foucault’s concept of governmentality. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a literature-based analysis of the role of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> from a Foucauldian perspective. Findings – It is argued that Foucault’s notion of governmentality provides conceptual tools for researching <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> as a disciplinary mechanism in the corporate governance setting of contemporary organizations. The paper develops an initial conceptual formulation of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> as (a) ex post assurance about the execution of economic activities within management’s preconceived frameworks and (b) ex ante advisory services to enhance the rationality of economic activities and accompanying controls. Originality/value – This paper extends the Foucauldian analysis of accounting to incorporate <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> It offers original propositions as a research agenda and discusses ontological and epistemic considerations associated with adopting the Foucauldian framework for <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> research.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in municipalities in Israel, as perceived by different groups of users. A model to evaluate effectiveness was developed, followed by the preparation of a self-administered questionnaire of the Likert type. After pilot testing, the questionnaire was despatched. The empirical study was conducted on the majority of Israeli municipalities that possess an <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> unit. The respondent groups also included journalists at local newspapers who cover the annual municipality <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> reports. The returned questionnaires provided the data used in the research analysis. After factor analysis, the model emerged based on the following components: Independence, Competence, Scope of work, Performance of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> unit, and the Implementation of corrective action following the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> findings. The respondents were divided into five groups: (1) Staff of the municipality <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> unit (2) Councillors - elected by the public (3) Top management (4) Middle level management (5) Journalists. Meetings were also held with the mayors of various municipalities to ascertain their opinions on the results of the data analysis. The research findings revealed major differences in the evaluation of effectiveness between different groups of users. In general, the research shows that the closer the user stands to the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> operation, the higher the evaluation. The implementation of corrective action following the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> findings was rated by all the respondent groups as lower than the other components. Another result is that the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> unit tends to be perceived as less effective in smaller municipalities; for this comparison, municipalities were divided into three categories according to population size. The research has yielded various recommendations for operational change in order to improve the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in municipalities.

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{conceptual}} framework for auditing to guide the development of auditing standards and practice on a consistent and theoretically sound basis has been recognised by many practitioners and academicians. This need seems to be even stronger {{in the case of}} <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> Thus, one major objective of the research is to take a step towards developing a widely accepted conceptual model that encompass the different concepts, identify the main objectives, define the functions, and explain the different interrelationships that exist within <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> This follows a rigorous review of literature and theoretical background to set the research terms. It is imperative that the attempt to develop the model should be accompanied by empirical study concerned with its applicability. Thus, the model is then used to examine how internal auditors working in developing countries perceive <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> As well as, examining the standard of practice of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in developing countries. Two questionnaires are developed and used as the research instruments. The first questionnaire is used to collect data on the perception of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing,</b> and the second is used to collect data on the practice of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> Factor analysis is then applied to data collected to explore the relationship between the different statements included in the questionnaires. The empirical chapters consider: significant perceptual differences between different levels of internal auditors; significant perceptual differences between internal auditors working in the public and private sectors; significant differences in the practice of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> between public and private sectors. Main findings indicate that: the perception of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> is significantly influenced by the level and experience of internal auditors; the perception of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> is significantly influenced by the sector in which internal auditors work; the practice of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> varies significantly between the public and private sectors; generally positive perception among all respondents of what is promoted by the conceptual framework; the practice of internal auaiting in developing countries still lags behind what is promoted by the conceptual framework...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{investigated}} why <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> mechanisms fail {{to detect and}} prevent common risks especially fraud and corruption risks in Thai local governments. The crucial causes of ineffectiveness of those systems were ascertained through 415 questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with 36 Thai local government internal auditors. Statistical techniques were used for analysing the questionnaires while content analysis and a phenomenological research approach based on Bandura’s theory of moral disengagement were used for analysing the interview transcripts. The results revealed that corruption methods used in Thai local governments generated factors which, in turn, generated ineffectiveness in <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> mechanisms in detecting and deterring risks. The corruption methods contributed {{to a lack of}} independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> systems; a lack of officials’ cooperation with <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> teams; a lack of efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> processes; a lack of support from administrators; a lack of interest of officials to internal control system; and a lack of promotion prospects. A lack of competency of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> teams also contributed to the inefficiency of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> systems. The Office of the Auditor General of Thailand (OAG) is implicit in the ineffectiveness because of its failure to use audit reports of local government to assess risks within local governments. Other related factors are concerned with the auditors’ personal behaviours designed to ensure their wellbeing and survival needs. The failure of Thai federal authorities to enforce their laws and regulations and to detect and deter corruption in their own ranks must be addressed before local government <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> processes can be effective...|$|R
