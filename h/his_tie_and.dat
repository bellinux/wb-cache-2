500|$|Wenger {{appointed}} Vieira as club captain following Adams' retirement, {{and made}} few additions to his double-winning squad, signing defender Pascal Cygan, midfielder Gilberto Silva and utility player Kolo Touré. He was confident his side would retain {{the league and}} told the media: [...] "Nobody will finish above us in the league. It wouldn't surprise me {{if we were to}} go unbeaten for the whole of the season". Arsenal set a new top-flight record in their opening game of the 2002–03 season; a 2–0 victory against Birmingham City was their 14th league win in succession. They continued their fine start by overhauling Nottingham Forest's top-flight record of 22 away league matches without defeat and later surpassed Manchester United's Premier League total of 29 matches unbeaten. Arsenal lost to Everton in October 2002, which began a run of four matches without a win. Though Wenger's team built an eight-point lead over challengers Manchester United by March 2003, they were overhauled in the final weeks of the season. [...] The title race shifted in United's favour when Bolton Wanderers came from behind to draw 2–2 against Arsenal. Wenger showed moments of exasperation during the match by loosening <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> bellowing orders from the touchline. Journalist Phil McNulty wrote that Wenger's demeanor [...] "spoke of someone who had the title in his grasp but now saw it slipping from his fingers". Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0 to retain the FA Cup {{at the end of the}} campaign.|$|E
60|$|Psmith {{straightened}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> clicked his tongue, disappointed.|$|E
60|$|Norris Vine {{was busy}} tying <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for a}} moment until he had {{arranged}} it to his satisfaction. Then he turned round.|$|E
50|$|Frustrated {{with a lack}} of {{progress}} on the representative scene, Pickup felt he was a victim of his Rugby League heritage <b>and</b> stubbornly severed <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> set off to England on a working holiday, and would not return to Australia until 1972.|$|R
50|$|On 7 August 2015, Herrera {{terminated}} {{his contract}} with the Valencian club and signed a one-year deal with UD Almería nine days later. On 1 February 2016, however, he severed <b>his</b> <b>ties,</b> <b>and</b> moved to Girona FC also in the second level hours later.|$|R
60|$|Ignatius Gallaher turned <b>his</b> orange <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> slate-blue eyes full {{upon his}} friend.|$|R
60|$|Then Bastin {{retired to}} {{straighten}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> grabbing his coat from Bickley, who {{handed it to}} him with a malicious smile, forced his perspiring arms into it in a peculiarly awkward and elephantine fashion.|$|E
60|$|John {{stood on}} the hearth-rug, {{with his hands in}} his pockets. His morning clothes were {{exceedingly}} well-cut, <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> collar unexceptionable, his hair closely cropped according to the fashion of the moment. He had an extremely civilized air.|$|E
60|$|Archie {{took another}} drink of ice-water to steady his shaking nerve-centers, pulled down his waistcoat, {{straightened}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> then, with {{something of the}} air of a Roman gladiator entering the arena, tottered across the room. Lucille turned to entertain the perplexed music-publisher.|$|E
60|$|Vandyke ruffled his long, black locks, disarranged <b>his</b> {{careless}} <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> {{leaned over}} to Madder.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of these {{high-profile}} cases, Al Sharpton has threatened to boycott the store and has compared its racial profiling to the [...] "Stop-and-Frisk" [...] policy practiced by the NYPD, a practice that was later deemed unconstitutional by a US District Court. Fans have also petitioned Jay-Z to sever <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> partnership with the retailer.|$|R
50|$|Ablyazov {{moved to}} Moscow in 2003 to rebuild <b>his</b> {{business}} <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> in 2005 became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} looking-glass, {{straightened}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> {{made his}} way towards the Ambassador's private apartments. The latter was alone when he entered, seated before his table. He was {{leaning back in his}} chair, however, and apparently deep in thought. He watched Norgate sternly as he crossed the room.|$|E
60|$|Almost as {{he spoke}} Louis entered from the further end of the restaurant. He did not see me, and I noticed that his fingers were {{arranging}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> that as he passed a mirror {{he glanced at his}} shirt-front. When I {{came face to face with}} him he was breathing fast as though he had been running.|$|E
60|$|So {{they left}} me alone, and I {{was not sure}} whether the honours {{remained}} with him or with me. He had never for a moment lost his dignity, nor had he even looked ridiculous when calmly rearranging <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> collar. I laughed to myself bitterly as I prepared to follow them. I was determined to lay the whole matter before the Duke at once.|$|E
60|$|Virginia {{went up to}} Captain Lige, deftly {{twisted into}} shape <b>his</b> black <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed him on the}} check. How his face burned when she touched him.|$|R
2500|$|... wears <b>his</b> cravat loosely <b>tied</b> <b>and</b> {{secured with}} a stickpin, 1847.|$|R
5000|$|On November 15, 2014, Stefanovic {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Fairfax Media that he had been wearing the same suit on-air every day for a year, [...] "except for a couple of times because of circumstance," [...] as what he claimed to be an experiment in sexism. He claims that, while his female colleagues receive regular criticism for whatever they wear, nobody noticed his outfit the whole time. He did, however, vary <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> shirts more regularly than his suit.|$|R
60|$|Platte and the Colonel were {{dressing}} at the Club--both {{late for}} their engagements, and both in a hurry. That was Kismet. The two watches {{were on a}} shelf below the looking-glass--guards hanging down. That was carelessness. Platte changed first, snatched a watch, looked in the glass, settled <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> ran. Forty seconds later, the Colonel did exactly the same thing; each man taking the other's watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{not know}} him before this affair. He's changed tremendously. He used to be neat and comfortable. For the last {{fortnight}} he's been hazy, with a far-away look in his eyes. He preached last Sunday without his cuff links, and something wrong with <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> he took for his text, 'Eye hath not seen nor ear heard.' He really believes all this nonsense about the Angel-land. The man is verging on monomania!" ...|$|E
60|$|Sir John, {{in a quiet}} dark {{travelling}} suit, {{was sitting}} in a pokey little room writing letters. The room was worse than pokey, it was shabby; and the view from the window, of chimney pots and slate roofs, wholly uninspiring. Nevertheless, Sir John had the look {{of a man who was}} enjoying himself. He seemed years younger, and the arrangement of <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> hair were almost rakish. He stamped his last letter as Annabel entered.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{accession}} of Richard II, Isabella's nephew, in August 1377, Enguerrand resigned all of <b>his</b> English <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> possessions. Isabella then died in England under mysterious circumstances, {{separated from}} her husband and eldest daughter, Marie.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{he joined}} Clann na Poblachta, a new party led by Seán MacBride, {{who had been}} an Irish Republican Army officer in Carlow during Dorman-O'Gowan's posting there. <b>His</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> {{allegiance}} to the UK were fading fast. In May 1951 he stood for election to the Dáil as an independent candidate in Cavan, since Clann were already supporting another candidate. He polled just 495 votes - the lowest of the eight candidates. He later became an IRA advisor to the IRA Executive during the 1950s Border Campaign.|$|R
2500|$|... 1971: Pipes and Drums, the Billy Mitchell Scottish, {{was created}} in Milwaukee to honor Mitchell <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to Scotland <b>and</b> Milwaukee.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} about him that made her feel {{that she would have}} liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straighten <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the light of open fires, and make him tell her his inmost thoughts, and stimulate him to do something really worth while with his life; but this, she held, was merely the instinct of a generous nature to be kind and helpful even to a comparative stranger.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the swing}} doors, almost as Brightman had {{concluded}} his speech, came Jocelyn Thew. He {{was dressed in}} light tweeds, carefully fashioned by an English tailor. <b>His</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> collar, his grey Homburg hat with its black band, his beautifully polished and not too new brown shoes, were exactly according to the decrees of Bond Street. He seemed to be making {{his way to the}} bar, but at the sight of them he paused and strolled across the room towards them.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned and}} studied him. Helen, who had strolled {{a few yards}} away, was knee-deep in the golden brown bracken, picking some gorgeously {{coloured}} leaves from a solitary bramble bush. Lessingham had thrown his cap onto the ground, and his wind-tossed hair and the unusual colour in his cheeks were both, in their way, becoming. His loose but well-fitting country clothes, <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> soft collar, were all well-chosen and suitable. She admired his high forehead and his firm, rather proud mouth. His eyes {{as well as his}} tone were full of seriousness.|$|E
50|$|Dith {{travelled}} back to Siem Reap {{where he}} learned that 50 {{members of his family}} had died. The Vietnamese had made him village chief but he feared they would discover <b>his</b> US <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> escaped to Thailand on 3 October 1979.|$|R
50|$|Babak Ejlali is {{the editor}} of Rahsanews.com and a human rights activist. Because of <b>his</b> family <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> {{connections}} with the jailed Iranian blogger Hossein Ronaghi, Babak Ejlali has been interviewed by various media outlets for information about Hossein Ronaghi’s condition.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his high-profile crusade for multiculturalism, Grassby also gained wide attention for his flamboyant dress sense, with <b>his</b> colourful <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> suits setting him apart from the unwritten dress code for politicians of sombre dark suits <b>and</b> plain <b>ties.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{the other}} entered, {{the man in}} the chair gave vent to a {{guttural}} grunt without removing the mouthpiece of his pipe from between his lips; and Major Clutterbuck returned the greeting with an off-handed nod. His next proceeding was to take off his glossy hat and pack it away in a hat-box. He then removed his coat, his collar, <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> his gaiters, with equal solicitude, {{and put them in a}} place of safety. After which he donned a long purple dressing-gown and a smoking-cap, in which garb he performed the first steps of a mazurka as a sign of the additional ease which he experienced.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room and fetched his hat and gloves from a cupboard. He glanced into a looking-glass {{for a moment to}} {{straighten}} <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> met the girl's eyes fixed upon him. He stood quite still, watching. She was looking at him, at his back, as he stood there. There was expression in her face at last, an expression which puzzled him, which he failed altogether to understand. He stood quite still, with his fingers still upon the sailor knot of his tie. As though she realized the possibilities of the mirror, she suddenly turned around. When he came towards her, the mask, if it was a mask, was there once more.|$|E
60|$|Then {{something}} happened to Peter which {{had happened to him}} barely a dozen times in his life. He lost his temper and lost it rather badly. Without an instant's hesitation, he caught up the decanter which stood by his side and flung it in his host's face. Bernadine only partly avoided it by thrusting out his arms. The neck caught his forehead and the blood came streaming over <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> collar. Peter had followed the decanter with a sudden spring. His fingers were upon Bernadine's throat and he thrust his head back. Sogrange sprang to the door to lock it, but he was too late. The room seemed full of men-servants. Peter was dragged away, still struggling fiercely.|$|E
50|$|Wardell {{had been}} found by police in <b>his</b> underpants, <b>tied</b> <b>and</b> gagged {{on the living room}} floor. It didn't make sense that police found Wardell's clothes and shoes had been placed {{carefully}} to one side near where he was found.|$|R
50|$|This {{dramatic}} {{sculpture of}} Jesus Christ awaiting crucifixion, <b>his</b> hands <b>tied</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> body bloodied from the beating he had sustained {{dates to the}} 16th century. The statue is carved from wood and polychromed. This statue is shown on the front cover.|$|R
60|$|The Major {{took off}} his carpet {{slippers}} and pulled on his boots, while Patricia was {{getting ready for the}} walk. Uncle John wandered around the room aimlessly for a time, and then took off <b>his</b> black <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> put on the white one.|$|R
