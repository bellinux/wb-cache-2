40|$|A {{process for}} making a <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> from an {{aluminum}} alloy includes first <b>casting</b> an <b>article</b> from an alloy having the following composition, in weight percent: Silicon (Si) 14. 0 - 25. 0, Copper (CU) 5. 5 - 8. 0, Iron (Fe) 0 - 0. 8, Magnesium (Mg) 0. 5 - 1. 5, Nickel (Ni) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Manganese (Mn) 0 - 1. 0, Titanium (Ti) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zirconium (Zr) 0. 12 - 1. 2, Vanadium (V) 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zinc (Zn) 0 - 0. 9, Phosphorus (P) 0. 001 - 0. 1, Aluminum, balance. In this alloy the ration of Si:Mg is 15 - 35, and the ratio of Cu:Mg is 4 - 15. After an <b>article</b> is <b>cast</b> from the alloy, the <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is aged at a {{temperature within the range}} of 400 F to 500 F for a time period within the range of four to 16 hours. It has been found especially advantageous if the <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is first exposed to a solutionizing step prior to the aging step. This solutionizing step is carried out by exposing the <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> to a temperature within the range of 875 F to 1025 F for a time period of fifteen minutes to four hours. It has also been found to be especially advantageous if the solutionizing step is followed directly with a quenching step, wherein the <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is quenched in a quenching medium such as water at a temperature within the range of 120 F to 300 F. The resulting <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is highly suitable in a number of high temperature applications, such as heavy-duty pistons for internal combustion engines...|$|R

40|$|A <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> from an {{aluminum}} alloy has improved mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> has the following composition in weight percent: Silicon 6. 0 - 25. 0, Copper 5. 0 - 8. 0, Iron 0. 05 - 1. 2, Magnesium 0. 5 - 1. 5, Nickel 0. 05 - 0. 9, Manganese 0. 05 - 1. 2, Titanium 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zirconium 0. 05 - 1. 2, Vanadium 0. 05 - 1. 2, Zinc 0. 05 - 0. 9, Strontium 0. 001 - 0. 1, Phosphorus 0. 001 - 0. 1, {{and the balance}} is Aluminum, wherein the silicon-to-magnesium ratio is 10 - 25, and the copper-to-magnesium ratio is 4 - 15. The aluminum alloy contains a simultaneous dispersion of three types of Al 3 X compound particles (X=Ti, V, Zr) having a LI 2 crystal structure, and their lattice parameters are coherent to the aluminum matrix lattice. A process for producing this <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is also disclosed, {{as well as a}} metal matrix composite, which includes the aluminum alloy serving as a matrix containing up to about 60 % by volume of a secondary filler material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} four store-based concrete memory models. We characterize memory models by {{the class}} of pointers they support and whether they use numerical or symbolic offsets to address values in a block. We give the semantics of a C-like language within each of these memory models to illustrate their differences. The language we consider is a fragment of Leroy's Clight, including arrays, pointer arithmetics but <b>excluding</b> <b>casts.</b> All along the paper, we link these concrete memory models with existing shape analyses...|$|R
5|$|Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, {{which is used to}} <b>cast</b> <b>articles</b> in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.|$|R
40|$|The method {{disclosed}} in this specification {{is one of}} reducing the green density of an <b>article</b> <b>cast</b> in a slip <b>casting</b> operation. The <b>article</b> is <b>cast</b> from a casting slip containing silicon metal particles, yttrium containing particles, and {{a small amount of}} a fluoride salt which is effective to suppress flocculation of the silicon metal particles by y. sup. + 3 ions derived from the yttrium containing particles. The method is characterized by the following step. A small amount of compound which produces a cation which will partly flocculate the particles of silicon metal is added to the casting slip. The small amount of this compound is added so that when the casting slip is slip cast into a casting mold, the partly flocculated particles of silicon will interrupt an otherwise orderly packing of the particles of silicon and particles of yttrium. In this manner, the green density of the slip <b>cast</b> <b>article</b> is reduced and the article may be more easily nitrided...|$|R
5000|$|Spelter, while {{sometimes}} used {{merely as a}} synonym for zinc, {{is often used to}} identify a zinc alloy. In this sense it might be an alloy of equal parts copper and zinc, i.e. a brass, used for hard soldering and brazing, or as an alloy, containing lead, that is used instead of bronze. In this usage it was common for many 19th-century cheap, <b>cast</b> <b>articles</b> such as candlesticks and clock cases and early 20th-century Art Nouveau ornaments and Art Deco figures.|$|R

The history of the factory changed {{depending}} on domestic and European economic situations. At the beginning of its activity, the factory produced devices and equipment for the oil mining, distillery and brewing industries.It later added transportation to its range and by 1894 it had become Poland's most important manufacturer of rail coaches and freight cars, tramcars and other high-capacity vehicles, while continuing to produce their initial output of boilers and other related devices. Later, even more variety of product was added, including cisterns, cranes, dredgers, road rollers, steel lifeboats, steel bridge constructions and <b>casting</b> <b>articles.</b>|$|R

40|$|Modern {{production}} {{methods for}} <b>casting</b> <b>articles</b> {{include the use}} of sand- mould, metal-mould, die, and centrifugal castings. Castings produced using sand mould is known to have peculiar microstructures depending on average size, distribution and shape of the moulding sand grains and the chemical composition of the alloy. These affect the surface finish, permeability and refractoriness of all the castings. In this paper, the effect of using CO 2 process, metal mould, cement-bonded sand mould and naturally-bonded sand mould on the hardness, tensile and impact strengths of as-cast 6063 Aluminum alloy is presented. The results show that there is significant increase in hardness(33. 7 HB) of the alloy when naturally-bonded sand mould is used for its production over that of metal, CO 2 and cement moulds. The stress-strain curves behaviour of the samples also indicated that sample from naturally bonded sand has highest tensile strength with superior ductility. The alloy shows highest impact strength when metal mould is used for sample preparation in comparison with other moulds...|$|R

Use of statistical method of casts in connection with active control of quality and selection of productive stages for serial production of casts from spheroid cast iron caused lower level of defects, and in economic aspect contributed to the reduction of costs of connected production with low level of quality.

40|$|The method {{concerns}} {{forming a}} relatively stable slip of silicon metal particles and yttrium containing particles. In one embodiment, a casting slip of silicon metal particles is formed in water. Particles of a yttrium containing sintering aid {{are added to}} the casting slip. The yttrium containing sintering aid is a compound which has at least some solubility in water to form Y. sup. + 3 ions which have a high potential for totally flocculating the silicon metal particles into a semiporous solid. A small amount of a fluoride salt is added to the casting slip which contains the yttrium containing sintering aid. The fluoride salt is one which will produce fluoride anions when dissolved in water. The small amount of the fluoride anions produced are effective to suppress the flocculation of the silicon metal particles by the Y. sup. + 3 ions so that all particles remain in suspension in the casting slip and the casting slip has both an increased shelf life and can be used to <b>cast</b> <b>articles</b> having a relatively thick cross-section. The pH of the casting slip is maintained in a range from 7. 5 to 9. Preferably, the fluoride salt used is one which is based on a monovalent cation such as sodium or ammonia. The steps of adding the yttrium containing sintering aid and the fluoride salt may be interchanged if desired, and the salt may be added to a solution containing the sintering aid prior to addition of the silicon metal particles...|$|R
