5|$|After being invaded, a queen may {{be forced}} to leave her nest. If a {{satellite}} has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> nest.

5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> manner.|$|E

Upon Marcy's recommendation, Peggy and Al go to the Hop-On-Inn and discover a videotape waiting for them in their room. After watching some of the tape, the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video is Steve and Marcy. Although Al is disgusted, the action turns Peggy on and the couple has sex.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one of the}} plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, {{had suggested}} that the authorities could redevelop the land <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court {{was not in a}} position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better.

5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> manner.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roald Amundsen, a potential rival, had announced plans for an Arctic voyage.|$|E

5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown to result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, {{there is not enough}} evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Each major-thirds tuning repeats its open-notes {{after every}} two strings, {{which results in}} two copies of the three open-strings' notes, each <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> octave.

5|$|For , {{a planned}} {{expansion}} to Halo 3 {{that became a}} full game, O'Donnell and Salvatori abandoned all previous Halo themes and started anew. Due to ODSTs shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell created new music that was evocative of past Halo but branched <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> direction. Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, detective story feel, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the film noir atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|George is a {{supporting}} character {{who appeared in}} various adaptations of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, played by Hugh Laurie.

The character was added to the series as a replacement for the Lord Percy Percy character, who did not appear in the third instalment because Tim McInnerny, the actor playing him, feared being typecast.|$|E
