As the predecessor of Isfahan, the previous Iranian capital of two of the greatest Islamic Empires, the Seljuks and the Safavids, Tehran has a rather short background as a capital and a shorter one as a worldwide well-known megalopolis. On one hand as one of the ten largest cities all around the world, Tehran is faced with all the problems that other metropolises already have. On the other hand it is faced with another fundamental problem: despite many of other cities in its scale or even lower, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>benefiting</b> from no permanent river in its terrain.

In this way, first of all it focuses on the backgrounds of the city, its context, the possibilities and the restrictions.

The growth of this agglomeration of labour, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> argued, <b>benefits</b> both individuals and firms by provid-ing the opportunity for matching labour demand with labour supply, which is crucial to sustaining innovation. Additionally, mobility within the local labour market is argued to <b>be</b> of collective <b>benefit</b> as {{the movement of the}} highly skilled within the cluster is a key mechanism for technology transfer and fostering of interfirm links. Social networks (social capital) are argued in the literature to be the medium by which these activities are facilitated and the development of which is key to innovation-based local economic development. This is exemplified by Silicon Valley. To examine the univer-sality of these assumptions, this article explores the development of social networks among scientists and engineers in the high-technology local economies of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire. Drawing on the results of a postal survey of the engineers, physicists and chemists in the local labour markets of these regions carried out between November 2000 and March 2001, the article considers the networking behaviour of the highly skilled, focusing on the compo-sition and spatial reach of their networks. It concludes that the importance of local networks should not be overstated on the basis that there are distinct differ-ences within two seemingly similar locations and within the professional associations.
