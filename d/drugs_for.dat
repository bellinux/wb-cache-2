As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various psychiatric wards and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, cleaned up and ready to cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain <b>drugs.</b> <b>For</b> example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard's health {{deteriorated}} significantly {{during this}} period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from bursitis and excessive weight, {{and had a}} prominent growth on his forehead. He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and {{had a heart attack}} in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> the next year. In September 1978, Hubbard had a pulmonary embolism, falling into a coma, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial <b>drugs.</b> <b>For</b> severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E

5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{has been}} shown to be {{inhibited}} by the antimetabolite fluorouracil, a drug used in the chemotherapy of cancer. It is one of the most successful <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> treating solid tumors. In yeast cells treated with fluorouracil, defects were found in the processing of ribosomal RNA identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by molecular biological strategies. Lack of correct ribosomal RNA processing is lethal to cells, explaining the antimetabolic effect of the drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a mainstream}} therapy {{that does not}} use pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different <b>drugs.</b> <b>For</b> this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other <b>drugs.</b> <b>For</b> example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital.

5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used {{the results of this study}} to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to leave}} the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug {{addiction}} and asks Dot to obtain <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess {{to the police and}} is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.|$|E
