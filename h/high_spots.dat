Both Van Dam and Benjamin started the match with <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> as Benjamin {{performed}} a Sunset Flip Powerbomb, a move in which a wrestler will roll/flip over an elevated opponent facing them in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent down to the floor. The match {{went back and forth}} with action, but in the end Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash on Benjamin and pinned him to win the match and retain his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Callisto {{is the oldest}} and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is {{completely}} covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of <b>high</b> <b>spots,</b> surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.|$|E

The Kid attempted to perform his finisher, spinning crescent kick, but Hakushi countered it into the Nenbutsu Bomb and pinned him.|$|E

25|$|In early 1949, Simhoni {{was part}} of the {{political}} storm {{that took place in the}} early years of the state. The election rules at the time were much less restrictive.

Mapai was the only party to include four military men in <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> on its ticket. The two highest spots were: Moshe Dayan, in the 10th place followed by Simhoni in 12th place. Both were invited to the Constituent Assembly. Simhoni resigned immediately after the elections and did not attend.|$|E

500|$|Writer Bob Kapur of the Canadian Online Explorer rated Turning Point a 7 out of 10, {{which was}} the same as the rating for the 2005 event.

Styles, Jeff Hardy, and Randy Savage was rated a 3 out of 10, while the Six Sides of Steel cage match main event was rated a 9 out of 10. In his review, Kapur stated that he felt the Six Man Tag Team match was [...] "an overbooked train wreck whose only saving grace was Styles's performance, as he tried to wring out {{something}} decent out of the old-timers". The X Division Championship and main event bouts gained better reviews from Kapur. According to Kapur, the X Division Championship encounter was [...] "a fantastic match which really showcases the talents of both men." [...] Regarding the main event, Kapur described it as [...] "a fantastic match filled with exciting <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> from bell to bell".

2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} {{generally}} {{the combination of}} a cutting edge, such as a sharpened metal plate, attached to a firm body, that when moved over a wood surface, take up relatively uniform shavings, by nature of the body riding on the 'high spots' in the wood, and also by providing a relatively constant angle to the cutting edge, render the planed surface very smooth. A cutter which extends below the bottom surface, or sole, of the plane slices off shavings of wood. A large, flat sole on a plane guides the cutter to remove only the highest parts of an imperfect surface, until, after several passes, the surface is flat and smooth. When used for flattening, bench planes with longer soles are preferred for boards with longer longitudinal dimensions. A longer sole registers against a greater portion of the board's face or edge surface which leads to a more consistently flat surface or straighter edge. Conversely, using a smaller plane allows for more localized low or <b>high</b> <b>spots</b> to remain.|$|E

The latter had tracks by fellow Sydney hard rockers, Hard-Ons, to coincide with a joint Australian tour the two bands undertook mid-year. The Celibate Rifles' tracks were [...] "5 Lamps" [...] and [...] "Electric Flowers". The group then embarked on the Live Stick '92 world tour across the UK, Europe and the US.

The song's first televised performance was during the 2014 American Music Awards, where both closed out the show, with Lopez also previewing a new song entitled [...] "Throw Your Hair Back." [...] The performance started out with Lopez in a black and white leotard [...] "that showed off her famous assets", as cited by Allison Takeda from Us Magazine. Takeda continued the description, adding that [...] "later, she was joined onstage by Azalea, who rocked a glittery metallic leotard. As they danced, patterened lights flashed across the stage, covering them in polka dots, stripes, and diamonds. During the performance, Lopez stopped singing to check out a ringing cell phone, which she dismissed with the offhand observation, [...] "Just a booty call." [...] Daniel D'Addario of Time named that the performance [...] "was the most dynamic of the night," [...] while Joe Lynch of Billboard called it [...] "a perfect showstopper." [...] Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Music pointed out that it [...] "demonstrated why she deserved the headlining spot of what was otherwise a rather uneventful telecast." [...] Carey Ganz of Rolling Stone selected it as one of the best, praising Lopez for showing that it was her performance, although Azalea was also featured. Ganz noted that [...] "she got to hit all the contortionist <b>high</b> <b>spots,</b> and was the beneficiary of the best production moments. When she and Azalea did share the stage, it was still clear who was in charge. Then, just to further cement her status, Lopez closed the show solo, strutting and shaking her way across the stage before backing it up to Pitbull to send the show home." [...] Lopez has {{performed the}} track regularly since its release as a part of her live shows set list, including on her Mawazine headlining show on May 29, 2015, and on her Las Vegas residency show [...]|$|E
