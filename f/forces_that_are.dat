He called for {{the realization that the}} United States is in a more-or-less permanent state of war with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks. Finally, he alluded to the long-term nature of the conflict and blamed the attacks on the lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America's enemies over the past several decades.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies with}} Manduca sexta, moths have dynamic flight sensory {{abilities}} {{due to their}} antennae. The antennae are vibrated in a plane {{so that when the}} body of the moth rotates during controlled aerial maneuvers, the antennae are subject to the inertial coriolis <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> linearly proportional to the angular velocity of the body. The coriolis forces cause deflections of the antennae, which are detected by the Johnston's organ at the base of each antenna, with strong frequency responses at the beat frequency of the antennae (around 25Hz) and at twice the beat frequency. The relative magnitude of the two frequency responses enables the moth to distinguish rotation around the different principal axes, allowing for rapid course control during aerial maneuvers.|$|E

500|$|Ro makes {{a series}} of {{appearances}} in the non-canonical novel series based on The Next Generation. Her first appearance is in the novel, War Drums, by John Vorholt, published in 1998, which chronicles a mission to a planet called Selva, and Ro plays a major role. Also included is an expansion on her background and early life in the book Night of the Wolves by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison. The events of the away mission while she was serving on the USS Wellington were shown in the second special issue of DC Comics' [...] series. Ro's career with the Maquis is also chronicled in the novels. In Rogue Saucer, she is responsible for planning out {{the attack on the}} Enterprise in which the Maquis steal a prototype saucer section. Ro appears in the novel Tunnel Through the Stars, set during the events of the Dominion War.

[...] Within two years, Józef Ulam {{and the rest of}} his family were victims of the Holocaust, Hugo Steinhaus was in hiding, Kazimierz Kuratowski was lecturing at the underground university in Warsaw, [...] Włodzimierz Stożek and his two sons had been killed in the massacre of Lwów professors, and the last problem had been recorded in the Scottish Book. Stefan Banach survived the Nazi occupation by feeding lice at Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute. In 1963, Adam Ulam, who had become an eminent kremlinologist at Harvard, received a letter from George Volsky, who hid in Józef Ulam's house after deserting from the Polish army. [...] This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lwów's chaotic scenes in late 1939. In later life Ulam described himself as [...] "an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate".|$|E

500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E
500|$|Faulkner is {{considered}} one of the foremost American writers on race in the United States, and his novels, including Light in August, often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the South that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 21st century. Christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets, and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised call him [...] "nigger." [...] Chapter 6 begins with the oft-cited sentence: Memory believes before knowing remembers and gives an account of the five year old Christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children. The first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor. However suspicion must fall on Doc Hines Joe's derranged grandfather who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman. It is he who may have whispered the lie about the liitle boy's origines to the other children. Because of this, Joe Christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some African American blood, which Faulkner never confirms, and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth. Because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities, black and white, Christmas lives his life always on the road. The secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes; he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white Northern woman reacts nonchalantly. Though Christmas is guilty of violent crimes, Faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from Southern history.|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E
