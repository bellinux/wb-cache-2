500|$|Some of the songs, {{including}} [...] "I Fall in Love Too Easily", [...] "Masqualero", and [...] "The Theme", {{were from}} Davis' 1950s and 1960s repertoire. [...] "The Theme" [...] was originally recorded in 1955 {{by his first}} great quintet and was used to close most of his concerts from the late 1950s to 1970, after which he began to favor [...] "Sanctuary" [...] as a closing number. [...] "Masqualero" [...] was performed in a similar rock-influenced fashion as the newer material, with DeJohnette and Holland carrying aggressive vamps and Corea playing distorted riffs on his electric piano. John Szwed believed the music paid homage to Davis' past, [...] "respecting space, solos, form, and fixed rhythms, though there are also hints throughout that [...] will soon <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> way to organize this music to play it live." [...] In Corea's opinion, the record was an accurate document of how this particular band of Davis' played in concert.|$|E

"Bedtime Story" [...] has {{frequently}} {{been cited as}} one of the songs with the most unfulfilled potential in Madonna's career, nonetheless, the song did enjoy some success, being a club [...] "favorite" [...] in the mid-1990s. It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially Ray of Light (1998), which according to Vicente, owes [...] "its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'". O'Brien wrote in Madonna: Like an Icon, that the song [...] "foreshadowed [...] move towards electronica" [...] and labelled it an [...] "embryonic moment that went a lot further on the next few albums". De Vries recalled that tackling the song [...] "seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at the leash a little bit, to <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums." [...] In a review for the Bedtime Stories album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song was [...] "the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais".|$|E
500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E
