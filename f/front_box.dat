This version includes the original retail version of the game, along with the Spec 2.0 update already installed, plus vouchers for the game's DLC that was released in 2011. This version also has an alternative box art: Instead of the Le Mans Red Mercedes SLS AMG, the same car is now painted silver, and the inside cover features two screenshots of the Red Bull X2011 Race Car (which is featured as DLC, itself being an evolved, faster form of the Red Bull X2010 featured in the game as well), which can be flipped and used as the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> cover.|$|E
60|$|So away {{went the}} pleased party to Covent Garden {{to see the}} tragedy of the immortal John Home. The ladies and the General were {{conveyed}} in a glass coach, and found the young men in waiting to receive them at the theatre door. Hence they elbowed their way through a crowd of torch-boys, and a whole regiment of footmen. Little Hetty fell to Harry's arm in this expedition, and the blushing Miss Theo was handed to the box by Mr. George. Gumbo had kept the places until his masters arrived, when he retired, with many bows, to take his own seat in the footman's gallery. They had good places in a <b>front</b> <b>box,</b> and there was luckily a pillar behind which mamma could weep in comfort. And opposite them they had the honour to see the august hope of the empire, his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, with the Princess Dowager his mother, whom the people greeted with loyal, but not very enthusiastic, plaudits. That handsome man standing behind his Royal Highness was my Lord Bute, the Prince's Groom of the Stole, the patron of the poet whose performance they had come to see, and over whose work the Royal party had already wept more than once.|$|E
6000|$|Let this {{mechanic}} {{form and}} vulgar legibility notify {{you a little}} at the start that I am in rather a hampered and hindered state, and that that must plead both for my delay in acknowledging your dear faithful letter of the New Year time, and for my at last having {{to make the best}} of this too impersonal art.... I won't go into the history of my woes--all the more that I really hope I have shuffled the worst of them off. Even in this most recent form they have been part and parcel of the grave illness that overtook me as long ago as at the New Year, 1910, and with a very imperfect recovery from which I was struggling during those weary American months of winter-before-last when we planned so in vain that I should come to you in Washington. I have deeply regretted, ever since, my failure of that pleasure--all the more that I don't see it now as conceivably again within my reach. I am restored to this soil, for whatever may remain to me of my mortal career. The grand swing across the globe, which you and Harry will again nobly accomplish--again and yet again--now simply mocks at my weakness and my reduced resources. Besides, I am but too thankful to have a refuge in which continuously to crouch. Please fix well in your mind that continuity--as making it easy for you some day to find me here. The continuity is broken simply by my reverting to the country for the summer and autumn--a mere change from the blue bed to the brown, and then from the brown back again to this Thames-side perch, which I call the blue. I hang here, for six months, straight over the River and find it delightful and interesting, at once ever so quiet and ever so animated. The River has a quantity of picturesque and dramatic life and motion that one had never appreciated till one had thrown oneself on it de confiance. But it's another London, this old Chelsea of simplifications and sacrifices, from the world in which I so like to feel that I for so long lived more or less with you. I feel somehow as much away from that now as you and Harry must feel amid your new Washington horizons--and it has of itself, for that matter, gone to pieces under the sweep of the big broom of Time, which has scattered it without ceremony. A few vague and altered relics of it occasionally dangle for a moment before me. I was going to say [...] "cross my path"--but I haven't now such a thing as a path, or it goes such a very few steps. I try meanwhile to project myself in imagination into your Washington existence--and, besides your own allusions to it, a passing visit a few days since from Walter Berry helped me a little to fix the shining vision. W. B. had been, I gathered, but a day or two near you, and wasn't in possession of many particulars. Beyond this, too, though you shine to me you shine a bit fearfully--for I can't rid myself (in a world of Chelsea limits and fashions) of a sense of the formidable, the somehow--at least for the likes of me!--difficult and bristling and glaring, side of the American conditions. However, you of course lightly ride the whirlwind--or at any rate have only as much or as little of the storms as you will, and can pick out of it only such musical thunder-rolls and most purely playful forked lightnings as suit you best. What I mean is that here, after a fashion, a certain part of the work of discrimination and selection and primary clearing of the ground is already done for one, in a manner that enables one to begin, for one's self, further on or higher up; whereas over there I seemed to see myself, speaking only from my own experience, often beginning so [...] "low down," [...] just in that way of sifting and selecting, that all one's time went to it and one was spent before arriving at any very charming altitude. This you will find obscure, but study it well--though strictly in private, so as not to give me away as a sniffy critic. Heaven knows I indulge in the most remorseless habits of criticism here--even if I make no great public use of them, through the increasing privacy and antiquity of my life. I kind of wonder about the bearing of the queer Democratic régime that seems as yet so obscurely to loom upon any latent possibilities (that might have been) on Harry's and your [...] "career"--just as I wonder what unutterable queerness may not, as a feature of the whole conundrum, [...] "representatively" [...] speaking, before long cause us all here to sit up and stare: one or two such startling rumours about the matter, I trust groundless, having already had something of that effect. But we must all wait, mustn't we? and I do indeed envy you both your so interesting opportunity for doing so, in a <b>front</b> <b>box</b> at the comedy, or tragedy, the fine old American show, that is, whatever turn it takes: it will all give you, these next months, so much to look at and talk about and expertly appreciate. Lord, how I wish I were in a state or situation to be dining with you to-night! I am dying, really, to see your House--which means alas that I shall die without doing so. No glimmer of a view of the new Presidential family as a White House group has come my way--so that I sit in darkness there as all around, and feel you can but say that it serves me right not to have managed my life better--especially with your grand example! Amen, amen!...|$|E

A large ancient stone altar was discovered in the south wall during the 1978 renovations; this is now used as the altar in Saint John the Baptist Church, Penistone.|$|E
50|$|Within {{a decade}} of being {{introduced}} in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box camera, the Robert’s-type camera or “Boston box”, and the Lewis-type camera. The American-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear, and {{an opening in the}} rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. The top of the camera had hinged doors for placing photographic plates. Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for close-ups. The lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. The Robert’s-type cameras were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear {{on the front of the}} camera, which moved the back box for focusing. Many Robert’s-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. The main body of the Lewis-type camera was mounted on the <b>front</b> <b>box,</b> but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once focused, a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second, in-camera copy of the original image.|$|E
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) is used {{to study}} the flow around a simplified tractor-trailer model. The model consists of two boxes placed in tandem. The <b>front</b> <b>box</b> represents the cab of a tractor-trailer road vehicle and the rear box represents the trailer. The LES was made at the Reynolds number of 0. 51 × 106 based on {{the height of the}} rear box and the inlet air velocity. Two variants of the model were studied, one where the leading edges on the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> are sharp and one where the edges are rounded. One small and one large gap width between the two boxes were studied for both variants. Two computational grids were used in the LES simulations and a comparison was made with available experimental force measurements. The results of the LES simulations were used to analyze the flow field around the cab and in the gap between the two boxes of the tractor-trailer model. Large vortical structures around the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> and in the gap were identified. The flow field analysis showed how these large vortical structures are responsible for the difference in the drag force for the model that arises when the leading edges on the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> are rounded and the gap width is varied...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study using}} large eddy simulation (LES) {{of the flow}} around a simplified tractor-trailer model has been done. The model is that from the experimental investigation [1] and consists of two boxes placed in tandem arrangement. The Reynolds number based on {{the height of the}} rear box and free stream velocity is 0. 51 x 106. The first box has normalized height, width and depth of 0. 92, 0. 92 and 0. 67, respectively, and represents the cab of a truck. The second box has height, width and depth of 1, 1, and 2. 5, respectively, and represents the load of a truck. The <b>front</b> <b>box</b> is lifted 0. 21 above the simulated moving ground and the rear box is lifted 0. 5. The aim of the present study has been to investigate the influence {{of the size of the}} gap between the tractor and the trailer on the flow physics and the resulting aerodynamic performance of the tractor-trailer model. Two different models have been investigated. One model with sharp front edges of the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> and one with rounded front edges of the <b>front</b> <b>box.</b> Experimental results [1] have shown that the two cases exhibit large differences in the drag coefficient depending on the gap width between the boxes. For smaller gap widths, the model with rounded front edges has a considerably smaller drag, while for larger but still practical gap widths the drag exceeds that of the sharp-edged model significantly. Simulations with three different gap widths for each model has been simulated using LES. The results has shown good agreement with the available experimental data from [1] for the sharp model but less accurate results for the rounded model even though the general trend is in agreement. The mean velocity field has been analysed and the flow physics responsible for the difference in drag for the models has been found...|$|E
40|$|In many {{languages}} {{the future}} is in front and the past behind, but in some cultures (like Aymara) the past is in front. Is it possible to find this mapping as an alternative conceptualization of time in other cultures? If so, what are the factors that affect its choice out of the set of available alternatives? In a paper and pencil task, participants placed future or past events either in front or behind a character (a schematic head viewed from above). A sample of 24 Islamic participants (whose language also places the future in front and the past behind) tended to locate the past event in the <b>front</b> <b>box</b> more often than Spanish participants. This result {{might be due to}} the greater cultural value assigned to tradition in Islamic culture. The same pattern was found in a sample of Spanish elders (N = 58), what may support that conclusion. Alternatively, the crucial factor may be the amount of attention paid to the past. In a final study, young Spanish adults (N = 200) who had just answered a set of questions about their past showed the past-in-front pattern, whereas questions about their future exacerbated the future-in-front pattern. Thus, the attentional explanation was supported: attended events are mapped to front space in agreement with the experiential connection between attending and seeing. When attention is paid to the past, it tends to occupy the front location in spite of available alternative mappings in the language-culture...|$|E
