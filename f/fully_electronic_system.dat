His 600-line colour system used triple interlacing, using six scans to build each picture. Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colours generated by the three guns. One of them, the Geer tube, was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Absolute Block System (ABS) of railway {{signalling}} {{was developed}} in Britain during the 19 th century and refined {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century [1, 2].

In normal working this arrangement eliminates the potential for head-on collisions. However, additional constraints are required in order to prevent other kinds of accidents, e. g. one train running into the rear of another which has broken down. ABS is a signalling system which aims to prevent such accidents. In the following sections we des...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1908, the {{scientific}} journal Nature published {{a letter in}} which Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), discussed how a <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> television <b>system</b> could be realized by using cathode ray tubes (or [...] "Braun" [...] tubes, after its inventor, Karl Braun) as both imaging and display devices. He noted that the [...] "real difficulties lie in devising an efficient transmitter", {{and that it was}} possible that [...] "no photoelectric phenomenon at present known will provide what is required". A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. Campbell-Swinton later expanded on his vision in a presidential address given to the Röntgen Society in November 1911. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes. His concept for a <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> television <b>system</b> was later popularized by Hugo Gernsback as the [...] "Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System" [...] in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine Electrical Experimenter.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate {{the risks associated with}} converting a paper-based pediatric chemotherapy ordering process to a <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>system.</b> Methods: Formal process redesign and systems analysis, primarily through Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), was used to evaluate the current, paper-based chemotherapy medications process. A commercial software system designed to accomplish computerized provider order entry (CPOE), safety checks, pharmacy dispensing, and medication administration documentation were examined to determine whether these integrated applications are as safe as a paper process with multiple redundant checks. Results: Formal process redesign and system analysis methods uncovered important potential failure points within the integration points of the electronic system. Conclusion: Prospective, institution-specific process redesign and system analysis is a valuable tool for determining the safety and feasibility of converting complex medication ordering processes from paper to electronic systems. Commercially available CPOE systems may not be immediately capable of safely executing complex chemotherapy regimens...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of medication errors {{is an essential}} prerequisite for better healthcare delivery. The present study investigated prescribing errors in prescriptions from outpatient departments (OPDs) and emergency wards of two public sector hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A manual prescription system was followed in Hospital A. Hospital B was running a semi-computerised prescription system in the OPD and a fully computerised prescription system in the emergency ward. A total of 510 prescriptions from both departments of these two hospitals were evaluated for patient characteristics, demographics and medication errors. The data was analysed using a chi square test for comparison of errors between both the hospitals. The medical departments in OPDs of both hospitals were the highest prescribers at 45 %- 60 %. The age group receiving the most treatment in emergency wards of both the hospitals was 21 - 30 years (21 %- 24 %). A trend of omitting patient addresses and diagnoses was observed in almost all prescriptions from both of the hospitals. Nevertheless, patient information such as name, age, gender and legibility of the prescriber's signature were found in almost 100 % of the electronic-prescriptions. In addition, no prescribing error was found pertaining to drug concentrations, quantity and rate of administration in e-prescriptions. The total prescribing errors in the OPD and emergency ward of Hospital A {{were found to be}} 44 % and 60 %, respectively. In hospital B, the OPD had 39 % medication errors and the emergency department had 73. 5 % errors; this unexpected difference between the emergency ward and OPD of hospital B was mainly due to the inclusion of 69. 4 % omissions of route of administration in the prescriptions.
