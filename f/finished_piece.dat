25|$|The {{speech that}} Jupiter uses {{to start the}} meeting is a <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> of oratory. It opens with an exordium (1st strophe), in which, after an {{original}} welcome, Jupiter briefly defines the subject. This is followed, in the ancient rhetorical fashion, by the narration (the past shows that {{the intention of the}} Fados is the same one that the orator presented). There is then a confirmation of suggestions already put forth in the narration of the 4th strophe. This episode then ends with two strophes of peroration, where Jupiter appeals to the benevolence of the gods concerning the sons of Lusus, with Jupiter's speech eventually settling the debate.|$|E

The campaign follows {{the adventures of}} Brokk and Eitri, the dwarves who appeared in the initial campaign. The plot unfolds with both dwarves planning to create a giant golden boar as an offering to the Norse god Freyr. While working separately, Brokk is approached by Skult (also from Fall of the Trident) who warns him that Eitri is making preparations to create the boar without his brother, of which Eitri is also told the same about Brokk. As both brothers race to complete the boar in the great forge, Skult steals the <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> and holds it in Loki's fortress. The brothers eventually assault the base, and the boar is retrieved and successfully offered to Freyr.|$|E

500|$|After the {{remixing}} of {{the songs}} started, Benitez noted, [...] "We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums be? How much should the vocals stand out?' These are creative decisions which will change the <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> of music." [...] Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that [...] "normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime." [...] The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report was {{the first}} film to have an entirely digital {{production}} design. Termed [...] "previz", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film's narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3-D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previs system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said [...] "t became pretty clear that [...] wouldn't read an illustration as a <b>finished</b> <b>piece,</b> but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it." [...] Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferenced publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam {{on the set of}} [...] "A Beautiful Mind" [...] in New York.|$|E

2500|$|As {{noted by}} the editor Perpessicius, during the interwar a [...] "most absurd" [...] urban legend had spread, {{according}} to which Eminescu had written the poem on the night train taking him to Bucharest. In fact, several drafts of the poem exists, some {{as long as the}} <b>finished</b> <b>piece.</b> Perpessicius rates these as [...] "standalone types" [...] and, in 1938, opted to publish them as separate pieces in his companion to Eminescu's work, with philologist Petru Creția calling them the [...] "Luceafărul constellation". Its earliest recognizable component is Fata-n grădina de aur ("Girl in the Garden of Gold"), written ca. 1873, when Eminescu was in Berlin. It was the ottava rima version of Romanian folklore prose-piece—retrieved by the Silesian Richard Kunisch and published in 1861 Das Mädchen im goldenen Garten. The source was cryptically identified as [...] "the German K." [...] in Eminescu's notebooks, and the bibliographic information was pieced together by Moses Gaster.|$|E
2500|$|The {{illusion}} of a courtyard setting is further enhanced by the beautiful plaster cast statues that are strategically placed throughout the Palace.

With his brother, Emilio, the Caproni firm supplied plaster cast sculptures [...] to schools, museums and theatres throughout America, including Symphony Hall, Boston. Eberson used them in all of his atmospheric theatres. Caproni believed that [...] "the quality of a reproduction is of the greatest importance. In an original work of merit there is a subtleness of treatment—a certain feeling which, if captured in reproduction, places the <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> within the realm of art itself." [...] The statues installed at the Palace are castings of classical Greek and Roman works, including the Praying Boy, the Capitoline Antinous, Doryphoros and Diana of Versailles. A casting of Lorado Taft's George Washington, dressed in Revolutionary War clothing is located in a balcony niche.|$|E

2500|$|Gaga {{released}} her debut studio album, The Fame, in 2008. Consisting of Electropop and synthpop songs, {{the songs on}} the album offered a commentary {{on the structure of}} fame, the opposition between celebrity and fan base, as well as the life of a wealthy person. After the worldwide success of The Fame, the idea of a re-release arose. However, Gaga felt that re-releases were a disservice to music artists because [...] "it's artists sneaking singles onto an already <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> of work {{in an effort to keep}} the album afloat." [...] Her label, Interscope Records, initially wanted three songs for the project, titled as The Fame Monster. But as the tracks began taking definite form, it developed into [...] "much more than that". Gaga had already composed a song, [...] "Monster", by March 2009. She sought for a darker and edgier concept than she had previously done, and cited her love of horror films and [...] "the decay of the celebrity and the way that fame is a monster in society" [...] as creative inspirations for The Fame Monster.

[...] So each of the wise people took a <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> of work and came to Moses to present him the boards, the bars, and all the parts. As soon as Moses saw the parts, the Holy Spirit settled on him, and he set the Tabernacle up. The Midrash {{clarified}} that Moses did not set it up by himself, for miracles were performed with it, and it rose of its own accord, for [...] says (using the passive voice), [...] "The Tabernacle was reared up." [...] And the Midrash taught that Solomon's Temple, too, was built of its own accord. Similarly, noting that [...] reports that [...] "the Tabernacle was reared up" [...] – using the passive voice – another Midrash told that when in [...] God told Moses to set up the Tabernacle, Moses protested {{that he did not know}} how to set it up. So God told Moses to begin working with his hands and make a show of setting it up, and the Tabernacle would stand up on its own. But God reassured Moses that God would record that Moses set it up, as [...] reports, [...] "Moses reared up the Tabernacle." ...|$|E

At first the silence of the night was utter. Then a high wind began in the distance among the tree-tops, and for hours continued to grow higher. It seemed to me much such a wind as we had found on our visit; yet here in our open chamber we were fanned only by gentle and refreshing draughts, so deep was the canyon, so close our house was planted under the overhanging rock.|$|E
60|$|The last {{of these}} works is the Orator. We have passed in review the De Oratore, and the Brutus; or, De Claris Oratoribus. We have now to {{consider}} that which is commonly {{believed to be the}} most <b>finished</b> <b>piece</b> of the three. Such seems to have become the general idea of those scholars who have spoken and written on the subject. He himself says that there are in all five books. There are the three De Oratore; the fourth is called the Brutus, and the fifth the Orator.[265] In some MSS. this work has a second title, De Optimo Genere Dicendi--as though the five books should run on in a sequence, the first three being on oratory in general, the fourth as to famous orators, while the last concluding work is on the best mode of oratory. Readers who may wish to carry these in their minds must exclude for the moment from their memory the few pages which he wrote as a preface to the translations from Æschines and Demosthenes. The purport is to show how that hitherto unknown hero of romance may be produced--the perfect orator.|$|E

Miss Miranda is tall and rather flat; she is too pale; she hasn't the adorable rougeurs of the little Anglaise.
