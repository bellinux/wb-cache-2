5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more than <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the T1000 stock have earlier been used on the Oslo metro. This includes 146 cars of the types T1 through T4, that have third-rail only operation, and thus did not run on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås lines. These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five)</b> cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and overhead wire equipment, normally ran on the Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (three cars).|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|Art {{projects}} {{continue in}} various ways.

60|$|There {{were then}} many poets of no mean merit, all capable of admirable verse on occasion; and in various degrees possessed of the lofty, vigorous, and vivid style of that great age. The theatre, and {{writing for the}} theatre, afforded to many men of talent a means of {{livelihood}} analogous to that offered by journalism among ourselves. They were apt to work collectively, several hands hurrying out a single play; and in twos <b>or</b> threes, <b>or</b> <b>fours</b> <b>or</b> <b>fives,</b> they often collaborated.|$|R

Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets of <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed {{amount of time to}} attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E
50|$|In the show, {{people first}} {{audition}} {{but eventually the}} performers are narrowed down to 10 finalists, with each contestant performing live. There are <b>four</b> judges (<b>or</b> <b>five)</b> who provide critiques of each competitor's performance.|$|R

5|$|Enomoto's fleet joined Sendai harbour on August 26. Although the Northern Coalition was numerous, it was poorly equipped, and {{relied on}} {{traditional}} fighting methods. Modern armament was scarce, and last-minute {{efforts were made}} to build cannons made of wood and reinforced with roping, firing stone projectiles. Such cannons, installed on defensive structures, could only fire <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> projectiles before bursting. On the other hand, the daimyō of Nagaoka managed to procure two of the three Gatling guns in Japan and 2,000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer Henry Schnell.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
