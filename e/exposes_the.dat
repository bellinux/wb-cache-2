40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in MGC 803 cell lines subjected by various time-phase hypoxic dispositions, and further {{to discuss the}} influence of mtDNA transcripts on hypoxic resistance to irradiation. METHODS The MGC 803 cells exposed to anoxic environment were divided into control group (0 h), hypoxic group (2 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h) and irradiated group after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. RT-PCR was applied to detect the transcripts of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND 4), ND 5, cytochrome b (cyt-b) and ATPase 6 (ATP- 6) in MGC 803 cell lines at various time-phases of hypoxic, and after X-ray irradiation. Flow cytometry and colony formation assay were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle phase and survival fraction. RESULTS COI and ND 4 transcripts of MGC 803 cell lines were influenced remarkably by hypoxia. COI transcripts were decreased remarkably with the elongation time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic, and reduced to one fourth of its original amount of pre-hypoxia 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. ND 4 transcripts were increased initially, and elevated to two folds 8 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia, and then reduced to one second 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in G 1 phase blockage, especially after hypoxia for 16 h. The survival fraction of MGC 803 cells <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia in irradiated group showed that as <b>the</b> time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic before irradiation is prolonged, the survival fraction of MGC 803 cells may have an elevated tendency. CONCLUSION The tumor cells with lower expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic have stronger resistance to the radiation, which indicates that increasing the expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 might be advantageous to enhance the sensitivity of hypoxic tumor cells to the radiotherapy...|$|R

5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} flat frequency response. The sound of the NS-10 is slightly heavy in the midrange, and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the midrange at around 2kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The midrange response is so open that it <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E

50|$|The diving {{equipment}} used for offshore work is chosen {{to facilitate the}} {{work to be done}} while <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> personnel involved to an acceptably low level of risk.

5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and <b>exposes</b> <b>the</b> endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
