40|$|Operation of {{pressurised}} water reactors involves shutdown periods for refuelling and maintenance. In {{preparation for}} this, the reactor system is cooled down, depressurised and partially drained. Although reactor coolant pressure {{is lower than}} during full-power operation, there remains {{the possibility of a}} Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA), with a certain but low probability. While the decay heat to be removed is lower than that from a LOCA at full power, the reduced availability of safety systems implies a risk of failing to maintain core cooling, and hence of core damage. This is recognised though probabilistic safety analyses (PSA), which identify low but non-negligible contributions to core damage frequency from accidents during cooldown and shutdown. Analyses are made for a typical two-loop Westinghouse PWR of the consequences of a range of LOCAs during <b>hot</b> and intermediate <b>shutdown,</b> 4 and 5 hours after reactor shutdown respectively. The accumulators are isolated, while power to some of the pumped safety injection systems (SIs) is racked out.

40|$|Optimal {{feedforward}} {{and robust}} feedback control provides structural durability and desired performance of fossil power plants. Simulation {{results are presented}} to demonstrate life extension of a typical power plant while satisfying the performance specifications. Key Words-Power-station control: feedforward control: robust control. Abatraet-The objective of life-extending control is to achieve a trade-off between structural durabiilty and dynamic performance. This paper focuses on structural durability of the main steam header under load following to illustrate how the life-extending control of fossil fuel power plants can be achieved via feedforward/feedback. This concept is poten-tially applicable to both new and aging power plants {{under a variety of}} operational modes such as <b>hot</b> start-up, scheduled <b>shutdown,</b> and load following where the plant power is rapidly maneuvered to meet the varying load demand. The feedforward control policy is synthesized via nonlinear optimization of a multi-objective cost functional of dynamic performance and service life under the constraints of actuator saturation, operational limitations, and allowable structural damage, including thermomechanical fatigue and plastic deformation. A linear robust feedback control law that is superimposed on the feedforward sequence is synthesized based on induced &-norm techniques. The results of simulation experiments are presented to demonstr-ate that the proposed feedforward/feedback control policy is potentially capable of ramping the plant power up at a rate of 10 % of the full load per minute while maintaining the specified performance and satisfying the damage constraints...|$|R

SUMMARY: Notice is hereby {{given that}} {{the staff of the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has {{prepared}} a model safety evaluation (SE) and model license amendment request (LAR) relating to changes to the end-state requirements for required actions in B&W reactor plants’ technical specifications (TS). Current technical specification action requirements frequently require that the unit be brought to cold shutdown when the technical specification limiting condition for operation for a system has not been met. Depending on the system, and the affected safety function, the requirement to go to cold shutdown may not represent the most risk effective course of action. In accordance with a qualitative risk analysis that provides a basis for changes to the action requirement to shutdown, where appropriate the shutdown endstate is changed from cold shutdown to <b>hot</b> <b>shutdown.</b> The affected TS are...|$|E

40|$|To obtain Commission {{approval}} {{to publish the}} proposed rule, including {{the issue of the}} need for an interim enforcement discretion policy and make available the draft regulatory guide and other supporting documents for public comment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{feasibility}} of a high content thorium fuelled pressurized water reactor. The {{focus is on the}} neutronic behaviors. Thorium based fuel design options with four different fissile components are investigated. Standard uranium oxide is used as the reference fuel. The analysis is performed using the statistical codes MCNP and MCB. First, the fuel compositions are adjusted to obtain the required discharge burnup 55 MWd/kgH. M. under a fixed power density. Next, neutron spectrum, power profile, reactivity coefficients as well as kinetic coefficients are studied. The calculation shows a significant reduction of {{the quantity and quality of}} plutonium can be achieved if 233 U or MEU is used as the fissile component. Plutonium is the main source of proliferation potential and radiotoxicity generated during the irradiation of the standard UOX fuel. At the same time, although the coolant temperature coefficient for thorium with 233 U as fissile component is slightly positive, negative feedbacks from fuel and coolant are large enough for the safety issues during normal operation. If 233 U and LWR spent fuel grade plutonium is mixed properly and used as the fissile component, the breeding ratio can be about 1. The neutron spectrum created in this case is more thermal than that in case of thorium fuel with plutonium as fissile material. All the coefficients are in reasonable range. Especially, the coolant temperature coefficient is negative. Last, a simple shutdown study was carried out. The shutdown margin is enough in both <b>hot</b> <b>shutdown</b> events and cold shutdown events...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} developed {{provides guidance}} {{on the use}} of Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for the risk-informed evaluation of Guides which ensure the compliment of Outage Key Safety Functions (OKSFs) in Nuclear Power Plants. The methodology has been applied to the 3 rd and 13 th Plant Operational States (POSs) as a Pilot experience. These POSs are within the operating mode 4 (<b>Hot</b> <b>Shutdown)</b> of a 3 loops Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactor. The addressed Guide requires the operability of just one charge pump as boric acid supply source. PSA gives a Core Damage Frequency increase (¿CDF) of 1. 19 • 10 - 6 year- 1 for the unavailability of the charge pump in standby, consequently, the maximum exposure time (time for the increase of Core Damage Probability of the configuration to reach 1. 0 E- 06) for this situation is T= 53. 6 hours. Given an average time for the POSs of 40 hours, it is concluded that the charge pumps requirement is correct. However, it could be improved with the inclusion of an additional inventory replacement function. This would limit the effect on Risk of the charge pump unavailability. Furthermore, the need for the external electrical sources to be available during mode 4 is ratified. The procedure requires the operability of both supply sources during the POSs. The unavailability of one of supply sources them involves a ¿CDF equal to 1. 64 • 10 - 5 year- 1 and a maximum exposure time of T= 3. 89 hours. This requirement is considered appropriate from the risk-informed regulation point of view. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The areas {{reviewed}} {{in this section}} of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) include those instrumentation and control systems-associated with systems used to achieve and maintain a safe shutdown condition of the plant. To the extent that the engineered safety feature (ESF) systems are used to achieve and maintain safe shutdown, the review of these systems in this section is limited to those features which are unique to safe shutdown and not directly related to accident mitigation. Such features may involve individual component control for safe shutdown versus sytem level actuation for accident mitigation or system operating modes which involve considerations which differ for safe shutdown and accident mitigation. This SRP section also addresses the review of those systems required for safe shutdown which are not classified as ESF systems. The specific arrangement of these systems depends on the type of plant (pressurized water reactor, PWR; boiling water reactor, BWR; etc.) as well as on individual plant design features, and the conditions under. which the safe shutdown has to be achieved and maintained. The functional performance requirements of safe shut-down systems and essential auxiliary supporting systems are reviewed by other branches in accordance with the SRP sections which address these systems. There are two kinds of shutdown conditions: <b>hot</b> <b>shutdown</b> and cold shutdown. In either case, it is necessary that reactivity control systems maintain a sub-critical condition of the core and that residual heat removal systems operate to maintain adequate cooling of the core. For a precise definition of both shutdown conditions for a specific plant, see Chapter 16, "Technical Specifications, " in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR). Section 7. 5 includes the information systems important to safety that provide information which is used for the manual control of systems required for safe shutdown...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{informs the}} Commission of the staff's intent to re-issue for public comment a {{proposed}} rulemaking package addressing shutdown and fuel storage pool operations at nuclear power plants. BACKGROUND: In SECY- 94 - 176, the staff sought Commission approval to issue for public comment a proposed rule for shutdown and low-power operation at nuclear power plants. The Commission approved the request in the staff requirements memorandum dated September 12, 1994, {{and the proposed}} rule {{was published in the}} Federal Register in October 1994. The numerous comments received were considered along with Commission guidance regarding the use of a risk-informed, performance-based approach for new regulations. As a result, the staff made significant changes to the proposed rule and regulatory analysis. In addition, the staff's studies of spent fuel storage pool operations led to a decision to encompass spent fuel storage pool operations in the revised rule. Therefore, the staff intends to again issue the rulemaking package for public comment. DISCUSSION: The staff's revised regulatory analysis considered important safety functions and the controls currently in place to ensure these functions. For low-power operation, <b>hot</b> <b>shutdown,</b> and the transition period from hot to cold shutdown, the revised analysis concludes that for these periods important safety functions are protected by existing requirements in standard technical specifications. Accordingly, the revised proposed rule no longer addresses these modes. CONTACT: Timothy Collins, NRR 415 - 2897 For the balance of shutdown operations (cold shutdown and refueling modes), the regulatory analysis shows that the proposed rule provides a substantial increase in the overall protection to public health and safety, and that the costs of the proposed rule are justified in view of the increased protection afforded by the backfit. The analysis found that current controls have evolved through a series of NRC and industry actions initiated for the most part through NRC generic communications. Although these initiatives have been successful in achieving the acceptable level of risk that now exists at U. S. nuclear power plants, the analysis showed that a significant leve...|$|E
40|$|The Browns Ferry {{event was}} of {{sufficient}} significance to warrant {{major changes in}} fire protection design features of NPPs in the United States. Consequently, the NRC issued its new regulation as 10 CFR 50. 48 and Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50, which became effective on February 17, 1981. One of the key requirements of this regulation was to backfit Section III. G, “Fire Protection of Safe Shutdown Capability, ” to all NPPs that were licensed to operate before January 1, 1979. This section establishes the minimum acceptable fire protection design features {{that are necessary to}} ensure that licensees can achieve safe-shutdown in the event of fire in any area of the plant. The fundamental objective of Section III. G is to extend the DID concept to fire safety by obtaining reasonable assurance that, in the event a fire were to start (despite the fire prevention program) and continue to propagate (despite fire protection activities), one train of SSCs needed to achieve and maintain safe-shutdown conditions will remain available. Figure 6 - 1 illustrates how fire damage to circuits and cables may adversely affect the shutdown capability. Figure 6 - 1 Potential Effect of a Fire-Induced Circuit Failure 6 - 1 Section III. G required each licensee to perform a comprehensive evaluation of each fire area and demonstrate, through the performance of a deterministic assessment of potential fire damage, that SSCs of which failure (or maloperation) could impact the ability to achieve and maintain safe-shutdown conditions are provided with suitable fire protection features (i. e., as required by Section III. G. 2 of Appendix R, or justified in a staff-approved exemption). For locations of the plant where compliance with the the fire protection design features specified in Section III. G. 2 may not be feasible because redundant trains of cables and/or equipment are located in close proximity (such as the control room or CSR), Section III. G. 3 requires licensees to provide an alternative or dedicated shutdown capability that is independent (both physically and electrically) from the fire area under consideration. In either case, the evaluation of a fire in any area must conclusively demonstrate that one train of equipment {{that can be used to}} immediately bring the reactor to <b>hot</b> <b>shutdown</b> conditions remains unaffected by fire...|$|E
