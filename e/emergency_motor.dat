40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{goal was}} to {{identify}} predictors of 1 -year outcomes for consecutive patients in a hospital <b>emergency</b> department following <b>motor</b> vehicle accidents and to describe the prevalence and course of four types of psychiatric outcomes after such accidents. METHOD: Consecutive patients aged 17 - 69 years who attended a general hospital emergency department following a motor vehicle accident were identified. Medical information for these patients was extracted from case notes, and the patients completed self-report questionnaires at baseline (soon after the accident), 3 months after the accident, and 1 year after the accident. Measures included a self-report scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and questions about phobic travel anxiety. Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Different frequencies and courses of PTSD, phobic travel anxiety, general anxiety, and depression were reported by a third of the subjects at both 3 -month and 1 -year follow-up. Many of the subjects reported improvements between 3 and 12 months, but others described late onset of psychiatric outcomes after the accident. There were differences in baseline and 3 -month predictors of each type of 1 -year outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The four types of psychiatric outcomes after a motor vehicle accident that were noted overlap, are persistent, and have different early predictors.

40|$|Objective: Age-appropriate {{criteria}} for {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) in young children have been established. The present study investigated the long-term course of such PTSD and its predictors in young children. Methods: Young children (aged 2 – 10 years) and parents/caregivers who had attended <b>emergency</b> departments after <b>motor</b> vehicle collisions (MVCs) between May 2004 and November 2005 were assessed at 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months post-MVC; 71 families were re-interviewed 3 years post-MVC. Participants were assessed according to standard DSM-IV {{criteria for}} PTSD and a well-validated alternative algorithm for diagnosing PTSD in young children (PTSD-AA). Demographic, trauma-related, and parental mental health variables and intellectual ability were also assessed at baseline. Results: Using an “optimal-report” procedure (a positive diagnosis according to parent or child for older children, or just parent for younger children), 7. 0 % met criteria for DSM-IV PTSD and 16. 9 % for PTSD-AA at 3 years. Using parent report alone, these rates were 1. 4 % and 2. 8 %, respectively. Parent-child agreement for PTSD and PTSD-AA was no better than chance (Cohen κ = – 0. 03 and – 0. 04, respectively). Baseline parent posttraumatic stress relating to the child’s trauma, and not trauma severity, was correlated with optimal-report child PTSD-AA at each assessment (r values = 0. 29 – 0. 31) and accounted for unique variance in logistic regression models of this outcome at each assessment.

Para justificar a coexistência do futebol e dos jogos/brincadeiras de bola com os pés num mesmo ecossistema, inicio meu estudo procurando entender como se deu o processo de transição dos jogos/brincadeiras de bola com os pés para o jogo/esporte Futebol, compreendendo que este sofreu e {{continua}} a sofrer constantes ressignificações ao longo dos tempos. Sendo assim, depois de um breve passeio histórico, procuro alicerçar minhas análises, valendo-me de estudos relativos à teoria do jogo. Todavia, o jogo é um fenômeno estudado por distintas áreas do conhecimento, e as leituras dessas inúmeras interpretações e análises, levaram-me a entender o jogo como um ambientado sistema complexo. A partir dessa perspectiva encontro nas unidades complexas (jogos), características sistêmicas integrativas e autoafirmativas. Ou seja, venho evidenciar as semelhanças e as diferenças entre o jogo/esporte Futebol e os demais jogos/brincadeiras de bola com os pés. Para tanto, saí a campo com a intenção de coletar informações junto às brincadeiras com a bola nos pés realizadas por crianças em campos e praças, em momentos de descontração e sem a coação de adultos, ou mesmo a obrigação de se estar lá brincando. Com esses dados pude me aprofundar ainda mais no interior da Família dos jogos de bola com os pés, no intuito de procurar compreender o dinâmico processo organizacional desencadeado no interior de qualquer unidade complexa (jogo), evidenciando suas estruturas sistêmicas e o engendrar de suas interações. Neste estudo as estruturas sistêmicas compreendem as condições externas, as regras, os jogadores e seus esquemas motrizes, e em meio às interações proveniente da tentativa de trazer ordem ao sistema, desordenado pelo jogo, cria-se emergências (condutas motoras), que por sua vez, influencia o desencadear de modificações em todos os demais jogos da Família, gerando um padrão organizacional específico dos jogos de bola com os pés. Essa imersão ao interior das unidades complexas me possibilitou divisar que as semelhanças e as diferenças, não apenas aparentes, existentes entre os jogos/brincadeiras de bola com os pés e o jogo/esporte Futebol, corroboram características de complementaridade, de coexistência. Por intermédio do padrão organizacional desses jogos, pude compreender a relevante produção de diversidade de respostas para as sempre diferentes exigências dos jogos e a possibilidade de transferência dessas emergências produzidas às outras unidades complexas que compartilham situações e exigências semelhantes. In this study, I {{intend to}} present and justify {{the idea that}} soccer and the ball games played with the feet {{belong to the same}} universe belonging to large ecosystem which I call, the family of the games played with the ball on the feet. To justify the coexistence of the soccer and the games played with the ball on the feet in one ecosystem, I begun my study searching to understand how did the transition process from the games with the ball on the feet to the game of soccer happened, understanding that this process suffered and continues to suffer constant ressignificacoes during {{the past and the present}} time. Thus, after a brief historical review, I look for base my analyses, with studies relative to games theory. Game is a phenomenon studied for distinct areas of the knowledge, and the readings of these innumerable interpretations and analyses has helped me to understand the game as a complex environment system. In this perspective I find in the complex units (games), integrative systemic and auto-affirmative characteristics. Therefore I search to evidence the similarities and the differences between the soccer game and the other games played with the ball on the feet. For this reason, I collect information of games played with the ball on the feet played by the children in open fields and playgrounds in moments of freedom and without the coercion of adults or with the obligation of the children for being there to play. With these data I could go deepen in the interior of the family of the games played with the ball on the feet with the intention to try to understand the dynamic unchained organizational process in the interior of any complex unit (game), this way evidencing its systemic structures and the production of its interactions. In this study the systemic structures are the external conditions, the rules, players and its motor esquemas, and among the interactions proceeding from the attempts to bring order to the system, disordered because of the game, it is created <b>emergencies</b> (<b>motor</b> behaviors), that in turn, influences unchaining of modifications in all the games of the family of the games played with the ball on the feet, producing a specific organizational standard of the games played with ball on the feet. This immersion to the interior of the complex units made possible to delimit that the similarities and the differences, not only apparent but the ones that really exists between the games of ball played with the feet and the soccer game, corroborates characteristics of coexistence and complementaridade. With the intermediation of the organizational standard of these games, I could understand that the excellent diversity production of answers for different requirements of the games and the possibility of transference of these emergencies produced to the other complex units that share similar situations and requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{control system}} was {{developed}} to control, acquire and process {{the data from the}} specially designed Roll Damping Rig to measure the roll damping derivatives of aerospace vehicle models. Steady roll technique was used for these measurements in the NAL 1. 2 m wind tunnel. The earlier control system was configured on two separate computers, viz. one for speed control and the other for data acquisition and processing of the rolling moment data. The system required certain important parameter entries to be duplicated exactly in both the computers for synchronization of speed and acquisition of the rolling moment data. Certain other data related to the speed information were needed to be transferred from one PC to the other after the blowdown for data processing. In the new approach some modifications were made to the existing control, data acquisition and processing programs to run simultaneously in one PC. Additional features were incorporated for better performance and easy handling of the programs, and the necessary data for processing is internally transferred from one program to the other. A feature is incorporated to automatically control and acquire the data for both pre-tare and wind-on and store them with separate filenames for processing. <b>Emergency</b> signals from <b>motor</b> controller, ITCS and manual emergency were provided to stop the motor and to stop the blowdown.

The aims {{of this study were}} to provide a profile of patients with PD who required admission to hospital and to determine the reasons for emergency admission. Patients and methods: Between September 1 st, 2004 and August 31 st, 2006, patients with PD who were admitted to our emergency department (ED) were included in the study. Patients with PD who were diagnosed by a neurologist formerly, and admitted to the ED with any reason constituted the study population. Demographical data, reasons for admission, years exposed to PD, number of admissions to the emergency department in the past 12 months, prior Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) scores were recorded. H&amp;Y was performed again for all patients 4 weeks after discharge. Results: Seventy-six patients with PD were included in the study. Reasons for admission to hospital were infectious diseases (31. 6 %), trauma (27. 6 %), cardiovascular emergencies (14. 5 %), cerebrovascular emergencies (11. 8 %), gastrointestinal emergencies (7. 9 %), and electrolyte disturbances (6. 6 %), respectively. There was no dependence between the time of exposure to PD and H&amp;Y score. Number of emergency admittance in the last 12 months was independent from the last H&amp;Y score (p = 0. 297). However, there was a dependency between the reasons for emergency admittance and the H&amp;Y scores (p = 0. 023).

O consumo maior foi em vítimas de atropelamentos (60 %), (N = 9), acidente de trânsito (40 %), (N = 40) e acidentes gerais (44 %), (N = 51), entre indivíduos do sexo masculino, solteiros, com idade entre 18 e 44 anos (mediana 36). A análise de regressão logística indicou que embora o uso abusivo de álcool esteja mais associado ao grupo de traumas físicos, essa relação é especialmente importante com os pedestres (OR = 1, 05 IC 95 %: 1, 01 - 1, 09) e os acidentes gerais (agressões, quedas, afogamentos, entre outros) (OR = 1, 03 IC 95 %: 1, 00 - 1, 05). CONCLUSÕES: O consumo abusivo de bebidas alcoólicas entre os pacientes atendidos neste serviço de PS em decorrência de acidentes de transporte e outros tipos de acidentes é elevado, especialmente no que diz respeito aos atropelamentos. Nesse sentido, são indispensáveis medidas preventivas para diminuir o custo {{individual}} e social do consumo de álcool e a reincidência desses eventos. BACKGROUND: The abusive {{alcoholic beverage}} use {{is one of}} significant the provoking factors of external causes in patients taken care of in the emergency. OBJECTIVES: To describe the {{patterns of alcohol use}} among patients attended at the Emergency Department and to investigate the association of patterns of alcohol use and the reasons for seeking the emergency health care. METHODS: It is a transversal study. A sample was made of 418 patients who seek treatment at the emergency room of Federal University of Uberlândia (HCUFU/MG), from October 2003 through March 2004. The procedures consisted of gathering some socio demographic figures, general figures about the main reasons to search for health service and a tracing questionnaire for alcohol abuse developed by World Health Organization, the AUDIT - The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. RESULTS: The prevalence of harmful alcohol use among the sample was 36. 2 % (N = 151). Higher rates of alcohol abuse were found among run over victims (60 %), (N = 9), victims of motor accidents (40 %), (N = 40), victims of general accidents (44 %), (N = 51), and were related to being male, single, and aged 18 to 44. The analysis of logistic regression indicated that, though harmful alcohol use is associated with all trauma groups investigated, this relation was particularly significant for run over victims (OR = 1, 05 IC 95 %: 1, 01 - 1, 09) and victims of general accidents (OR = 1, 03 IC 95 %: 1, 00 - 1, 05). DISCUSSION: Alcohol consumption is high among patients seen at <b>emergency</b> rooms due <b>motor</b> vehicle and other kinds of accidents, particularly for run over victims. In this sense it is of paramount importance to implement preventive measures to decrease individual and social costs that alcohol consumption imposes to its users...|$|R
