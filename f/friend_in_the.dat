5|$|Euler's {{interest}} in number theory {{can be traced}} to the influence of Christian Goldbach, his <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.|$|E
5|$|Jackson, {{leading the}} new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton {{resigned}} his Senate seat to accept appointment as Jackson's Secretary of War. The appointment was seemingly made because of Jackson's {{desire to have}} a personal <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet in whom he could confide.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder. His closest <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House was his military aide Harry H. Vaughan, who seemed to others like a huge joke.|$|E
500|$|Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North {{has been}} invoked on several {{occasions}} as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television. The year following Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norths broadcast, Tony Marchant's drama serial Holding On was promoted by the BBC as being an [...] "Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South," [...] after Marchant made the comparison when discussing it with executives. The 2001 BBC Two drama serial In a Land of Plenty was previewed by The Observer newspaper as being [...] "the most ambitious television drama since Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North." [...] The writer Paula Milne drew inspiration from Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North for her own White Heat (2012); she felt that Our <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North had been too centred on white, male, heterosexual characters, and she deliberately wanted to counter that focus.|$|R

5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{continued}} playing small roles {{throughout the}} early 1990s. After appearing in Joey Breaker and the critically panned teen zombie picture My Boyfriend's Back, {{he had a}} more notable role playing John Cusack's wealthy <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crime comedy Money for Nothing. In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller The Getaway, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman. He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by Paul Newman– one of Hoffman's acting idols– in the drama Nobody's Fool.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh's seven-year-old son, Gautham Krishna, {{was chosen}} to play the younger version of the protagonist in his Telugu cinema debut. According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor did as a child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive. His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy was afraid of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E

5|$|Drewett {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1884, causing {{the boys to}} be uprooted as they {{went to live with}} Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading {{literature}} and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.|$|E
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Germans {{occupied}} Oslo and at 17:30 Norwegian radio ceased broadcasting at {{the request}} of the occupying forces. With German support, at approximately 19:30, Quisling entered the NRK studios in Oslo and proclaimed the formation of a new government with himself as Prime Minister. He also revoked an earlier order to mobilise against the German invasion. He still lacked legitimacy. Two orders—the first, to a <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military (Colonel Hans S. Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum) to arrest the government, and the second, to the Oslo chief of police—were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours. Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the Bolærne fortress. As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a puppet government had been part of the German plan all along.|$|E

5|$|On the {{completion}} of his extra year learning Arabic at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service. He continued to play cricket for Somerset during his periods of leave, but it dramatically reduced his availability for the county. During his time at Oxford, Seamer had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset. When Mitchell-Innes graduated from Oxford the year after Seamer, he joined his <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sudan, where the pair often organised cricket matches, despite the extreme heat. Seamer's duties prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1937, but he appeared eight times the following year through May and early June. His average that season was the highest he achieved after leaving university, recording 20.78 from his 14 innings, though his highest score was 47 runs, scored against Derbyshire. In 1939, the last season of first-class county cricket in England before the Second World War, Seamer played seven times for Somerset. However, unlike his appearances the previous year, {{in which he had}} generally batted as part of the top order, Seamer predominantly appeared in the middle order for the county in 1939, and his highest score was 28.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kagame {{was still}} in the United States {{at the time of the}} {{outbreak}} of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September, Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa, eventually arriving at Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by a <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country, and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border, and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|Three endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, {{has already}} bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, Juste escapes the {{collapsing}} castle alone and curses {{his inability to}} save either <b>friend.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins {{the same as the}} first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights Juste, planning to use his blood to return himself to full power. Vanquishing him, Juste escapes the castle together with Maxim and Lydie, whose bite marks disappear by the time she regains consciousness. Outside the castle, the three resolve to return home.|$|E

5|$|When Priestley's friend Theophilus Lindsey {{decided to}} found a new Christian {{denomination}} that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid. On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first Unitarian service in Britain, at the newly formed Essex Street Chapel in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley defended his <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pamphlet Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church (1774), claiming that only the form of worship had been altered, not its substance, and attacking those who followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended Lindsey's church regularly in the 1770s and occasionally preached there. He continued to support institutionalised Unitarianism {{for the rest of}} his life, writing several Defenses of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Yasui had {{consulted}} a <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal minds {{to try to}} test {{the legality of the}} orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine.|$|E
