40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} amounts of remaining sulfite in fruits after treatment with SP (sodium sulfite solution adjusted its pH to 5. 5 with ortho phosphoric acid), colorimetric method with rosanilin∙HCl-formaldehyde reagent was investigated. Into 10 ml sample solution, 1 ml 0. 04 % rosanilin dissolved in 6 % HCl and 1 ml 0. 2 % formaldehyde {{were added to}} develop red-violet color. Intensity of color was estimated by determining optical density of the solution at 580 mμ. Color development is rapid and reaches to constant value in a few minutes. However, this should be carried out at least at room temperature, since color intensity was decreased at 37 ℃. Usually SP had been employed for treatment of fruits with sulfite. Phosphoric acid had not notable influence on color development. Thus, as indicated in Fig. 3, proportionality of optical density at 580 mμ to concentration of sulfite was established. In addition, {{it was observed that}} apple juice does not disturb the estimation of sulfite, except that color intensity of sulfite added into apple juice is decreased as judged from standard curve with Na_ 2 SO_ 3 solution. This decrease might be attributed to the reaction of sulfite with some native substances in apple, as supposed from protection of brownning of apple with SP. Thus, rosanilin∙HCl-formaldehyde reagent was proved to be useful for the determination of sulfite in fruit and juice of apple. On the other hand, juice of astringent variety of <b>kaki</b> (<b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon),</b> even without sulfite, developed blue-violet color having the absorption maximum at 590 mμ and produced precipitate. However, the juice of sweet variety of kaki as well as tannic acid developed red-violet color as with sulfite, but not produced precipitate. Owing to these coloration, it was concluded that kaki disturbed the colorimetric method of estimating sulfite with rosanilin∙HCl-formaldehyde reagent. In addition, it was observed that blue-violet coloration and precipitation were brought about only with flesh astringent kaki. When fruit of astringent variety was naturally matured, the color developed was red-violet as with sweet variety. Similar red-violet coloration was also recognized with astringent kaki which had been treated with alcohol or dried to remove astringency. Then, polarography of sulfite was investigated to find out the suitable method estimating sulfite in kaki. A mixture of 6 or 3 ml 10 ^- 3 M Na_ 2 SO_ 3, 5 ml McIlvaine buffer (10 ^- 1 M citric acid～ 2 × 10 ^- 1 M Na_ 2 HPO_ 4) of pH 3 and 4 ml or 7 ml H_ 2 O was employed for estimation of polarogram and the typical one of sulfite having half-wave potential at - 0. 7 volt was determined. Furthermore, it was observed that wave height has the direct relationship with concentration of sulfite. As shown in Fig. 10, the standard calibration curve of sulfite was obtained from wave height of polarograms with various concentrations of sulfite. When the mixture was acidified with phosphoric acid in stead of McIlvaine buffer, polarogram of sulfite was also determined. However, a maximum wave was detected in the polarogram, although it has half-wave potential at - 0. 671 ～- 0. 70 volt. Using the condition just established, at pH 3 with McIlvaine buffer, the distinct reduction wave of sulfite in juice of kaki was estimated, while definite polarogram could not be determined when it was estimated at pH 6 or 8. Some weak reduction waves of constituents in kaki were checked, whereas no waves were recognized in polarogram of apple juice. At any rate, it was established that juice of fruits of kaki and apple does not disturb the polarographic estimation of sulfite which should be carried out at pH 3 adjusted with McIlvaine buffer.

5000|$|Asian or <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon</b> (Diospyros <b>kaki)</b> is {{native to}} Japan, China, Korea, Burma and Nepal. [...] It is deciduous, with broad, stiff leaves, and {{is known as the}} shizi (柿子 in Chinese), and also as the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Persimmon</b> or <b>kaki</b> (柿) in <b>Japanese.</b> It is the most widely {{cultivated}} species. Its fruits are sweet and slightly tangy with a soft to occasionally fibrous texture. Cultivation of the fruit extended first to other parts of east Asia, India and Nepal and was later introduced to California and southern Europe in the 1800s and to Brazil in the 1890s, and numerous cultivars have been selected. It is edible in its crisp, firm state but has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest. The Japanese cultivar 'Hachiya' is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like 'Hachiya' must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit comprises thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.|$|R

30|$|The {{amount of}} boron {{contained}} in the xylem of <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon</b> (Diospyros <b>kaki</b> Thunb.) and ebony (Diospyros ebenum Koen) was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry and a modified curcumin—acetic acid method. The boron content was compared between the heartwood and sapwood of ebony {{as well as between}} a blackened portion (“kurogaki”) and normal portion of <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon.</b> The kurogaki contained a higher level of boron than the normal portion of the same individual, although the boron content varied among individuals. Moreover, the boron content of the heartwood of ebony was much higher than that of the sapwood. These results suggest the participation of boron in the blackening of <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon.</b> Because both kurogaki and heartwood of ebony are durable to fungal attack, the blackening of Diospyros genus appears {{to be related to the}} formation of defensive substances in which boron seems to take part. The convenient curcumin—acetic acid method is an alternative to the ICP method with comparable accuracy.|$|R

30|$|The {{heartwood}} of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon</b> tree (Diospyros <b>kaki)</b> becomes {{black on}} rare occasions and has been highly esteemed {{as a substitute for}} ebony. We attempted to clarify how the physical, mechanical, chemical, and biodegradation properties differ between sapwood and blackened heartwood. The specific gravity, equilibrium moisture content, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity in the blackened heartwood were higher, and the loss tangent was lower, than those in sapwood. Furthermore, the blackened portion was more resistant to fungal and termite attacks. A section of heartwood was dark-brown, and the specific gravity and mechanical properties of this portion were slightly lower than those in sapwood. The dark-brown portion was speculated to be a sign or interrupted state of fungal attack. The blackening substance was bound tightly to cell wall components and could not be extracted with any of the organic solvents used. The findings of trace element analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry showed that the boron content was markedly high in the blackened portion. The findings obtained here suggest a role of boron in the antifungal properties and the blackening phenomenon of <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon.</b>|$|R

40|$|Field grown ‘Tonewase’ <b>Japanese</b> <b>persimmon</b> {{had been}} {{cultivated}} {{as a leading}} persimmon variety in Wakayama Prefecture without any problem until 1993. Thereafter, however, a rapid fruit softening during postharvest distribution occurred and its rate increased every year coinciding with retardation of the temperature decrease in September which is the ripening season for the fruit. This produced a serious loss to the Prefecture. We clarified the mechanism of this fruit softening and developed a completely suppressible technique based on that mechanism. 　In ‘Tonewase’ persimmon fruit, water stress acted as a primary signal that triggered stress-ethylene production in the tissue of calyx through stimulating the expression {{of one of the}} ACC synthase genes, DK-ACS 2, a stress responsible ethylene biosynthetic gene. This ethylene diffused into pulp tissue of the fruit, where transcription of DK-ACS 1 for ripening-ethylene production was activaled through a positive feedback system, which in turn caused rapid fruit softening. 　This fruit softening derived from stress-ethylene was completely suppressed by packaging the fruit in perforated polyethylene bags or by using carton boxes laminated with a thin layer of plastic film. These techniques that alleviated water loss from fruit completely solved the rapid softening problem during postharvest distribution in ‘Tonewase’ fruit...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{techniques}} (RAPD and i-PBS) {{were used}} to study genetic diversity within persimmon collection at Horticulture Faculty of Mendel University in Lednice. The aim of the work was to distinguish 14 known and 6 of unknown origin persimmon cultivars. The basic screening of 20 OPT primers was applied to 4 cultivars differring {{in the place of}} origin. Within the group of screened primers there were chosen those, which gave polymorphic repeatable strong and middle strong bands. Selected primers were used for the RAPD reactions within the whole persimmon collection. Three OPA primers previously described in the literature were also used for the RAPD reactions within the whole persimmon collection. Additional 16 i-PBS primers previously described in the literature were also used for i-PBS analysis of the whole group of cultivars. Amplification was successful with 12 i-PBS primers. The FreeTree software package was used to gen­erate a similarity matrix and then to produce a dendrogram using UPGMA analyses. The similarity dendrograms of all persimmon cultivars were created based on both approaches and also on combination of both analyses by program Tree View. All the dendrograms clearly separated the assessed cultivars into 4 clusters. There are cluster of American persimmons – Meader’ (1), ’Garretson’ (2) and ’Early Golden’ (3).
