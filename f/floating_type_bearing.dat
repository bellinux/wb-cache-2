40|$|Aero and Vibroacoustics of Automotive Turbochargers {{is a topic}} {{involving}} aspects {{from the}} working fields of thermodynamics of turbomachinery, aerodynamics, rotordynamics, and noise propagation computation.   In this broadly interdisciplinary subject, thermodynamics of turbomachinery is used to design the turbocharger and to determine its operating conditions.  Aerodynamics is needed to study the compressor flow dynamics and flow instabilities of rotating stall and surge, which can produce growling and whining-type noises. Rotordynamics is necessary to study rotor unbalance and self-excited oil-whirl instabilities, which lead to whistling and constant tone-type noises in rotating <b>floating</b> oil-film <b>type</b> <b>bearings.</b> For the special case of turbochargers using ball bearings, some high-order harmonic and wear noises also manifest in the rotor operating range. Lastly, noise propagation computation, based on Lighthill’s analogy, is required to investigate airborne noises produced by turbochargers in passenger vehicles. The content of this book is intended for advanced undergraduates, graduates in mechanical engineering, research scientists and practicing engineers who want {{to better understand the}} interactions between these working fields and the resulting impact on the interesting topic of Aero and Vibroacoustics of Automotive Turbochargers...|$|R

Then, the following two profits were obtained: 1). The pulsatory motion of water flow, one of defects of the fixed <b>float</b> <b>type</b> paddle wheel, was not observed with the new movable <b>float</b> <b>type</b> and the velocity of water flow gave a value 10 ~ 30 % larger than that obtainable before. 2).

40|$|Vascular {{invasion}} of gastric carcinoma were studied in 102 cases of resected stomach cancer from {{view of the}} connective tissue's proliferation. 1) Blood vessel invasion were classified in three types, as follows: Extraluminal type, Embolus <b>type</b> and <b>Floating</b> <b>type.</b> Extraluminal type included {{invasion of}} tumor cell out of intima. The common type of blood vessel invasion in well diff. adenocarcinoma were embolus and <b>floating</b> <b>type,</b> while in poorly diff. adenocarcinoma were extraluminal type. 2) The lymph vessel invasion were more prominent in poorly diff. adenocarcinoma. 3) From electron microscopic observation of connective tissue's proliferation, in medullary carcinoma, embolus and <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> were more frequently than extraluminal type. Conversely, in scirrhous carcinoma. Extraluminal type was the most common. These findings indicated that type of vascular invasion might be strongly affected not only by cancerous proliferation but also by connective tissue's proliferation...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Float</b> <b>type</b> carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the <b>float</b> <b>type</b> carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts {{toward the top of}} the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{performs}} a comprehensive and comparative {{evaluation of the}} state of the art local features for the task of image based 3 D reconstruction. The evaluated local features cover the recently developed ones by using powerful machine learning techniques and the elaborately designed handcrafted features. To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, we choose to include both <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features and binary ones. Meanwhile, two kinds of datasets have been used in this evaluation. One is a dataset of many different scene types with groundtruth 3 D points, containing images of different scenes captured at fixed positions, for quantitative performance evaluation of different local features in the controlled image capturing situations. The other dataset contains Internet scale image sets of several landmarks with a lot of unrelated images, which is used for qualitative performance evaluation of different local features in the free image collection situations. Our experimental results show that binary features are competent to reconstruct scenes from controlled image sequences with only a fraction of processing time compared to use <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features. However, for the case of large scale image set with many distracting images, <b>float</b> <b>type</b> features show a clear advantage over binary ones...|$|R

As a background of this study, Goto City is an island municipality and suffering from depopulation because of low birth rate and longevity, and also, due to economic slide and decrease in employment. Goto City started the pilot project of <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> {{offshore wind power}} generation in 2009, supported by the Ministry of Environment.

Next, out of several issues, this study focuses on the initial cost and considers how they can collect investment for expanding <b>floating</b> <b>type</b> offshore wind power generation. This article also refers to the possibility of communal investment as one of the ways to contribute to local revitalization.
