5|$|Leotia lubrica is {{the type}} species of the genus Leotia. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that the species has a close {{relationship}} with L.atrovirens; mycologist Geoffrey Kibby suggested that greenish color of L.atrovirens may be due to infection by an imperfect fungus on L.lubrica, while David Arora proposed that the two species may intergrade. In 2004, results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that L.lubrica, L.atrovirens and L.viscosa, while morphologically well-defined, were not monophyletic. L.lubrica specimens could be split into at least two different groups, one of which also contained specimens of L.viscosa. These groups could be differentiated morphologically by the colour of the stalk when dried. The most basal was shown to be L.atrovirens.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the cicada males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas that are on average 88% heavier than their own body mass. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight.

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela is {{a member}} of the genus Myzomela which includes two other Australian species, the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia, and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia. It belongs to the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal myzomelas, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the red-headed myzomela diverged from that of the black-breasted myzomela around 4 million years ago, however the relationships of many species within the genus is uncertain. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Because the red-headed myzomela occurs on many offshore islands and appears to be an effective water-crosser, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that north-western Australia was the primary centre of origin for the two subspecies.|$|E

25|$|Crematogaster brevispinosa rochai is one {{subspecies}} of ant whose {{interaction with}} N. corniger has been studied. C. b. rochai lives {{in areas of}} caatinga in Brazil.

The ants and termites are segregated within the nest and do not normally come into contact with each other. C. b. rochai plug channels at the boundary of the areas they occupy to cause this segregation.

500|$|Sir Matthew Hale [...] (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an {{influential}} English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died {{by the time}} he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform.

Essentially, this explanation says that the absolute amount of the endowment is not significant enough to produce strategically optimal behaviour. However, many experiments have been performed where the amount offered was substantial: studies by Cameron and Hoffman et al. have found that higher stakes cause offers to approach closer to an even split, even in a 100 USD game played in Indonesia, where average per-capita income is much lower than in the United States. Rejections are reportedly independent of the stakes at this level, with 30 USD offers being turned down in Indonesia, as in the United States, even though this equates to two weeks' wages in Indonesia. However, 2011 research with stakes of up to 40 weeks' wages in India showed that [...] "as stakes increase, rejection rates approach zero".|$|E

The alignment technique combines a feature-based method (initialisation and refinement) with rough motion segmentation followed by a colour-based direct method (final adjustment). This precise frame-to-frame alignment allows the dynamic building of a background representation as well as an e#cient segmentation of each image such that moving regions of arbitrary shape and size are aligned with the static background...|$|R

[...] The crater is located at a depth of 1.6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica. The scientists speculate that this impact may have caused the Permian–Triassic extinction event, although its age is bracketed only between 100 million and 500 million years ago. They also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass, which were both part of a supercontinent called Gondwana. Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian-Triassic layer do not approach those of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer. Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former, doubt is cast on the significance of a meteorite impact in creating the latter. Further doubt has been cast on this theory based on fossils in Greenland that show the extinction to have been gradual, lasting about eighty thousand years, with three distinct phases.|$|E
2500|$|Somatic {{epigenetic}} inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and nucleosome repositioning, is {{very important}} in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogens activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" [...] and [...] "multipotency"). In mammals, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in neurogenesis, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require [...] "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Neovascularization of tendon {{is one of}} the {{characteristics}} in patellar tendinopathy. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that the vessels or the nerves accompanying the vessels were involved in the pain mechanism in this chronic pathology. [Cook, 2004] Due to the different methods used to categorise or quantify the vascularity change by researchers [Hoksrud, 2009], the relationship between vascularity and pain is still controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} correlate findings on vascularity using power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) and pain measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) in patients with patellar tendinopathy. Methods PDU was performed on thirty-five jumping athletes (age range: 18 – 35 years, mean age 22. 9 years) with patellar tendinopathy (21 unilateral, 14 bilateral). The vascularity was quantified using ultrasound images by a customised software program. Vascular index (VI) was calculated as the ratio of the number of colour pixels to the total number of pixels within a standardised selected area of proximal patellar tendon. The higher VI, the more vascular is the region. The tendons were further categorised into minimal- or moderate-vascularized groups with reference to classification rated by an experienced sonographer. The athlete then rated their knee pain level using VAS on a 10 -cm continuous line marked “no pain” on one end and “worst pain” on the other, recalling the maximal pain level during activities in the last 7 days. Results Tendons VI were positively correlated to pain level in both groups (r = 0. 49; p = 0. 03 in minimal-vascularized group; r = 0. 57; p = 0. 03 in moderate-vascularized group). However, when combining both groups, the correlation was not significant (r = 0. 26, p = 0. 14). Discussion The computerised vascular index could be one of the indicators to reflect the severity or subjective pain level of athletes suffering from patellar tendinopathy. This study suggested that categorization was indicated to reflect this correlation. The pain mechanism in tendinopathy might be different in tendons with minimal- or moderate-vascularisation.

40|$|The gene dense major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) region, present in all jawed vertebrates, encodes molecules involved in self-non-self discrimination and the binding and presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells during the adaptive immune response. Variation in MHC genes {{is thought to be}} driven largely by pathogen-mediated selection, with diversity at MHC loci believed to benefit populations by allowing responses to rapidly evolving disease pathogens. However, in economically important dairy cattle, there are concerns that intensive selection for production and fitness traits may override natural selection. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hypothesised</b> that these focussed dairy breeding practices may lead to a reduction in MHC diversity and leave cattle populations susceptible to new disease pathogens. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate current levels of MHC class I diversity in the UK Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle population, primarily through the assessment of diversity in bull populations with genetic input into the UK herd. In a sample of Canadian Holstein bulls, levels of class I allelic diversity were low given the size of the population sampled, but no significant loss of diversity over a twenty year period of selection was detected. Simulations of gene flow implicated trait selection as an influential force shaping diversity in the Canadian Holstein bull population. Haplotypes detected at high frequency were often negatively associated with selection traits indicating the action of heterozygote advantage. A SNP-based assay <b>has</b> <b>been</b> designed to facilitate rapid detection of common haplotypes and thus enable breeders to make more efficient selective breeding decisions whilst also maintaining MHC diversity in cattle populations. Investigations of class I diversity were expanded to incorporate the British Friesian bull population which <b>were</b> shown to <b>have</b> a markedly different pattern of class I diversity to that observed in the Canadian Holstein sample. A number of novel allele sequences and haplotypes were detected in the British Friesian bulls, the characterisation of which has contributed to our knowledge of the mechanisms driving diversity in the cattle class I region. MHC class I typing data from two bull populations and statistical analysis of trait associations with MHC haplotypes provides a comprehensive picture of MHC class I diversity in the wider UK herd and the selective forces integral to shaping diversity.

Passive heating allows one to obtain the increase in muscle or core temperature achieved by active warm up without depleting energy substrates.
