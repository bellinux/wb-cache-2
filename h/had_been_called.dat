5|$|Altgens {{and former}} Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston {{a short time}} later. Connally told Altgens that he also <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> to testify and {{received}} airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens later learned {{that they were not}} required to attend.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate in 1941, {{representing}} Union, Webster, and Henderson counties. By 1944, he had risen to the post of majority leader in that body and {{played a central role in}} writing the state's budget that year. Due to Clements' efforts, educational appropriations were increased far above what <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> for by Republican governor Simeon Willis.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E

5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> to extract the others.|$|E
5|$|Bohr died {{of heart}} failure {{at his home in}} Carlsberg on 18 November 1962. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.|$|E

5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers. The government <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E

Within three months Lock <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September, a large {{batch of}} reservists were given orders for mobilization. To lull suspicion, the Cabinet Ministers of the Egyptian Government {{were invited to}} an open tour of General Headquarters, where all {{planning}} and coordination of the operation took place. Another batch of reservists were called up on September 30. To quell suspicion once more, the Egyptians publicly announced on 4 October the demobilization of the reservists who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> up on 27 September, but only demobilized 20,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Poland did {{not follow}} up this victory {{politically}} or militarily. A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the right to tax Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% {{of the value of}} goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic coast. Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion.|$|E
5|$|The Oak Room at the Algonquin {{was long}} one of New York City's premier cabaret nightclubs.

5|$|The {{two main}} Christian forces that {{marched to the}} Holy Land in {{response}} to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Conrad's force included Bolesław IV the Curly and Vladislaus II of Bohemia, as well as Frederick of Swabia, his nephew who would become Emperor Frederick I. The crusade <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> {{after the fall of}} the County of Edessa on 24 December 1144.

5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought a losing battle to retain them.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R.

McBride <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges.

5|$|Following the 39th Battalion's {{return to}} Australia, {{the men were}} given a period of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Initially, {{the plan was to}} reorganise the brigade and rebuild it prior to {{returning}} it to New Guinea, but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and 3rd Battalions—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent to the 16th and 19th Brigades. This came into effect on 3 July 1943 {{and as a result of}} this decision, the Militiamen that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>called</b> up for service were transferred to the 36th Battalion, a Militia battalion from New South Wales, while those who had volunteered for overseas service were sent to the 2/2nd Battalion; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.|$|E
