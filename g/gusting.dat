5|$|The December 1960 nor'easter was a {{significant}} early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10in (25cm) or more in parts of 13states and peaking at 21.4in (54.4cm) at Newark, New Jersey. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, <b>gusting</b> to over 90mph (145km/h) in coastal New England, and left in its wake a dangerously cold air mass. The storm originated in a weak low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10.

40|$|Analysis of {{spacecraft}} vehicle {{responses to}} atmospheric wind <b>gusts</b> during flight {{is important in}} the establishment of vehicle design structural requirements and operational capability. Typically, wind <b>gust</b> models can be either a spectral type determined by a random process having a wide range of wavelengths, or a discrete type having a single <b>gust</b> of predetermined magnitude and shape. Classical discrete models used by NASA during the Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs included a 9 m/sec quasi-square-wave <b>gust</b> with variable wavelength from 60 to 300 m. A later study derived discrete <b>gust</b> from a military specification (MIL-SPEC) document that used a " 1 -cosine" shape. The MIL-SPEC document contains a curve of non-dimensional <b>gust</b> magnitude as a function of non-dimensional <b>gust</b> half-wavelength based on the Dryden spectral model, but fails to list the equation necessary to reproduce the curve. Therefore, previous studies could only estimate a value of <b>gust</b> magnitude from the curve, or attempt to fit a function to it.

5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds <b>gusting</b> up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions.

In order to design an efficient <b>gust</b> load alleviation system that respects the actuation constraints of the control surfaces, uses preview information on the incoming <b>gust</b> shape from a Light Detection And Ranging <b>gust</b> sensor and takes <b>gust</b> propagation delays into account, we apply model predictive control to an aeroservoelastic aircraft model...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gusts</b> may be {{predicted}} by the same value that serves as an exponent for wind shear, serving as a <b>gust</b> factor. So, one can expect <b>gusts</b> to be about 1.5 times stronger than the prevailing wind speed (a 10-knot wind might <b>gust</b> up to 15 knots). This, combined with changes in wind direction suggest {{the degree to which}} a sailing craft must adjust sail angle to wind <b>gusts</b> on a given course.|$|R
40|$|There {{is as yet}} no {{standard}} {{methodology for}} measuring wind <b>gusts</b> from a moving platform. To address this, we have developed a method to derive <b>gusts</b> from research aircraft data. First we evaluated four different approaches, including Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen turbulence, to derive the <b>gust</b> length scales that correspond to the <b>gust</b> time scales, namely, the <b>gust</b> duration (seconds) and the sample period (typically 10 min). The novelty of our method is in using peak factors (deviation of the <b>gust</b> from the mean wind speed normalized by the local turbulence) to convert between the scales. After devising a way to derive the <b>gust</b> length scales, we calculated the <b>gust</b> factors from aircraft observations and tested them against those from four parameterizations originally developed for weather stations. Three of them performed well (R 2 = 0. 66 or higher), while the fourth overestimated the <b>gust</b> factors in unstable conditions(R 2 = 0. 52). The mean errors for all methods were low, from - 0. 02 to 0. 05, indicating that wind <b>gust</b> factors can indeed be measured from research aircraft. Moreover, we showed that aircraft can provide <b>gust</b> measurements within the whole boundary layer, if horizontal legs are flown at multiple levels over the same track. This is a significant advance, as <b>gust</b> measurements are usually limited to heights reached by weather masts. In unstable conditions over the open ocean the <b>gust</b> factor was nearly constant with height throughout the boundary layer, the near-surface values only slightly exceeding those at upper levels. Furthermore, we found <b>gust</b> factors to be strongly dependent on surface roughness conditions, which differed between the open ocean and sea ice in the Arctic marine environment. The roughness effect on the <b>gust</b> factor was stronger than the effect of boundary-layer stability...|$|R
