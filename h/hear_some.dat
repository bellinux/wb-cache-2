25|$|On 24 June 1965, Jarry Park {{hosted the}} great show on Saint John Baptiste Day, (La Saint-Jean Baptiste), the French-Canadian annual celebration day. Since 1977 {{it is now}} officially called Quebec's National Holiday, (La fête {{nationale}} du Québec). That year, Jarry Park was chosen to present the most important event of the celebrations. 40,000 people came to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of Québec's most acclaimed singers; namely Pauline Julien, Clémence Desrochers, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Christine Charbonneau, Hervé Brousseau, Les Cailloux, Pierre Calvé, Renée Claude et Pierre Létourneau.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair {{took place}} in Bethel, New York, which for many, {{exemplified}} the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Carlos Santana, Sly & The Family Stone, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred {{in other parts of}} the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with. Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E

25|$|Both {{before and}} since DAB launched, other mediums of {{transmitting}} {{and listening to}} the radio have expanded. In 1989, cable television subscribers in the Saltash area could <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> BBC Radio stations on their television sets for the first time. With the expansion of digital cable television, many more radio stations have been added. With the expansion of satellite television too, many stations, including others from the European continent and beyond are available. The BBC added radio to UK Gold in 1993 on the Astra satellite, and subsequent satellites and services have been extended since then. The expansion of Freeview, and its subsequent replacement in Cornwall in 2009 of existing analogue television services is perhaps going to have the greatest impact. The internet, with thousands of radio stations streaming online, and the expansion of broadband has meant that radio reception has diversified in the number of stations that can be heard, and it is no longer restricted to crackles and night time fading of a few stations of old.|$|E
500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings {{was once again}} mindful of his audience, prefacing {{the coverage of the}} Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. [...] "You may <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> not very nice language," [...] said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, [...] "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more." [...] Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, Experimental Jet Set was {{produced}} by the band and alternative rock veteran Butch Vig. According to the band, [...] "The idea this time was to cut {{as much of it}} live as we could, and not labor over polishing and overdubbing in the usual big-rock manner." [...] Similarly, guitarist Lee Ranaldo explained that the band wanted to achieve a more lo-fi approach: [...] "None of [...] music was labored, some of it was done in people's bedrooms, even. [...] to write the songs and record them simply and basically." [...] Additionally, the band ordered Vig to refrain from his desire to apply a buzz remover to several tracks. The album was engineered by John Siket and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. The band claimed that the album was recorded over the master tapes of Sister to save costs, and it is possible to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> parts of Sister during quiet sections of the final recording. The album was recorded on a two-inch 16-track analog tape recorder through antiquated equipment.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in persuading his boss, Roy Featherstone, and Ron White, authoriser of EMI recordings, to allow Barrett to record {{with the company}} again. In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: [...] "What was decided was {{to see what was}} the strength of Syd's new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we'd do an album. If not, we'd call it a day..." [...] In a meeting at Barrett's flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner's production technique, Jones asked to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of the previous year's tapes; Barrett played him [...] "Swan Lee", [...] "Late Night", [...] "Rhamadam", [...] "Lanky (Parts One and Two)" [...] and [...] "Golden Hair". Of these, [...] "Swan Lee" [...] had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; [...] "Late Night" [...] did have vocals and, Jones remarked, [...] "a certain charm"; while [...] "Golden Hair" [...] was [...] "great". After the playbacks, Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones: [...] "Opel" [...] and [...] "Clowns and Jugglers" [...] (both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner), and the newly written [...] "Terrapin" [...] and [...] "Love You".|$|E
500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E
500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, AllMusic editor John Bush recommended The Lost Tapes to [...] "hip-hop fans {{who want to}} <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> great rhyming with no added features" [...] and commented that tracks such as [...] "Doo Rags", [...] "No Idea's Original", and [...] "Black Zombie" [...] "stand up to anything Nas has recorded since the original Illmatic." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews commented that the album [...] "proved remarkably consistent throughout, and was a superb listening experience" [...] and considered it a studio release, stating [...] "this was a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider {{this to be the}} closest cousin we will ever get to Illmatic II." [...] Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' [...] "finest moments". About.com's Henry Adaso called it [...] "noteworthy because of its superiority to half the stuff in Nas' catalog." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it [...] "somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se," [...] even though it features [...] "some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed." [...] In its 2007 issue, XXL included The Lost Tapes in its list of [...] "classic" [...] albums to be given the publication's maximum [...] "XXL" [...] rating. In 2012, Complex included The Lost Tapes in their list of [...] "25 Rap Albums From the Past Decade That Deserve Classic Status".|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album is}} among the heavier {{releases}} by Smashing Pumpkins.
