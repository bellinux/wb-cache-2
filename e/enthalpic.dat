5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical <b>enthalpic</b> bonds.|$|E

Ideally, these parameters should account for both <b>enthalpic</b> and entropic contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very coarse-grained models have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.|$|E

PVK elasticity has both entropic and <b>enthalpic</b> origins characterizable by a polymer persistence length and a stretch modulus. At low to moderate extensions PEVK elasticity can be modeled with a standard wormlike chain (WLC) model of entropic elasticity.

2500|$|Each {{quantity}} in {{the equations}} above {{can be divided}} {{by the amount of}} substance, measured in moles, to form molar Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy {{is one of the most}} important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a [...] "dynamic" [...] quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the <b>enthalpic</b> and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accessible}} {{surface area}} (ASA) method {{is based on}} experimental linear relations between Gibbs free energy of transfer and the surface area of a solute molecule. This method operates directly with free energy of solvation, unlike molecular mechanics or electrostatic methods that include only the <b>enthalpic</b> component of free energy. The continuum representation of solvent also significantly improves the computational speed and reduces errors in statistical averaging that arise from incomplete sampling of solvent conformations, so that the energy landscapes obtained with [...] implicit and explicit solvent are different. Although the implicit solvent model is useful for simulations of biomolecules, this is an approximate method with certain limitations and problems related to parameterization and treatment of ionization effects.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{chemical}} reaction, reactants collide {{to form a}} transition state, the <b>enthalpic</b> maximum in a reaction coordinate diagram, which proceeds to the product. [...] Normally, reactants form products of lesser chemical energy. [...] The difference in energy between reactants and products, represented as , is turned into heat, physically realized as excitations in the vibrational state of the normal modes of the product. [...] Since vibrational energy is generally {{much greater than the}} thermal agitation, it rapidly disperses in the solvent through molecular rotation. [...] This is how exothermic reactions make their solutions hotter. [...] In a chemiluminescent reaction, the direct product of the reaction is an excited electronic state. This state then decays into an electronic ground state and emits light through either an allowed transition (analogous to fluorescence) or a forbidden transition (analogous to phosphorescence), depending partly on the spin state of the electronic excited state formed.|$|E
2500|$|Micelles form {{only when}} the {{concentration}} of surfactant {{is greater than the}} critical micelle concentration (CMC), and the temperature of the system is greater than the critical micelle temperature, or Krafft temperature. The formation of micelles can be understood using thermodynamics: Micelles can form spontaneously because of a balance between entropy and enthalpy. In water, the hydrophobic effect is the driving force for micelle formation, despite the fact that assembling surfactant molecules is unfavorable in terms of both enthalpy and entropy of the system. At very low concentrations of the surfactant, only monomers are present in solution. As the concentration of the surfactant is increased, a point is reached at which the unfavorable entropy contribution, from clustering the hydrophobic tails of the molecules, is overcome by a gain in entropy due to release of the solvation shells around the surfactant tails. At this point, the lipid tails of a part of the surfactants must be segregated from the water. Hence, they start to form micelles. In broad terms, above the CMC, the loss of entropy due to assembly of the surfactant molecules is less than the gain in entropy by setting free the water molecules that were [...] "trapped" [...] in the solvation shells of the surfactant monomers. Also important are <b>enthalpic</b> considerations, such as the electrostatic interactions that occur between the charged parts of surfactants.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hydrophobic}} {{effect can}} be quantified by measuring the partition coefficients of non-polar molecules between water and non-polar solvents. The partition coefficients can be transformed to free energy of transfer which includes <b>enthalpic</b> and entropic components, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. These components are experimentally determined by calorimetry. The hydrophobic effect {{was found to be}} entropy-driven at room temperature because of the reduced mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of the non-polar solute; however, the <b>enthalpic</b> component of transfer energy was found to be favorable, meaning it strengthened water-water hydrogen bonds in the solvation shell due to the reduced mobility of water molecules. At the higher temperature, when water molecules become more mobile, this energy gain decreases along with the entropic component. The hydrophobic effect depends on the temperature, which leads to [...] "cold denaturation" [...] of proteins.|$|E
