40|$|RATIONALE: Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{has been}} demonstrated to be accurate in diagnosing <b>valvular</b> <b>lesions</b> in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) when compared to clinical evaluation alone. OBJECTIVE: To perform Doppler echocardiography in children clinically diagnosed by the Jones criteria to have acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and to then compare the effectiveness of echo in detecting single/multi-valvular lesions {{with that of the}} initial clinical evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 93 children who were previously diagnosed with ARF by clinical examination. Presence of <b>valvular</b> <b>lesions</b> were enlisted, first by clinical auscultation, and then by performing Doppler echocardiography. We found that Doppler echocardiography was a sensitive technique, capable of detecting <b>valvular</b> <b>lesions</b> that were missed by clinical auscultation alone. Echocardiography of patients with carditis revealed mitral regurgitation to be the most common lesion present (53 patients, 56. 98 %), followed by aortic regurgitation in 21 patients (22. 6 %). The difference between clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis in ARF children with carditis was statistically significant for mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. Clinical auscultation alone revealed 4 cases of mitral stenosis, 39 mitral regurgitation, 14 aortic regurgitation, 9 tricuspid regurgitation; in contrast, echo revealed 5 cases of mitral stenosis, 53 mitral regurgitation, 21 aortic regurgitation, 18 tricuspid regurgitation. CONCLUSION: Doppler echocardiography is a more sensitive technique for detecting <b>valvular</b> <b>lesions.</b> In the setting of ARF, echo enables a 46. 9 % higher detection level of carditis, as compared to the clinical examination alone. Echo was very significant in detecting regurgitation lesions, especially for cases of tricuspid regurgitation in the setting of multivalvular involvement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{middle income}} countries, {{the burden of}} rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains high, but the {{prevalence}} of other heart valve diseases may rise as the population life expectancy increases. Here, we compared population-based data on surgical procedures to assess {{the relative importance of}} causes of heart valve disease in Salvador, Brazil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Medical charts of patients who underwent surgery for valvular heart disease from January 2002 -December 2005 were reviewed. Incidence of surgery for valvular heart disease was calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with in-hospital death following surgery. The most common etiologies for valvular dysfunction in 491 valvular heart surgery patients were RHD (60. 3 %), degenerative valve disease (15. 3 %), and endocarditis (4. 5 %). Mean annual incidence for surgeries due to any valvular heart diseases, RHD, and <b>degenerative</b> <b>valvular</b> disease were 5. 02, 3. 03, and 0. 77 per 100, 000 population, respectively. Incidence of surgery due to RHD was highest in young adults; procedures were predominantly paid by the public health sector. In contrast, the incidence of surgery due to <b>degenerative</b> <b>valvular</b> disease was highest among those older than 60 years of age; procedures were mostly paid by the private sector. The overall in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 11. 9 %. Independent factors associated with death included increase in age (odds ratio: 1. 04 per year of age; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 02 - 1. 06), endocarditis (6. 35; 1. 92 - 21. 04), multiple valve operative procedures (4. 35; 2. 12 - 8. 95), and prior heart valve surgery (2. 49; 1. 05 - 5. 87). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: RHD remains the main cause for valvular heart surgery in Salvador, which primarily affects young adults without private health insurance. In contrast, surgery due to <b>degenerative</b> <b>valvular</b> disease primarily impacts the elderly with private health insurance. Strategies to reduce the burden of valvular heart disease will need to address the disparate factors that contribute to RHD as well as degenerative valve disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Rheumatic fever (RF) is an {{autoimmune}} disease triggered by Streptococcus pyogenes infection frequently observed in infants from developing countries. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), the major sequel of RF, leads to chronic {{inflammation of the}} myocardium and valvular tissue. T cells are the main population infiltrating cardiac lesions; however, the chemokines that orchestrate their recruitment are not clearly defined. Here, we investigated the expression of chemokines and che-mokine receptors in cardiac tissue biopsies obtained from chronic RHD patients. Our results showed that CCL 3 /MIP 1 α gene expression was upregulated in myocardium while CCL 1 /I- 309 and CXCL 9 / Mig were highly expressed in valvular tissue. Auto-reactive T cells that infiltrate <b>valvular</b> <b>lesions</b> presented a memory phenotype (CD 4 +CD 45 RO+) and migrate mainly toward CXCL 9 /Mig gradient.

The clinical manifestations of primary antiphospholipid syndrome were arterial thrombosis in 14 patients, venous thrombosis in 6 and recurrent fetal loss in 14. <b>Valvular</b> <b>lesions</b> were observed on two-dimensional echocardiography in 11 patients (32 %) (9 women and 2 men), aged 24 to 57 years (mean ± 1 SD 36 ± 10). Abnormal echocardiographic findings were observed in 9 (64 %) of 14 patients with arterial thrombosis versus 1 (17 %) of 6 patients with venous thrombosis and 1 (7 %) of 14 patients with recurrent fetal loss. The most common echocardiographic abnormality was mitral leaflet thickening, found in five patients; this was associated with mitral regurgitation in three and with combined mild mitral stenosis and regurgitation in one patient.
