5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "center of mass" [...] {{in the form}} of the center of gravity was first {{introduced}} by the ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point—their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of long shore current {{before and}} after {{permeable}} groin structure installation is difficult especially in hydraulic model of small water depth. The problems arise that no instrument is dedicated to measure such current at very small depth and long shore current varies quite significantly from the location of breaking wave to the maximum run up position. Measuring instruments {{that can be used}} to measure the long shore currents on a laboratory scale is very limited. Measurement of long shore current using <b>floating</b> <b>objects</b> is a method to overcome the limitations of measuring instruments of longs shore current. <b>Floating</b> <b>objects</b> arranged width surf zone and then was dropped by observing the position of the wave. Then the movement of <b>floating</b> <b>objects</b> was recorded by using a video camera. The magnitude of long shore current velocity obtained from the observation of movement distance of <b>floating</b> <b>objects</b> per time unit. The results of measurements of long shore current by <b>floating</b> <b>objects</b> was verified by the results of calculations using the equations of long shore current (equation Longuet-Higgins, 1970). Verification of the measurement results with the results of calculations indicate relatively similar results, so the <b>floating</b> <b>objects</b> method can be recommended for the measurement of long shore current...|$|R

60|$|Any {{object that}} comes between {{the sun and}} these ripples, takes from them the power of {{reflecting}} the sun, and in consequence, all their light; hence any intervening objects cast apparent shadows upon such spaces of intense force, and of the exact shape, and in the exact place of real shadows, and yet which are no more real shadows than the withdrawal of {{an image of a}} piece of white paper from a mirror is a shadow on the mirror. Farther, in all shallow water, more or less in proportion to its shallowness, but in some measure, I suppose, up to depths of forty or fifty fathoms, and perhaps more, the local color of the water depends in great measure on light reflected from the bottom. This, however, is especially manifest in clear rivers like the Rhone, where the absence of the light reflected from below forms an apparent shadow, often visibly detached some distance from the <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> which casts it.|$|E

With a grunt of disgust he was about to push it from him when the white garment enshrouding it suggested a bold plan to his resourceful brain. Grasping the corpse by an arm he tore the garment from it and then let the body float downward toward the temple. With great care he draped the robe about him; the bloody blotch that had covered the severed neck he arranged about his own head. His haversack he rolled as tightly as possible and stuffed beneath his coat over his breast. Then he fell gently to the surface of the stream and lying upon his back floated downward with the current and out into the open sunlight.|$|E
60|$|Our mate {{heard his}} own heart beat, as he became {{satisfied}} of the actual condition of the wreck, and of the physical certainty that existed of its sinking, {{at least to the}} point last mentioned, ere the sun came to throw his glories over the last view that the sufferers would be permitted to take of the face of day. It appeared to him that no time was to be lost. There lay the dim and shapeless object that seemed to be the boat, distant, as he thought, about a mile. It would not have been visible at all but for the perfect smoothness of the sea, and the low position occupied by the observer. At times it did disappear altogether, when it would rise again, as if undulating in the ground-swell. This last circumstance, more than any other, persuaded Harry {{that it was not a}} rock, but some <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> that he beheld. Thus encouraged, he delayed no longer. Every moment was precious, and all might be lost by indecision. He did not like the appearance of deserting his companions, but, should he fail, the motive would appear in the act.

60|$|Olfactory Organs.--In {{the outer}} maxillæ, at their bases where united together, but above the basal fold {{separating}} the mouth from the body, there are, {{in all the}} genera, a pair of orifices (Pl. X, fig. 16); these are sometimes seated on a slight prominence, as in Lithotrya, or on the summit of flattened tubes (Pl. X, fig. 17), projecting upwards and towards each other, as in Ibla, Scalpellum, and Pollicipes. In Ibla these tubular projections rise from almost between the outer and inner maxillæ. It is impossible to behold these organs, and doubt that they are of high functional importance to the animal. The orifice leads into a deep sack lined by pulpy corium, and closed at the bottom. The outer integument is inflected inwards, (hence periodically moulted,) and becoming of excessive tenuity, runs to {{near the bottom of}} the sack, where it ends in an open tube: so excessively thin is this inflected membrane, that, until examining Anelasma, I was not quite certain that I was right in believing that the outer integument did not extend over the whole bottom. I several times saw a nerve of considerable size entering and blending into a pulpy layer at the bottom of the sack of corium; but I failed in tracing to which of the three pair of nerves, springing from the front end of the infra-oesophageal ganglion, it joined. I can hardly avoid concluding, that this closed sack, with its naked bottom, is an organ of sense; and, considering that the outer maxillæ serve to carry the prey entangled by the cirri towards the maxillæ and mandibles, the position seems so admirably adapted for an olfactory organ, whereby the animal could at once perceive the nature of any <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> thus caught, that I have ventured provisionally to designate the two orifices and sacks as olfactory.|$|E

6000|$|One {{effect of}} this revelation {{of the nature of}} ocean to him was not a little singular. It seemed that ever {{afterwards}} his appreciation of the calmness of water was deepened by what he had witnessed of its frenzy, and a certain class of entirely tame subjects were treated by him even with increased affection after he had seen the full manifestation of sublimity. He had always a great regard for canal boats, and instead of sacrificing these old, and one would have thought unentertaining, friends to the deities of Storm, he seems to have returned with a lulling pleasure from the foam and danger of the beach to the sedgy bank and stealthy barge of the lowland river. Thenceforward his work which introduces shipping is divided into two classes; one embodying the poetry of silence and calmness, the other of turbulence and wrath. Of intermediate conditions he gives few examples; if he lets the wind down upon the sea at all, it is nearly always violent, and though the waves may not be running high, the foam is torn off them in a way which shows they will soon run higher. On the other hand, nothing is so perfectly calm as Turner's calmness. To the canal barges of England he soon added other types of languid motion; the broad-ruddered barks of the Loire, the drooping sails of Seine, the arcaded barks of the Italian lakes slumbering on expanse of mountain-guarded wave, the dreamy prows of pausing gondolas on lagoons at moon-rise; in each and all commanding an intensity of calm, chiefly because he never admitted an instant's rigidity. The surface of quiet water with other painters becomes FIXED. With Turner it looks as if a fairy's breath would stir it, but the fairy's breath is not there. So also his boats are intensely motionless, because intensely capable of motion. No other painter ever floated a boat quite rightly; all other boats stand on the water, or are fastened in it; only his float in it. It is very difficult to trace the reasons of this, for the rightness of the placing on the water depends on such subtle curves and shadows in the <b>floating</b> <b>object</b> and its reflection, that in most cases the question of entirely right or entirely wrong resolves itself into the [...] "estimation of an hair": and what makes the matter more difficult still, is, that sometimes we may see a boat drawn with the most studied correctness in every part, which yet will not swim; and sometimes we may find one drawn with many easily ascertainable errors, which yet swims well enough; so that the drawing of boats is something like the building of them, one may set off their lines by the most authentic rules, and yet never be sure they will sail well. It is, however, to be observed that Turner seemed, in those southern coast storms, to have been somewhat too strongly impressed by the disappearance of smaller crafts in surf, and was wont afterwards to give an uncomfortable aspect even to his gentlest seas, by burying his boats too deeply. When he erred, in this or other matters, it was not from want of pains, for of all accessories to landscape, ships were throughout his life those which he studied with the greatest care. His figures, whatever their merit or demerit, are certainly never the beloved part of his work; and though the architecture was in his early drawings careful, and continued to be so down to the Hakewell's Italy series, it soon became mannered and false whenever it was principal. He would indeed draw a ruined tower, or a distant town, incomparably better than any one else, and a staircase or a bit of balustrade very carefully; but his temples and cathedrals showed great ignorance of detail, and want of understanding of their character. But I am aware of no painting from the beginning of his life to its close, containing modern shipping as its principal subject, in which he did not put forth his full strength, and pour out his knowledge of detail with a joy which renders those works, as a series, among the most valuable he ever produced.
