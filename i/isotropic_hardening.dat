40|$|Constitutive {{plasticity}} {{theory is}} commonly {{applied to the}} numerical analysis of welds {{in one of three}} ways: using an <b>isotropic</b> <b>hardening</b> model, a kinematic hardening model, or a mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening model. The choice of model is not entirely dependent on its numerical accuracy, however, as a lack of empirical data will often necessitate the use of a specific approach. The present paper seeks to identify the accuracy of each formalism through direct comparison of the predicted and actual post-weld residual stress field developed in a three-pass 316 LN stainless steel slot weldment. From these comparisons, it is clear that while the <b>isotropic</b> <b>hardening</b> model tends to noticeably over-predict and the kinematic hardening model slightly under-predict the residual post-weld stress field, the results using a mixed hardening model are quantitatively accurate. Even though the kinematic hardening model generally provides more accurate results when compared to an <b>isotropic</b> <b>hardening</b> formalism, the latter might be a more appealing choice to engineers requiring a conservative design regarding weld residual stress. © 2014, Trans Tech Publications...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to study the anisotropic material behavior during forming processes, represented by both complex yield loci and kinematic-isotropic hardening models. A first part of this paper describes the main concepts of the ‘Stress-strain interpolation’ model that has been implemented in the non-linear finite element code Lagamine. This model consists of a local description of the yield locus based on the texture of the material through the full constraints Taylor’s model. The texture evolution due to plastic deformations is computed throughout the FEM simulations. This ‘local yield locus’ approach was initially linked to the classical <b>isotropic</b> Swift <b>hardening</b> law.
