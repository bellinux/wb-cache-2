5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} author, however, {{the idea of}} Hudal's {{intervention}} came from the German ambassador himself, who asked the rector of the Anima to sign {{a letter to the}} military commander of Rome, General Reiner Stahel, requesting that the arrests be halted, otherwise the pope would take a position in public against the arrests and the German occupiers. Ambassador Weizsäcker argued that he had chosen this ruse because Hitler might <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> against the Vatican and the Pope if it had been the German embassy conveying the warning, instead of the Nazi-friendly bishop. During the war Hudal sheltered victims of the Nazis at Santa Maria dell'Anima, used by the Resistance.

25|$|Anthocyanins {{have the}} ability to change into three {{different}} forms—colorless, red and blue—depending on the pH/acidity levels of the solution they are in. At wine pH (typically 2.9-4.0), most of the grape anythocyanins are in the colorless form unless they <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> with tannins or other molecules (such as tannins also extracted from the skin as well as grape seeds, stems and from oak wine barrels) to form a stabilized pigment. So producers wishing to make rosé work to not only limit the amount of anthocyanins extracted into the wine but also limit the wines exposure to tannins (either by less maceration time, gentle pressing of the grapes or use only stainless tanks instead of oak) as well as protective anti-oxidative winemaking techniques that limit the development of acetaldehyde and other browning pigments that could add color to the wine.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted {{the course of}} evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds. The {{presence of}} banded-iron formations (BIFs) have been interpreted as a clue for the rise of oxygen since small amounts of oxygen could <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> with reduced ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in the oceans, resulting in the deposition of sediments containing Fe(III) oxide in places like Western Australia. However, any oxidizing environment, including that provided by microbes such as the iron-oxidizing photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can trigger iron oxide formation and thus BIF deposition. Other mechanisms include oxidation by UV light. Indeed, BIFs occur across large swaths of Earth’s history and may not correlate with only one event.|$|E

25|$|Potassium bromide is not {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans to control seizures. In Germany, it is still approved as an antiepileptic drug for humans, particularly children and adolescents. These indications include severe forms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, early-childhood-related Grand-Mal-seizures, and also severe myoclonic seizures during childhood. Adults who <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> positively to the drug during childhood/adolescence may continue treatment. Potassium bromide tablets are sold under the brand name Dibro-Be mono (Rx-only). The drug has almost complete bioavailability, but the bromide ion has a relatively long half life of 12 days in the blood, making bromide salts difficult to adjust and dose. Bromide is not known {{to interfere with the}} absorption or excretion of any other anticonvulsant, though it does have strong interactions with chloride in the body, the normal body uptake and excretion of which strongly influences bromide's excretion.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, China and Mongolia {{signed a}} treaty wherein both promised to respect each other's {{territorial}} integrity. In the same year, the Inner Mongolia Communist Party explicitly repudiated the Greater Mongolia idea, citing {{the threat to}} China's unity and the likely dominance of Mongolia in such a union. Because {{of the existence of}} an independent Mongolian state, Inner Mongols have generally not aspired to an independent state of their own, and what little separatist sentiment in Inner Mongolia aspires to union with independent Mongolia. The feelings are not reciprocated, as the history and geography of China are not taught in Mongolian schools, and knowledge of the Inner Mongols in Mongolia is low.Similarly to the Inner Mongolian government, high-ranking Buryat officials <b>have</b> <b>reacted</b> to the Greater Mongolia idea by rejecting that Buryats are Mongols at all. Since the normalization of Sino-Mongolian relations in 1994, the Mongolian government does not support Greater Mongolian nationalism, but it tolerates organizations in Mongolia which do, such as the Mongolian newspaper Il Tovchuu. In 2002, the Republic of China (Taiwan) recognized Mongolia's independence, and established informal relations with Mongolia. Various small organizations in Mongolia advocate a Greater Mongolia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The oil/water {{interfacial}} {{properties and}} {{the stability of}} the emulsion of ASP flooding in Daqing Oilfield were investigated with the measurement of interfacial tension, interfacial shear viscosity，Zeta potential and turbidity of the oil/water system. The results show that, after NaOH <b>has</b> <b>reacted</b> with Daqing crude oil for a long time, the interfacial tension between the aqueous phase and Daqing model oil decreases. The absolute value of the Zeta potential of the surface of oil droplets increases. The changes of the interfacial shear viscosity between the aqueous phase and the oil phase {{do not appear to be}} obvious. The stability of O/W emulsion formed by Daqing model oil and the aqueous phase is enhanced. After NaOH <b>has</b> <b>reacted</b> with crude oil for 1 d, the interfacial tension between oil phase and simulated water, Zeta potential and {{the stability of the}} oil/water emulsion become higher than that of the emulsion without NaOH. However, after NaOH <b>has</b> <b>reacted</b> with crude oil for 10 d and 30 d, respectively, the interfacial tension between oil phase and simulated water, Zeta potential and the stability of the O/W emulsion are lower than that of the emulsion with the same reaction for 1 d...|$|R
