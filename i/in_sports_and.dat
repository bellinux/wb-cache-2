40|$|<b>Sport</b> <b>and</b> {{recreation}} {{are highly}} valued in New Zealand. Individuals and communities invest considerable {{amounts of time}} <b>and</b> money <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation. A number of government agencies invest <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation and local councils invest billions of dollars <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation facilities. Community clubs and private businesses complement these public facilities by providing their own goods and services to New Zealanders engaged <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation. Given this high level {{of public and private}} investment, {{it is important to understand}} the benefits (minus any costs) resulting from participation <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation. Consequently, SPARC commissioned Professor Paul Dalziel to prepare a comprehensive framework to value the benefits of <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation for New Zealand as a whole and for thirteen regions. This report presents the results for Bay of Plenty region. It begins by summarising what is known about participation <b>and</b> volunteering <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation <b>in</b> the region. The rest of this section explains in more detail the reasons for valuing <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation, how the <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> recreation sector is defined for this work, how the contribution to regional gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated, and the content of the report...|$|R

5|$|Eichmann {{attended}} the Kaiser Franz Joseph Staatsoberrealschule (state secondary school) in Linz, {{the same high}} school Adolf Hitler had attended some 17 years before. He played the violin and participated <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> clubs, including a Wandervogel woodcraft and scouting group that included some older boys {{who were members of}} various right-wing militias. His poor school performance resulted in his father withdrawing him from the Realschule and enrolling him in the Höhere Bundeslehranstalt für Elektrotechnik, Maschinenbau und Hochbau vocational college. He left without attaining a degree and joined his father's new enterprise, the Untersberg Mining Company, where he worked for several months. From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the Oberösterreichische Elektrobau AG radio company. Next, between 1927 and early 1933, Eichmann worked in Upper Austria and Salzburg as district agent for the Vacuum Oil Company AG.|$|E

In early 1936 he attended a National Socialism course in Lauenburg, Pomerania. He completed his compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst) in October 1936 with Abteilung (department) 5/50 in Lüttmannshagen, district of Cammin. As an athlete, he especially excelled in the decathlon; almost daily he practised the ten different disciplines. Aged 17, he attended a summer camp held in conjunction with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism <b>in</b> <b>Sports</b> <b>and</b> Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games, when only men were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> to applaud a man's effort.|$|E
5|$|The film spawned {{critical}} commentary in a {{broad spectrum}} of media outlets which include leading newspapers such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post; leading periodicals such as Forbes; online forums such as Slate; and leading news outlets such as MSNBC. In particular, the film sparked a verbal war between Jalen Rose and Duke University's Grant Hill through the media regarding issues of race <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> education that fueled the Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry. Coincidentally, the following week, the 2011 editions of Michigan and Duke met in the third round of the 2011 NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Tournament; Duke won, 73-71.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E

5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women <b>in</b> <b>Sports,</b> <b>and</b> attended meetings of several associations and business groups while taking the time to be with her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|E
5|$|From the start, it was {{considered}} socially appropriate for women to play netball; netball's restricted movement appealed to contemporary notions of women's participation <b>in</b> <b>sports,</b> <b>and</b> the sport was distinct from potential rival male sports. Netball became a popular women's sport in countries where it was introduced and spread rapidly through school systems. School leagues and domestic competitions emerged {{during the first half}} of the 20th century, and in 1924 the first national governing body was established in New Zealand. International competition was initially hampered by a lack of funds and varying rules in different countries. Australia hosted New Zealand in the first international game of netball in Melbourne on 20 August 1938; Australia won 40–11. Efforts began in 1957 to standardise netball rules globally: by 1960 international playing rules had been standardised, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball, later the International Netball Federation (INF), was formed to administer the sport worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested <b>in</b> <b>sports,</b> <b>and</b> concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E
