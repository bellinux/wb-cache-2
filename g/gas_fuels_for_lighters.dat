This paper concludes with an economic discussion regarding Javon's paradox and the fungibility of natural gas as compared to that of oil. In order to determine if natural gas can replace diesel for the country's heavy duty truck transportation needs, the energy equivalent and efficiency of natural gas alternatives should be compared to diesel.

30|$|Figure  8 further {{shows that}} natural gas storage {{facility}} is used more frequently under the worst case, {{in response to}} frequent hourly dispatch changes of gas-fired unit and PtG facility as shown in Fig.  7. Because operating natural gas storage facility incurs costs, it is rarely used in the base case unless operational economics can be improved. Specifically, in hours 5 – 6 of the base case when wind generation is high, natural gas produced by the PtG facility cannot be transported to gas loads due to natural gas network congestion caused by gas nodal pressure limits, and in turn {{a certain amount of}} natural gas is stored on site in the storage facility and used later at hour 7. On the other hand, in the worst case, more natural gas is injected into and withdrawn out of the storage facility to provide enough <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>for</b> supporting ramping and generating capabilities of the gas-fired unit when electrical load is high. In addition, in hours 21 – 23, natural gas is injected into gas storage facilities to secure <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> supply to gas-fired units in the next operation day.|$|R

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} dynamical {{evolution of}} a merger between a central massive black hole (MBH) and a gas clump with the mass of 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 M_ in the central tens pc of a galactic bulge. We found that strong tidal gravitational field of the MBH transforms the initial spherical clump into a moderately thick gaseous disk (or torus) around the MBH. The developed disk is also found to show rotation, essentially because the tidal field changes efficiently the orbital angular momentum of the clump into intrinsic angular momentum of the disk. Furthermore about a few percent of gas mass (corresponding to a few 10 ^ 5 M_) in the clump {{is found to be}} transferred to the central sub-parsec region around the MBH within an order of 10 ^ 6 yr.
