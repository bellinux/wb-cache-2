40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of three major forms of peat processing by the manufacturing industry in The Netherlands since {{the last quarter of}} the 19 th century. At a time when peat as a fuel was gradually being replaced by coal, the first form was the peat moss litter industry. Peat moss litter was made from white peat that was ground and sieved in factories which were located mainly in bog areas in the south-east of the province of Drenthe. It served as excellent bedding for horses and cattle. The second form of industrial peat processing was the manufacture, from 1921 onwards, of active carbon made from black peat. The Purit (Norit) factory, now part of the Cabot Corporation, is still the only active carbon factory using peat as a raw material. The third form of peat processing was the production of <b>garden</b> <b>peat</b> and potting soil. This is still a widespread activity in peat areas all over the world. The peat moss litter industry thrived from the 1880 s until shortly after the First World War. The arrival of the horse-drawn tram in all of the major cities of Europe created a great demand for animal bedding to be used in the vast stables of the tramway companies. Peat moss litter was cleaner, healthier and easier to handle than straw. There was similar demand from the armies, which used millions of horses during the First World War. Owing to the development of motorised vehicles, the peat market collapsed after the war and this plunged the industry into a prolonged crisis which was not overcome until peat was found to be a suitable growing medium for horticulture in the 1950 s. Living and working conditions in peatlands were harsh, earnings irregular and labourers’ rights limited. The peat manufacturing industry was the first to introduce collective labour agreements, medical benefits and pension plans. Nonetheless massive unemployment, poverty and the necessity to migrate to other parts of the country were clear signs that the era of peat was over for all but a handful of labourers...|$|E

The headquarters building is located on a 3 acre site on Mount Scio Road. The main garden area includes a greenhouse (including one on the former Squires property across the street which is now a Heritage Site), an alpine house featuring high latitude plants, rock <b>gardens,</b> <b>peat</b> <b>gardens,</b> a heritage garden and a koi pond. The garden is also a nature reserve, featuring 3.5 km of trails in the surrounding boreal forest. Moose, snowshoe hare, ruffed grouse and other wildlife are frequently observed inside the park boundaries.|$|R

The main objective of this study is approximate if Hedera helix L. could have a rooted system develop on eroded slope, without other vegetative incomes. Other objectives are to assess how substrate influences the development of root system. The independent variants are three types of substrate: <b>peat,</b> <b>garden</b> soil and a mixture of <b>peat</b> and <b>garden</b> soil in a ratio of 1 : 1, and all the three of them had the drainage layer being formed from one centimeter of sand...|$|R
40|$|Our paper {{deals with}} the wise use of peat and {{substrates}} in France, from a horticultural point of view. Modern horticultural substrates {{have been used for}} many years now to grow potted plants, nursery plants in containers, bedding plants, cut flowers and vegetables. The substrate market is considerable at this time, at both the professional and home <b>gardening</b> level. <b>Peat</b> and peat mixtures represent the biggest part of substrates. However, France is not self-sufficient in terms of horticultural peat production. As a result, different products exist as an alternative to peat: composted bark, coir and wood fibres, green waste, expanded materials, mineral wool, etc. This paper discusses some major strategies concerning substrates, taking current trends in citizens' needs in modern society into account, including the social demand for an ecological approach towards a more environmentally-friendly agriculture, combined with effective technical and economic performance. Peat and peatland preservation as well as the contribution of horticulture to the ecological re-use of solid waste must be dealt with within the framework of horticultural substrates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Controlling erosion in shady {{places is}} among the most serious {{problems}} of environment protection, one that requires persistent and strenuous efforts. Ivy (Hedera helix L.) is exceptionally shade-tolerant, covers the ground surface nicely, and is easy to cultivate. For these reasons, it can be used more successfully than any other ground cover to control erosion in shady places. Hardening of ivy cuttings is accomplished with semi-lignified and lignified cuttings. In hardening of cuttings in plastic containers, a substrate composed of <b>garden</b> soil and <b>peat</b> proved to be the most effective. Even when the percentage of ivy cuttings that take is low in shady places subject to erosion, the significance of their presence is great in subsequent years, when the ivy spreads over the ground, covering it and retarding erosion of the soil...|$|R
40|$|Small {{freshwater}} ponds host diverse and vulnerable biotic assemblages but relatively few conspicuous, specially protected taxa. In Europe, the amphibians Triturus cristatus and Pelobates fuscus are among a few species whose populations {{have been successfully}} restored using pond restoration and management activities at the landscape scale. In this study, we explored whether the ponds constructed for those two target species have wider conservation significance, particularly for other species of conservation concern. We recorded the occurrence of amphibians and selected aquatic macro-invertebrates (dragonflies; damselflies; diving beetles; water scavenger beetles) in 66 ponds specially constructed for amphibians (up to 8 years post construction) and, for comparison, in 100 man-made ponds (created by local people for cattle or <b>garden</b> watering, <b>peat</b> excavation, etc.) and 65 natural ponds in Estonia. We analysed nestedness of the species assemblages and its dependence on the environment, and described the co-occurrence patterns between the target amphibians and other aquatic species. The assemblages in all ponds were significantly nested, but the environmental determinants of nestedness and co-occurrence of particular species differed among pond types. Constructed ponds were most species-rich irrespective {{of the presence of}} the target species; however, T. cristatus was frequent in those ponds and rare elsewhere, and it showed nested patterns in every type of pond. We thus conclude that pond construction for the protected amphibians can serve broader habitat conservation aims in the short term. However, the heterogeneity and inconsistent presence of species of conservation concern observed in other types of ponds implies that long-term perspectives on pond management require more explicit consideration of different habitat and biodiversity values. We also highlight nestedness analysis as a tool {{that can be used for}} the practical task of selecting focal species for habitat conservation...|$|R
40|$|Using our Well-being Questionnaires and {{stakeholder}} interviews we {{have established}} {{the impact of}} the PEaT project on beneficiaries. Participating in the <b>PEaT</b> <b>garden</b> leads to improvements in beneficiary’ sense of well-being, reduction in social isolation, reduction in depression and anxiety, helps certain beneficiaries to recover from addiction issues, improves self-esteem, enhances physical health and provides a space where beneficiaries can experience recovery. There was a statistically significant increase in beneficiary connectedness on the Friendship Scale scores from baseline (M= 17. 03, SD= 5. 45) to follow-up (M= 18. 65, SD= 4. 93), t (69) = 3. 04, p= < 0. 001. What we find when looking at the raw data is over half of the beneficiaries show significant improvement on the Friendship Scale. On each of the Office for National Statistics well-being indicators PEaT beneficiaries report improvement in their well-being to the extent that average well-being scores improve from a low base and are now higher than the English average. On the satisfaction and life is worthwhile indicators beneficiary scores are now higher than the region and county averages. On three of the four ONS indicators these improvements are statistically significant (p= 0. 0001). Average PEaT attendance by beneficiaries were 12 sessions over a 12 month period averaging a total of 44 hours/beneficiary. Attendance compares favourably with alternative therapies available to local people living with anxiety and depression disorders e. g. : Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). With locally commissioned IAPT services typically people with mild to moderate depression might receive between six and 10 - sessions over eight to 12 weeks. Analysis suggests the cost per of attending a local Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) session per patient is £ 102. 38 for low intensity therapy, and £ 173. 88 for high intensity therapy (Griffiths et. al. 2014). If all 108 PEaT beneficiaries were to be given 12 sessions of low intensity IAPT the actual cost would be £ 132, 684; i. e. 15...|$|R
