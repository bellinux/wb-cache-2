5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of its <b>food</b> <b>from</b> fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} mutually beneficial relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|Helen Whittier had {{returned}} to intercoastal service by early 1934 when The New York Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April. In June that same year, Helen Whittier {{was one of the}} Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles to Honolulu.|$|E
40|$|<b>Foods</b> <b>from</b> {{outbreaks}} of <b>food</b> poisoning were examined {{for the presence}} of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) by a sandwich ELISA using microtitre trays as the solid phase and SEA antibodies raised in sheep. The presence of SEA was confirmed by neutralization tests. The toxin was detected in 12 of 15 <b>foods</b> <b>from</b> separate {{outbreaks of}} staphylococcal food poisoning; all 15 foods contained a strain of Staphylococcus aureus which produced SEA. For most foods a simple extraction procedure without a concentration step was sufficient to detect the toxin. The method was semi-quantitative and recoveries of SEA added to control <b>foods</b> varied <b>from</b> 30 to 80 %. The <b>foods</b> <b>from</b> outbreaks contained between 1 and 10 micrograms of SEA/ 100 g. SEA was not found in <b>foods</b> <b>from</b> 21 outbreaks in which an SEA-producing strain of Staph. aureus was not isolated...|$|R

5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for <b>food</b> <b>from</b> a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs <b>food</b> <b>from</b> the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals <b>food</b> <b>from</b> bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} <b>food</b> <b>from</b> predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. Males have also been found to pirate <b>food</b> <b>from</b> unmated females and juveniles during {{the breeding}} season.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable <b>food</b> <b>from</b> spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge <b>food</b> <b>from</b> litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E

5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of <b>food</b> <b>from</b> the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E

5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract <b>food</b> <b>from</b> these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
