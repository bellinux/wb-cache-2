The <b>dimmer</b> <b>board,</b> now {{referred to as the}} lighting console, especially with newer digital control systems like DMX, uses a serial data stream to control multiple groups called [...] "universes" [...] of 512 DMX addresses to control compatible fixtures including dimmers, via different methods leading to a single twisted pair of wires connected to the fixtures. DMX consoles are largely computerized, thus allowing digital process control from multiple input devices, and synchronization via MIDI, SMPTE etc.|$|E

In this work, we report further experiments that support the identification of this particle. We use aerogel as a comet analog material to characterise the properties of this particle. Our experiments show that this particle has a radius of 0. 9 mm, a low density of 0. 25 g/cm 3 and a high porosity close to 90...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the firm's founding, {{electric}} lighting for the stage was in its infancy. Held finds no catalog of stage lighting equipment earlier than Kliegl's catalog of 1898. as cited in Rubin. Indeed, it may be inferred that the use of [...] "Electric" [...] in the company's name was intended to distinguish its products from the illuminating gas or acetylene fueled equipment they would replace. Many of what became common devices, such as the stage [...] "shoe" [...] or thrust plug and the disappearing footlight were patented by the Kliegls, and many others were developed into the forms still familiar todayInitially they continued the Myerhofer business as [...] "contractors and manufacturers", as noted in their Catalog G of 1913. In 1903 they furnished and installed the complete stage lighting system for the Metropolitan Opera Company's new home on West 37th Street (John was at the time an electrician for the Met). In 1933 they would be again called to provide a complete new stage lighting system, although not as installers. Catalog G also displayed the carbon arc floodlight, developed by the firm in 1911, as the iconic Klieglight. A diverse assortment of lighting and electrical products were also cataloged, such as exit signs, backup batteries, <b>dimmer</b> <b>boards,</b> connectors, effect projectors, chandeliers, marquee lights (and complete marquees), charging outlets for electric cars, switchboards, etc. Featured was a [...] "Skyrocket" [...] sign for Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.The development of electrical standards was spurred, in part, by the Iroquois Theatre fire of 1903. Kliegl Brothers' Catalog E states that [...] "plugs and receptacles are in accordance with Underwriter's requirements and pass city inspections". The Kliegls maintained a direct interest in the development of standards for theatre electrical systems. From 1950 to his death, Herbert Kliegl {{was a member of the}} National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code making panel No. 115.A precursor of today's spotlights, the [...] "baby spotlight", their first using an incandescent lamp, was introduced in their Catalog E of 1906 as cited in Rubin [...] The takeover of the incandescent lamp would be inexorable. as cited in Rubin [...] From about 1908, motion picture studios were using the company's floor-stand arc lamps, which allowed for point-source lighting, including some of the first low-light effects; the shadow produced by the two pairs of carbon rods can be seen in some early films.In their 1922 catalog, the company was still featuring its motion picture studio equipment, but by 1926, references to motion picture applications had dwindled to a single line of type on the first page. In 1924 they introduced the use of glass rondels as color media in border and footlights, eliminating coloring of individual lamps.Kliegl Brothers introduced its Fresnel lens spots in 1929, and by 1935 were ordering their own Fresnel lenses from Corning. as cited in Rubin ...|$|R
40|$|The Philae lander {{carries the}} Dust Impact Monitor (<b>DIM)</b> on <b>board,</b> {{which is part}} of the Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME). DIM employs {{piezoelectric}} PZT sensors to detect impacts by sub-millimeter and millimeter-sized ice and dust particles that are emitted from the nucleus and transported into the cometary coma. The sensor measures dynamical data like flux and the directionality of the impacting particles. Mass and speed of the grains can be constrained for assumed density and the elastic modulus of the grains. DIM was operated during Philae's descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia and detected one particle impact at an altitude of approximately 2. 4 km from the nucleus surface. This is the closest ever dust detection at a cometary nucleus by a dedicated in-situ dust detector. Laboratory calibration experiments performed with compact and porous cometary analogue materials showed that the detected particle had a low bulk density of approximately 250 kg m ^- 3, and a radius of about 1 mm. The measured parameters can be understood in the context of a simple gas flow model. At Philae's �nal landing site, Abydos, DIM detected no dust impact which may be due to low cometary activity in the vicinity of Philae, or due to shading by obstacles close to Philae, or both...|$|R
40|$|Context. The Rosetta lander Philae {{successfully}} {{landed on}} the nucleus of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014. Philae carries the Dust Impact Monitor (<b>DIM)</b> on <b>board,</b> {{which is part of}} the Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME). DIM employs piezoelectric PZT sensors to detect impacts by submillimeter- and millimeter-sized ice and dust particles that are emitted from the nucleus and transported into the cometary coma. Aims. The DIM sensor measures dynamical data such as flux and the directionality of the impacting particles. Mass and speed of the particles can be constrained assuming density and elastic particle properties. Methods. DIM was operated during three mission phases of Philae at the comet: (1) Before the separation of Philae from Rosetta at distances of about 9. 6 km, 11. 8 km, and 25. 3 km from the nucleus barycenter. In this mission phase particles released from the nucleus on radial trajectories remained undetectable because of significant obscuration by the structures of Rosetta, and no dust particles were indeed detected; (2) during Philae’s descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia, DIM detected one approximately millimeter-sized particle at a distance of 5. 0 km from the nucleus’ barycenter, corresponding to an altitude of 2. 4 km from the surface. This is the closest ever dust detection at a cometary nucleus by a dedicated in situ dust detector; and (3) at Philae’s final landing site, Abydos, DIM detected no dust impact which may be due to low cometary activity in the vicinity of Philae or due to shading by obstacles close to Philae, or both. Results. Laboratory calibration experiments showed that the material properties of the detected particle are compatible with a porous particle having a bulk density of approximately 250 kg...|$|R

40|$|The Dust Impact Monitor (<b>DIM)</b> {{experiment}} on <b>board</b> the Rosetta spacecraft's lander, Philae, is a cube with three sides covered with piezo-electric (PZT) sensors (total sensitive area: ≈ 70 cm^ 2), aimed at measuring the physical properties of millimetric and sub-millimetric dust particles that move {{near the surface}} of comet 67 P/Churyumov—Gerasimenko. In this work we study {{the performance of the}} DIM Flight Spare (FS) unit based on impact experiments and compare the measurements with the sensor's expected theoretical behavior as derived from Hertz' theory of elastic impact. We present the results of impact experiments performed with spherical particles of different densities and elastic properties. We performed two types of experiments: (a) we analyze the performance of the different sensor sides under identical impacts, and (b) we investigate the performance of DIM under impacts of different materials and different impact speeds. We discuss the possible influence of the microstructure of the PZT sensor on the signal strength and its variation with position of the impacting particles. Our results show that the signal strength and the contact times measured with the DIM PZT sensors can be well approximated by Hertz’ contact mechanics...|$|R
