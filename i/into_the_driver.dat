5000|$|Unlike {{the stiff}} {{physical}} suspension built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of conventional speakers, the trapped air inside the sealed-loudspeaker enclosure {{provides a more}} linear restoring force for the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to oscillate a greater distance (excursion) in a linear fashion. This is a requirement for clean and loud reproduction of deep bass by drivers with relatively small cones.|$|E

5000|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{determined that}} the explosion {{was caused by a}} plastic bomb, molded to concentrate the force of its blast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> seat. The bomb was attached by wires or magnets to the car's underside and blew a [...] "circular hole, 2 to 2½ feet in diameter" [...] in the driver's seat. The bomb was not believed to have been controlled by a timing device or a remote-controlled detonator.|$|E
5000|$|... efun : An efun, or [...] "external function", {{is defined}} by the driver. Efuns are written in C and {{compiled}} statically <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> so they generally run much faster than other function types, but are more difficult to write and lack flexibility.

50|$|The {{day after}} the {{accident}} an official enquiry began, coinciding with an inquest <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and fireman, held in Shrewsbury and which was attended by the President of the Board of Trade, David Lloyd George. It lasted three days, the report being published on 12 February. No fault was found with the engine's braking power and reliability, while after detailed hearing into the health and sobriety of the driver, the finding was that alcohol and drugs were not present in his body from post-mortem examination and he had not suffered a seizure.|$|E

50|$|One {{model of}} airbags {{made by the}} Takata Corporation used {{ammonium}} nitrate-based gas generating compositions in airbag inflators instead of the more stable, but more expensive compound Tetrazole. The ammonium nitrate-based inflators have a flaw where old inflators with long-term exposure to hot and humid climate conditions could rupture during deployment, projecting metal shards though the airbag and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> The defect caused seven deaths and over 100 injuries in the U.S., and one death in Malaysia. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalled over 33 million vehicles in May 2015, and fined Takata $70 million in November 2015. Toyota, Mazda and Honda {{have said that they}} will not use ammonium nitrate inflators.|$|E
50|$|Talisman was a {{complete}} suite of software and hardware that attempted to solve the tiled rendering problem. The system shared some information about the tiles and the objects within {{them in order to}} find out which tiles were outdated. If a tile became outdated, the CPU was asked to re-render the objects in that tile, and send the results back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and then to the card. Once a particular tile was rendered on the card, it was stored on the card in compressed format so it could be re-used on future frames. Microsoft calculated that each tile could be re-used for about four frames on average, thereby reducing load on the CPU by about four times.|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} Chic {{was based}} on a real New York City cab driver who once drove writer, Allen Zipper to Laguardia airport. The line [...] "You want to fuck me or you want to fuck my Mercedes" [...] used in the series was an actual line that the driver used when talking about how woman in LA only cared about money.

5000|$|The van {{was named}} to Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1990 and 1991 and {{featured}} {{as one of their}} [...] "vehicles for the coming (fuel) crisis". Initial sales were strong as well, but rapidly fell off once other makers introduced all-wheel drive and V6 engines. In the years to come, Toyota's 1991 Previa, Nissan's 1993 Quest, and Honda's 1995 Odyssey had entered the market and began diluting Mazda's market share. Sales weren't helped when the MPV received one star out of four in the Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) crash tests and a [...] "Marginal" [...] rating in the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests for damage to the occupant compartment, tire intrusion <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> footwell area, poor dummy kinematics, and possibility of injuries to both legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} the charge well is used as the write operation in a computer memory, storing a single binary digit, or bit. A collection of dots or spaces, often one horizontal row on the display, represents a computer word. There is {{a relationship between the}} size and spacing of the dots and their lifetime, as well as the ability to reject crosstalk with adjacent dots. This places an upper limit on the memory density, and each Williams tube could typically store about 1024-2560 bits of data. Because the electron beam is essentially inertia-free and can be moved anywhere on the display, the computer can access any location, making it a random access memory. Typically the computer would load the address as an X and Y pair <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> circuitry and then trigger a time base generator that would sweep the selected locations, reading from or writing to the internal registers, normally implemented as flip-flops.|$|E

The roof of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cab is part of the body, not the roof. The four doors on the sides lead directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cabs and are made of light alloy.|$|R

5000|$|Dobyns {{became a}} Special Agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in 1987. Less {{than a week}} after {{beginning}} operational duty, he was taken hostage at gunpoint in the Tucson desert while serving an arrest warrant on a convicted felon who was recently released from prison. The suspect forced Dobyns <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> seat of the officers’ undercover car, which was immediately surrounded by the other agents with guns drawn. During a brief standoff, the agitated gunman repeatedly screamed at Dobyns to drive away. When Dobyns intentionally pulled the car keys from the ignition and dropped them to the floor, the assailant fired a single [...]38 caliber pistol bullet into Dobyns’ lung, which exited his upper chest. The other ATF agents instantly opened fire {{from both sides of the}} car, killing the gunman. Critically wounded, Dobyns was rushed to a Tucson hospital, where Dr. Richard Carmona, who later became the 17th United States Surgeon General, performed emergency trauma surgery that saved Dobyns’ life.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{candidates}} considered was TPC-E, {{which was supposed to}} be the new OLTP standard database benchmark with new complex models aimed at being representative of today’s computing environment. The TPC-E is based on a financial trading system model. Still, comparative results could not be obtained. The reason is that the TPC specifies requirements regarding what part of the code resides in the [...] "driver" [...] of the benchmark and what part resides in [...] "database" [...] functionality. However, the driver to application logic interface is completely defined at the data level. This means that when measuring relational access you would not incur any overhead for mapping into a C++ object. The mapping of the raw data into what ever form was necessary in the driver to implement the business logic was completely outside of the benchmark measurements. When it comes to the object database, you need to now un-map the C++ objects <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> data structures and in doing so, measure the cost of that activity as part of the benchmark timings.|$|E
5000|$|Golly! Ghost! (Gorī! Gōsuto!) is an electro-mechanical/video game hybrid {{released}} by Namco in 1990; it runs upon Namco System 2 hardware, and employs a diorama which {{is controlled by}} the game's driver board to open and close mechanical doors which are connected to solenoids, much like the moveable items on a pinball table. The diorama has five 24-volt globe lights that come on only during gameplay to light up the rooms - and they are all on when the game is being played during the shooting scenes, and off for the cutscenes, title screen, and high scores. The globes are not individually controlled, and are either all on or off; the driver board powers the diorama unit's solenoids and lights via several connectors on the driver board and the guns also plug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> board via another small connector (it was the first Namco game to use them). It was also the fourth game from Namco to allow scores not ending in [...] "0" [...] (after Hopping Mappy, 1986, Bakutotsu Kijūtei, 1988 and Metal Hawk, also 1988). In 2011, the game was adapted into a webcomic for Namco Bandai's ShiftyLook webcomic service.|$|E
