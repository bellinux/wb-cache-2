She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month. They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976. Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a <b>divorced</b> <b>couple.</b> Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.|$|E
5|$|Grant, {{demanding}} {{the truth from}} the Kirbys, learns they are actually a middle-class <b>divorced</b> <b>couple,</b> {{who are looking for}} their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned InGen compound, where Amanda is ambushed by a raptor. The group manages to trap it, but it escapes and contacts the rest of its pack. The group flees into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Grant retrieves Billy's satchel, while Udesky is left on the ground barely alive by the raptors, who set a trap in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.|$|E

30|$|Drawing {{from the}} data {{collected}} in the 2010 China Family Panel Study (CFPS) baseline survey, this paper studies the changing divorce pattern in Chinese marriages {{as a whole and}} for four cohorts. We find an inverted U-shape pattern in the divorce risk for Chinese marriages with the peak coming earlier over time. Family life cycle theory, natural evolvement theory, and population heterogeneity theory provide three different perspectives on interpreting the “inverted-U” shape divorce pattern. Family life cycle theory and natural evolvement theory are not supported by the data; however, population heterogeneity theory fits the data quite well. Split-population model shows that divorce risk for <b>divorced</b> <b>couples</b> increase linearly with marriage duration. However, the curve must come down at the end since {{the majority of the population}} does not divorce. By comparing four cohorts divided by marriage year, we find that the proportion of <b>divorced</b> <b>couples</b> has increased over time and the slope of the risk function for <b>divorced</b> <b>couples</b> has increased rapidly.|$|R

2500|$|During this period, Rekha {{was willing}} to expand her range beyond what she was given in {{mainstream}} films. She started working in arthouse pictures with independent directors, mostly under Shashi Kapoor's production, in what was used {{to be referred to}} as parallel cinema, an Indian New Wave movement known for its serious content and neo-realism. Her venture into this particular genre started off with Umrao Jaan, and was followed by other such films as Shyam Benegal's award-winning drama, Kalyug (1981), Govind Nihalani's Vijeta (1982), Girish Karnad's Utsav (1984) and Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), among others. Benegal's Kalyug is a modern-day adaptation of the Indian mythological epic Mahabharat, depicted as an archetypal-conflict between rival business houses. Rekha's role was that of Supriya, a character based on Draupadi. Benegal said he decided to cast her in the role after seeing her work in Khubsoorat, besides noticing that she was [...] "very keen, very serious about her profession". Critic and author Vijay Nair described her performance as [...] "a masterful interpretation of the modern Draupadi". In Vijeta she played a woman who struggles through her marital problems and tries to support her adolescent son, who, undecided about his future plans, eventually decides to join the Indian Air Force. She described her performance in the film as one of her favourite from her own repertoire. For her portrayal of Vasantsena in Utsav, an erotic comedy based on the fourth-century Sanskrit play Mrichhakatika (The Little Clay Cart), she was acknowledged as the Best Actress (Hindi) {{of the year by the}} Bengal Film Journalists' Association. Maithili Rao wrote for [...] "Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema", [...] "Rekha – forever the first choice for the courtesan's role, be it ancient Hindu India or 19th-century Muslim Lucknow – is all statuesque sensuality..." [...] In Gulzar's drama Ijaazat, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah star as a <b>divorced</b> <b>couple</b> who meet unexpectedly for the first time after years of separation at a railway station, and recall together their life as a married couple and the conflicts which brought about their eventual split.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} examine these two theories, we remove from our sample couples who remain married; instead, we focus on <b>divorced</b> <b>couples</b> and examine how their divorce risk changes over time. 4 According to {{population}} heterogeneity theory, {{the existence of the}} subpopulation having no divorce risk seriously interferes with the estimation of the overall divorce risk function; hence, the divorce risk function of <b>divorced</b> <b>couples</b> should substantively differ from the overall divorce risk function. In contrast, natural evolution theory assumes that the divorce pattern of those already divorced does not depart too much from the overall divorce pattern, and so this should also appear as an inverted-U shape.|$|R
