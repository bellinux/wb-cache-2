5|$|In the 1950s, {{theatrical}} designer Oliver Messel made {{a number}} of notable changes to the interior of the hotel, incorporating aspects of theatrical design into the hotel interior. He designed the lavish apartments on the 7th and 8th floors; the Oliver Messel Suite is named after him, designed in the Georgian country <b>house</b> <b>style.</b> Between 1988 and 1990, the hotel was completely renovated by Bob Lush of the Richmond Design Group at a cost of US$100million.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{continued}} to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the complexity and length of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture {{continued to}} follow that of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower <b>house</b> <b>style</b> would also be adopted in the north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward I built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.|$|E
5|$|ITC Garamond {{was created}} by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's <b>house</b> <b>style</b> of unusually high x-height. It was {{initially}} intended {{to serve as a}} display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed text. As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.|$|E

5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the <b>house</b> <b>style</b> of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL <b>house</b> <b>style</b> of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century ranch <b>house</b> <b>style</b> has {{its roots}} in North American Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of the 17th to 19th century. These buildings used single story floor plans and native materials in a simple style {{to meet the needs of}} their inhabitants. Walls were often built of adobe brick and covered with plaster, or more simply used board and batten wood siding. Roofs were low and simple, and usually had wide eaves to help shade the windows from the Southwestern heat. Buildings often had interior courtyards which were surrounded by a U shaped floor plan. Large front porches were also common. These low slung, thick-walled, rustic working ranches were common in the Southwestern states.|$|E
