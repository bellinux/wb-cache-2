I investigated the mechanism of DNR carcinogenicity and its interaction with E in SD rats by studying DNR-DNA adduct formation and the influence of E status on DNR clearance and free radical producing and <b>detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes.</b> ^ The hypothesis was that DNR exerts its tumorigenic effect via free radicals generated during redox cycling and production of reactive intermediates capable of forming DNA adducts. E was postulated to act as a protective agent through a combination of its antioxidant property, modulation of drug clearance and levels of free radical producing and <b>detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes.</b> ^ DNA adduct formation was measured by the nuclease P 1 32 P-post labeling assay. In vitro, DNR was activated by rat liver microsomes and either NADPH or cumene hydrogen peroxide (CuOOH). Rat liver DNA incubated with this mixture formed two adducts when the cofactor was NADPH and three adducts when CuOOH was used. In vivo, SD rats were treated with i. v. doses of DNR. No detectable DNR-DNA adducts were formed in liver or mammary DNA in vivo, although there was an intensification of endogenous DNA adducts. ^ Groups, 1, 2, 3 and 4 of weanling female SD rats were fed 0, 100, 1, 000 and 10, 000 mg α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet respectively. A comparison of Groups 1 and 4 showed no effect of E status on clearance of 10 mg tritiated DNR/kg body weight over 72 hours. However, liver cleared DNR at a faster rate than mammary epithelial cells (MEC). ^ Xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes DNR redox cycling, was significantly decreased in liver and MEC of rats in group 4 compared to groups 1, 2, and 3. <b>Detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes</b> were not dramatically affected by E supplementation. Quinone reductase in MEC was significantly increased in group 4 compared to other groups. Overall, the liver had higher levels of free radical <b>detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes</b> compared to MEC. ^ These data support a role of free radicals in DNR carcinogenicity because (1) endogenous DNA adducts formed due to free radical insult are further intensified by DNR treatment in vivo, (2) MEC, the specific target of DNR carcinogenicity, cannot rapidly clear DNR and have a lower free radical detoxifying capability than liver, (3) E supplementation caused lowering of free radical generating potential via xanthine oxidase, and increased DNR detoxification due to elevation of quinone reductase in MEC. ...|$|R

Since the development of the first synthetic insecticide in 1939, humans have invested considerable effort to stay ahead of resistance phenotypes that repeatedly develop in insects. Aphids are a group of insects that have become global pests in agriculture and frequently exhibit insecticide resistance. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, has developed resistance to at least seventy different synthetic compounds, and different insecticide resistance mechanisms have been reported worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings: To further characterize this resistance, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptional responses in three genotypes of M. persicae, each exhibiting different resistance mechanisms, in response to an anti-cholinesterase insecticide. The sensitive genotype (exhibiting no resistance mechanism) responded to the insecticide by up-regulating 183 genes primarily ones related to energy metabolism, <b>detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes,</b> proteins of extracellular transport, peptidases and cuticular proteins. The second genotype (resistant through a kdr sodium channel mutation), up-regulated 17 genes coding for <b>detoxifying</b> <b>enzymes,</b> peptidase and cuticular proteins. Finally, a multiply resistant genotype (carrying kdr and a modified acetylcholinesterase), up-regulated only 7 genes, appears not to require induced insecticide detoxification, and instead down-regulated many genes.

The increase in lipid peroxidation was related with increased electrical conductivity, which suggested membrane damage during deterioration. The decrease in germination was also associated with a decrease in catalase and peroxidase activity and as a result, the antioxidant system was not sufficient to protect seeds against free radical damage.
