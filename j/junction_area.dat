25|$|The {{contentious}} new railway between Muiredge Den and Methil {{was started}} in October 1899; it was completed and opened in January 1901. It was six miles in length, and single track, starting in the west at Duncan siding, linking Lochhead and Hugo pits, with a new east-facing connection to Michael. It then crossed the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and turned north up Wemyss Den, running close to the 1887 Wellsgreen line, then crossing it by a diamond crossing; the earlier restrictive agreements required Wellsgreen traffic to be worked to Wemyss Castle. It then ran north and east, joining the Bowman branch to Isabella pit, and then crossing {{the route of the}} NBR Muiredge branch. Running north-south this had become dormant when more direct routes for Muiredge coal had been built, and the NBR had agreed that it might be severed to allow the new line to pass through west to east. Spur connections north and south were made to the stubs of that line; the <b>junction</b> <b>area</b> was known as Muiredge Plunks. The line continued east through Starkey's Wood, turning tightly to the south-west and crossing over the Methil extension railway, to terminate at Denbeath pit on the shore.|$|E
25|$|The East New York Depot, {{also called}} the East New York Base Shops, is located at One Jamaica Avenue/25 Jamaica Avenue at Bushwick Avenue in the Broadway <b>Junction</b> <b>area</b> of East New York, Brooklyn, {{just east of the}} New York City Subway's East New York Yard. The five-story {{structure}} is steel-framed with a brick exterior, with two stories for bus storage and repair shops. The facility was built to perform heavy maintenance, and served as New York City Bus' central maintenance facility until the opening of the Zerega and Grand Avenue facilities. Buses enter and exit the complex via numerous doors on Jamaica Avenue, with an additional vehicle entrance {{at the north end of}} the complex at Bushwick Avenue. The depot was built to house over 300 buses. It currently has space for around 280 buses, including two additional outdoor parking lots south of the depot: Havens Lot at Havens Place between Herkimer Street and Atlantic Avenue, and Herkimer Lot at Herkimer Street and Williams Place underneath the BMT Canarsie Line. The depot also features a paint shop, which is decommissioned and has been used to store buses at times. The north end of the depot (1720 Bushwick Avenue) is used to maintain the museum bus fleet along with Amsterdam Depot, and contains a repair shop for MTA Bus. Also, plans are underway to modify this depot to accommodate articulated-buses in the very near future.|$|E

25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee <b>Junction</b> <b>area</b> in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this thesis deals with the issues of real time traffic {{management}} in <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> and bottleneck sections on mainline railways {{in the event of}} service disturbances. A systematic methodology is proposed for modelling and solving real time train rescheduling problems in <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> and bottleneck sections, including train re-sequencing and train re-timing. A formal mathematical model, the Junction Rescheduling Model (JRM) is proposed, based on a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to minimise a Weighted Average Delay (WAD). An innovative algorithm based on Differential Evolution algorithm, named DE_JRM is proposed for solving real time train rescheduling problems formulated with JRM. The performance of the algorithm DE_JRM has been evaluated with a stochastic method based on Monte-Carlo simulation methodology. The evaluation results show a good performance for both flyover and flat junctions compared with First Come First Served (FCFS) and a conventional ARS strategy. The author also extends the proposed methodology, including JRM and the algorithm DE_JRM, to model and solve real time train rescheduling problems for bottleneck sections of railway networks. Finally, an integrated system architecture for the traffic management and train control is introduced for system implementation of the proposed methodology of train rescheduling in <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> and bottleneck sections on mainline railways. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Compressive and tensile {{properties}} of non-twisted and twisted carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles are studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results reveal that non-twisted CNT bundles exhibit better compressive and {{tensile properties}} than twisted CNT bundles. When the twist angle of a CNT bundle {{is greater than}} 60 °, its buckling load dropped considerably due to the significant curve geometries of the surrounding single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Twisted CNT bundles also do not demonstrate good tensile properties. During tensile loading, the intertube distance in CNT bundle with twisting angle greater than 75 ° will decrease as the strain increases. This gives rise to increasing intertube van der Waals forces until the intertube distance falls below 2. 0 Å. At this time, the repulsive force between the SWCNTs suddenly increases causing the SWCNTs to repel one another at <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> where they overlap. As a result, twisted CNT bundles tend to fail at these <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> with lower failure load and strain...|$|R

40|$|The slot-antenna mixer {{is a new}} quasi-optical SIS mixer design which {{attempts}} to simultaneously solve the antenna pattern and impedance-matching problems to obtain highly efficient radiation coupling. The mixers have been fabricated by the authors at JPL's Microdevices Laboratory (MDL). The devices employ robust Nb/Al-oxide/Nb tunnel junctions, and have been tested at Caltech. A receiver noise temperature of 420 K (DSB) was measured at 500 GHz, {{which is the best}} yet reported for an SIS or Schottky mixer at this frequency. The design of this mixer is readily scalable to 1000 GHz with current fabrication capabilities. The design allows reasonable <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> to be used, even at high frequencies, which can easily be fabricated using the NbiAl-Oxicleil sTh and NbN/IvIg 0 / 114 bN processes. For example, an 800 Gliz mixer requires a single <b>junction</b> with an <b>area</b> of about 0. 5 11,m 2. The larger <b>junction</b> <b>areas</b> alleviate the effects of mixer saturation and allow strong suppression of the noise from the Josephson effect by the application of a magnetic field.
