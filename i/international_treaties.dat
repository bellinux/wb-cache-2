5|$|The red-throated loon {{has a large}} global {{population}} and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution, and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various gull species, and both red and Arctic foxes, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by <b>international</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give <b>international</b> <b>treaties</b> and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|In October 1887, Riley and the {{association}} joined with other writers to petition the United States Congress {{to attempt to}} negotiate <b>international</b> <b>treaties</b> to protect American copyrights abroad. The group {{became known as the}} International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts. When traveling to one of the league's meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by Bell's palsy. He recovered after three weeks, but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcohol addiction. He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol {{with the help of a}} minister, but again soon returned to his old habit.|$|E
40|$|In Indonesia, here is no exact politic {{and legal}} system {{regarding}} {{the application of}} <b>International</b> <b>Treaty</b> within national legal system. Article 11 of Indonesian Constitution 1945 merely envisages the division of authority between President and Parliament in ratifying <b>international</b> <b>treaty,</b> however, such article does not state clearly Indonesia’s legal politics concerning the application of <b>international</b> <b>treaty</b> within national legal system. The lack of clarification on Indonesia’s legal and political system in such area raises problems {{in the application of}} <b>international</b> <b>treaty</b> domestically. This research is aimed to:  (1) analyses Indonesia’s legal politic concerning the application of <b>international</b> <b>treaty</b> towards Indonesian Constitution 1945 as well as other legal instruments; (2) analyses legal implications of <b>international</b> <b>treaty</b> upon Indonesia’s national interests and; (3) propose concept on legal politic regarding the application of <b>international</b> <b>treaty</b> in Indonesia. Since legal politic is crucial in supporting which law should be implemented towards state’s national goal, it is important to clarify Indonesia’s legal politic concerning the implementation of <b>international</b> <b>treaty.</b> As stated by Hans Kelsen, that as the application of the rule of law, a state should eliminate existing inconsistency and overlaps of its laws. </p...|$|R

5|$|On the {{diplomatic}} front, the ministers of foreign nations, {{gathered in the}} open harbor of Hyōgo (present day Kobe) in early February, issued a declaration according to which the Shogunate was still considered the only rightful government in Japan, giving hope to Tokugawa Yoshinobu that foreign nations (especially France) might consider an intervention in his favour. A few days later however an Imperial delegation visited the ministers declaring that the Shogunate was abolished, that harbours would be open in accordance with <b>International</b> <b>treaties,</b> and that foreigners would be protected. The ministers finally decided to recognize the new government.|$|E
5|$|Political parties {{gather in}} the National Assembly, which {{consists}} of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote.

The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Belgian {{politics}} {{had been}} dominated {{in the interwar period}} by the Catholic Party, usually in coalition with the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP) or the Liberal Party. The 1930s {{also saw the}} rise in popularity of Fascist parties within Belgium; most notably Rex which peaked at the 1936 election with 11% of the vote. From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving <b>international</b> <b>treaties</b> and alliances and attempting to maintain good diplomatic relations with both Britain, France and Germany.|$|E

5|$|<b>International</b> <b>treaties</b> may be {{necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with <b>international</b> <b>treaties</b> designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control {{over a five-year period}} and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and <b>international</b> <b>treaties.</b> After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms <b>international</b> <b>treaties.</b> The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E
5|$|Scottish privateers and pirates preyed on {{shipping}} in the North Sea {{and off the}} Atlantic {{coast of}} France. Scotland's Admiralty court judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods. As the court was entitled to {{a tenth of the}} value of a prize, it was a profitable business for the admiral. The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using their letters of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561. The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth, while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases. During the Rough Wooing in 1542, the Mary Willoughby, the Lion, and the Salamander under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called the Antony of Bruges in a creek on the coast of Brittany. In 1544 Edinburgh was attacked by an English marine force and burnt. The Salamander and the Scottish-built Unicorn were captured at Leith. The Scots still had two royal naval vessels and numerous smaller private vessels, but would have to rely on privateers until the re-establishment of a royal fleet in the 1620s. When, {{as a result of the}} series of <b>international</b> <b>treaties,</b> the emperor Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries. They also operated in the West Indies from the 1540s, joining the French in the capture of Burburuta in 1567. English and Scottish naval warfare and privateering broke out sporadically in the 1550s. In 1559, English captain William Winter was sent north with 34 ships and dispersed and captured the Scottish and French fleets, leading to the eventual evacuation of the French from Scotland, and a successful coup of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Scottish and English interests were re-aligned and the naval conflict subsided.|$|E
