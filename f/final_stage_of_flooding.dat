500|$|The Gravemind is a parasitic, hive mind {{intelligence}} in the Halo universe. While only one Gravemind is ever seen in the games, the title {{is given to the}} <b>final</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>Flood</b> evolution, in which the Flood becomes a superorganism. [...] The Flood is a highly-infectious parasite which is released several times during Halos story. The Chief and the Arbiter (Thel'Vadam, during the course of Halo 2 and Halo 3) are captured during their separate missions on Delta Halo, or Installation 05, by a Gravemind, which resides {{in the bowels of the}} ancient Forerunner ringworld, where the Flood creature forges an alliance between the two foes in order to stop the activation of the ringworld — an event which would destroy all sentient life, and, therefore, starve the Flood. The character is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA DOE {{sponsored}} pilot-scale {{project has}} been funded in which 30, 000 metric tons of CO 2 will be injected in {{the upper part of}} the Mississippian reservoir to verify CO 2 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) potential at Wellington field in South Kansas. Many conventional Mississippian oilfields in Kansas are going through <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> water <b>flooding</b> and are at CO 2 miscible or near miscible conditions. Wellington Field represents a typical Kansas Mississippian reservoir with very well documented production/injection history and proven performance and, therefore, it is ideal candidate for CO 2 EOR. The main objective of this work is to evaluate reservoir properties, predict reservoir response, and evaluate possible risks for CO 2 EOR in the Mississippian reservoir at Wellington Field...|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} of volcanogenic sulphur {{into the upper}} atmosphere by explosive eruptions is known to cause significant temporary climate cooling. Therefore, phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinian eruptions occurring during the <b>final</b> rifting <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> active <b>flood</b> basalt provinces provide a potent mechanism for triggering climate change. During the early Eocene, the northeast Atlantic margin was subjected to repeated ashfall for 0. 5 m. y. This {{was the result of}} extensive phreatomagmatic activity along 3000 km of the opening northeast Atlantic rift. These widespread, predominantly basaltic ashes are now preserved in marine sediments of the Balder Formation and its equivalents, and occur over an area extending from the Faroe Islands to Denmark and southern England. These ash-bearing sediments also contain pollen and spore floras derived from low diversity forests that grew in cooler, drier climates than were experienced either before or after these highly explosive eruptions. In addition, coeval plant macrofossil evidence from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, also shows a comparable pattern of vegetation change. The coincidence of the ashes and cooler climate pollen and spore floras in northwest Europe identifies volcanism as the primary cause of climate cooling. Estimates show that whilst relatively few phreatomagmatic eruptive centres along the 3000 km opening rift system could readily generate 0. 5 – 1 °C cooling, on an annual basis, only persistent or repeated volcanic phases {{would have been able to}} achieve the long-term cooling effect observed in the floral record. We propose that the cumulative effect of repeated Balder Formation eruptions initiated a biodiversity crisis in the northeast Atlantic margin forests. Only the decline of this persistent volcanic activity, and the subsequent climatic warming at the start of the Eocene Thermal Maximum allowed the growth of subtropical forests to develop across the region...|$|R
