40|$|In our {{characterization}} of mouse strains carrying mutations in nuclear receptor and aromatase genes {{we have found}} phenotypes which resemble four human diseases: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), Sjögren s syndrome (SS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The work in this thesis was designed to understand the roles of LXRalpha, LXRbeta and aromatase in development of these diseases and to investigate whether these animal models help us (1) to understand the etiology of the corresponding human diseases and (2) to develop new therapeutic approaches {{for the treatment of}} these diseases. Paper I: Male LXRbeta-/- mice develop motor neuron disease with age. Because the LXR ligand, beta-sitosterol, has been implicated in ALS, we examined the possibility that LXRbeta-/- mice were more susceptible than their wild type (WT) littermates to the toxic effects of beta-sitosterol. Three weeks of beta-sitosterol treatment of 8 -month-old LXRbeta-/- male mice resulted in ALS-Parkinson s like syndrome, characterized by death of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons in the brain and death of large motor neurons in the spinal cord. WT mice were not affected by beta-sitosterol. In LXRbeta-/- mice, there was activation of microglia and accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates in motor neurons, abnormalities which have been observed in ALS patients. The level of 24 -hydroxycholesterol, the main <b>excretory</b> <b>metabolite</b> of cholesterol synthesized in the brain, was increased upon beta-sitosterol treatment in mutant but not in WT mice. Thus loss of LXRbeta renders mice more susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of beta-sitosterol and we suggest that, in human populations where the incidence of ALS is unusually high, there may be genetic alterations in LXRbeta gene signaling pathways. Paper II: In this study we found that as LXRalpha-/- mice age, they develop smooth-muscle actin-positive stromal overgrowth around the ducts of the ventral prostate (VP) and numerous fibrous nodules growing into the ducts and causing obstruction and extreme dilatation of the ducts. We investigated whether the stromal hyperplasia in LXRalpha-/- mice could help in understanding the etiology of human BPH. We found proliferation in the epithelial cells but not in the accumulated stromal cells in the VP of LXRalpha-/- mice. Expression of the transcription repressor of E-cadherin, Snail and the intracellular mediator of TGF-beta, Smad 2 / 3, was increased. We postulate that loss of LXRalpha from the prostatic epithelium results in increased epithelial proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, resulting in excessive stromal accumulation. These findings suggest that LXRalpha-/- mice may be a useful model to study prostatic stromal hyperplasia. Paper III: LXRbeta-/- mice are resistant to developing obesity on a high fat diet. As they age, these mice develop pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. By electron microscopy, abnormalities in the pancreatic ducts {{as well as in the}} pancreatic secretion were found. Particularly interesting was the presence within the ducts of lamellar structures similar to those seen in cystic fibrosis. With a specific antibody we demonstrated the presence of LXRbeta in the nuclei of epithelial cells lining the pancreatic ducts. We therefore searched for LXR-regulated genes that might influence the density of pancreatic secretion. We found that aquaporin- 1 is an LXR-regulated gene highly expressed in the pancreatic ductal epithelium of wild type mice but not LXRbeta-/- mice. Thus LXRbeta plays an important role in controlling pancreatic juice secretion through the regulation of water transport, and the observed resistance to a high fat diet in these LXRbeta-/- mice appears to be due to fat malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insufficiency. Paper IV: As they age, mice which cannot synthesize estrogen (aromatase knock-out mice, ArKO mice), develop severe autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling Sjögren s syndrome (SS), which is not observed in ERalpha-/- or ERbeta-/- mice. Many characteristics typical of human SS were found in these mice: There is B cell hyperplasia in the hematopoietic organs with severe immune cell infiltration in the salivary glands and kidneys, proteolytic fragments of alpha-fodrin in the salivary glands and anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies in the serum. When mice were raised on a phytoestrogen-free diet, there was a mild but significant incidence of infiltration of B lymphocytes in WT mice and severe destructive autoimmune lesions in ArKO mice. In age-matched WT mice fed a diet containing normal levels of phytoestrogen, there were no autoimmune lesions. These findings suggest that estrogen deficiency results in a lympho-proliferative autoimmune disease resembling SS and suggest that estrogen might have clinical value in the prevention or treatment of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Prediction {{of human}} drug {{metabolism}} {{is important for}} drug devel-opment. Recently, {{the number of new}} drug candidates metabo-lized by not only cytochrome P 450 (P 450) but also non-P 450 has been increasing. It is necessary to consider species differences in drug metabolism between humans and experimental animals. We examined species differences of drug metabolism, especially be-tween humans and rats, for ibuprofen and (S) -naproxen as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are metabolized by P 450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferase, and amino acid N-acyltransferase for taurine conjugation in liver, using hu-man chimeric mice (h-PXB mice) repopulated with human hepato-cytes and rat chimeric mice (r-PXB mice) transplanted with rat hepatocytes. We performed the direct comparison of <b>excretory</b> <b>metabolites</b> in urine between h-PXB mice and reported data for humans as well as between r-PXB mice and rats after administra-tion of ibuprofen and (S) -naproxen. Good agreement for urinary metabolites (percentage of dose) was observed not only between humans and h-PXB mice but also between rats and r-PXB mice. Therefore, the metabolic profiles in humans and rats reflected those in h-PXB mice and r-PXB mice. Our results indicated that h-PXB mice should be helpful for predicting the quantitative met-abolic profiles of drugs mediated by P 450 and non-P 450 in liver, and r-PXB mice should be helpful for evaluation of species differ-ences in these metabolic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are {{stable in}} the {{atmosphere}} and may reach the stratosphere. They are cleaved by UV-radiation in the stratosphere to yield chlorine radicals, which are thought {{to interfere with the}} catalytic cycle of ozone formation and destruction and deplete stratospheric ozone concentrations. Due to potential adverse health effects of ozone depletion, chlorofluorocarbon replacements with much lower or absent ozone depleting potential are developed. The toxicology of these compounds that represent chlorofluorohydrocarbons (HCFCs) or fluorohydrocarbons (HFCs) has been intensively studied. All compounds investigated (1, 1 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethane [HCFC- 141 b], 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane [HFC- 134 a], pentafluoroethane [HFC- 125], 1 -chloro- 1, 2, 2, 2 -tetrafluoroethane [HCFC- 124], and 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethane [HCFC- 123]) show only a low potential for skin and eye irritation. Chronic adverse effects on the liver (HCFC- 123) and the testes (HCFC- 141 b and HCFC- 134 a), including tumor formation, were observed in long-term inhalation studies in rodents using very high concentrations of these CFC replacements. All CFC replacements are, to varying extents, biotransformed in the organism, mainly by cytochrome P 450 -catalyzed oxidation of C-H bonds. The formed acyl halides are hydrolyzed to give excretable carboxylic acids; halogenated aldehydes that are formed may be further oxidized to halogenated carboxylic acids or reduced to halogenated alcohols, which are <b>excretory</b> <b>metabolites</b> in urine from rodents exposed experimentally to CFC replacements. The chronic toxicity of the CFC replacements studied is unlikely to be of relevance for humans exposed during production and application of CFC replacements...|$|R
40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{programs are}} increasingly {{being used as a}} management option for threatened mammals. The greater bilby Macrotis lagotis, for example, is a vulnerable species which is maintained in captivity at several facilities in Australia. Non-invasive evaluation of stress hormones (cortisol in mammals) via <b>excretory</b> <b>metabolites</b> can be used to monitor physiological stress responses of captive individuals. In this study, we validated an enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) to measure cortisol metabolites in fresh faecal samples of adult male and female bilbies (n = 7) held in captivity at the Dreamworld Theme Park, Queensland, Australia. The faecal cortisol EIA was validated via parallelism and the recovery of exogenous cortisol added to pooled faecal extracts (> 99 % recovery). Female bilbies had higher average faecal cortisol metabolite concentrations and higher day-to-day variation than male bilbies; however, there was no relationship with bilby age. Cortisol metabolites for most individuals varied widely through time, with numerous peaks and troughs in response to long-term stressors (illnesses, injury and reproductive issues) and short-term stressors, such as use in shows at Dreamworld or public displays in local schools, manual restraint and short-term veterinary procedures (e. g. general anaesthesia). Overall, the higher mean cortisol metabolite concentrations of individuals suffering long-term stress was related to a greater response to short-term stressors. This suggests an interaction between responses to short-term and long-term stressors which is perhaps due to habituation and/or facilitation of long-term stressors. Non-invasive faecal monitoring of stress hormones could provide further information on the implications of captive breeding programs and the release of animals reared in captivity.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of veliparib [(R) - 2 -(2 -methylpyrrolidin- 2 -yl) - 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole- 4 -carboxamide, ABT- 888], a novel and potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase {{for the treatment}} of can-cers, was investigated in rats and dogs after intravenous and oral administration of [3 H]veliparib and compared with that of humans. Veliparib absorption was high. Dosed radioactivity was widely dis-tributed in rat tissues. The majority of drug-related material was excreted in urine as unchanged drug (approximately 54, 41, and 70 % of the dose in rats, dogs, and humans, respectively). A lactam M 8 and an amino acid M 3 were two major <b>excretory</b> <b>metabolites</b> in animals. In the circulation of animals and humans, veliparib was the major drug-related component, and M 8 was one of the major metabolites. Monooxygenated metabolite M 2 was significant in the rat and dog, and M 3 was also significant in the dog. Veliparib biotransformation occurred on the pyrrolidine moiety via formation of a lactam, an amino acid, and an N-carbamoyl glucuronide, in addition to oxidation on benzoimidazole carboxamide and sequen-tial glucuronidation. In vitro experiments using recombinant hu-man cytochrome P 450 (P 450) enzymes identified CYP 2 D 6 as the major enzymemetabolizing veliparib with minor contributions from CYP 1 A 2, 2 C 19, and 3 A 4. Veliparib did not inhibit or induce the activities of major human P 450 s. Veliparib was a weak P-glycopro-tein (P-gp) substrate, showing no P-gp inhibition. Taken together, these studies indicate a low potential for veliparib to cause clini-cally significant P-gp or P 450 -mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Overall, the favorable dispositional and DDI profiles of ve-liparib should be beneficial to its safety and efficacy...|$|R
