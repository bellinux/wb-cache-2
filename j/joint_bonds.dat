500|$|The Economist {{provides}} a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that [...] "a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than break-up of the euro". The recipe to this tricky {{combination of the}} limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require [...] "access to money and for banks to have a [...] "safe" [...] euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country" [...] which could be obtained by [...] "narrower Eurobond that mutualises {{a limited amount of}} debt for a limited amount of time". The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, [...] "everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these <b>joint</b> <b>bonds</b> until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some €2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash." [...] So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} comprehensive data set of all bonds issued by the sixteen German federal states (Länder) since 1992. It thus provides a complete picture of a capital market comparable in size to the combined corporate bond and commercial paper market in Germany. The quantitative analysis reveals that Länder follow different issuing strategies: while some concentrate {{to a greater extent}} on large issues or issue <b>joint</b> <b>bonds</b> with other Länder (Jumbos), others rely more on comparatively small but frequent issues. Moreover, some Länder issue a significant volume-share of their bonds in foreign currencies. Suitable bonds are used to compute time series of yields for the respective Länder at a daily frequency as well as a liquidity measure. Based on the unique data set, we document that spreads of Länder yields to the Bund are driven to a great extent by general risk aversion. Public debt only has an economically marginal impact. Moreover, the recent refusal of the Federal Constitutional Court to grant additional federal funds to the city-state of Berlin did not change the risk assessment of German Länder by financial markets. Recent market turbulences have manifestly contributed to widening spreads as well as increased responsiveness of Länder spreads to international measures of risk aversion.

40|$|It {{was aimed}} {{in this study}} to {{determine}} the effect of the number of joints in frames produced from Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and of the type of adhesive on the diagonal tensile strength (DTS) of the frame. With this objective, a total of 152 specimens were prepared from OSB in accordance with the principles in the EN 2470 test standard. The diagonal tensile test was applied to the specimens in the universal test equipment in accordance with ASTM-D 1037. According to the statistical analysis of the data obtained from the tests, the number of dovetail joints and the type of adhesive had significant effects on the DTS.

The objective {{of this study is to}} measure the influence that humidity has on the fatigue crack growth velocity of two distinct adhesives characterized using the Paris Law, using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens in unaged and various aged conditions loaded in mode I in order to understand the influence that water content has on the Paris Law constants. It was found that the slope of the Paris Law curve is not heavily changed with the presence of water, but a shift in the curves does occur, generally resulting in a crack initiating at a lower threshold than in the unaged adhesive. Based on this behaviour, it can be concluded that an increase in water content reduces the fatigue joint strength and lifespan of adhesive <b>joints</b> <b>bonded</b> with the studied adhesives...|$|R

40|$|Several {{unexpected}} fatigue {{failures of}} polymer <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> used to repair damaged critical {{structures such as}} aircraft control surfaces have been reported in-service. The fatigue life and fatigue life scatter in polymer <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> {{was found to be}} highly dependent on the rate of stiffness degradation of the polymer adhesive layer under fatigue cycle. Since stiffness is a function of shape and boundary condition and not just material, this makes the static strength of <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> unsuitable for assessing and predicting fatigue life. The stiffness degradation of the polymer <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> led to in-homogenous strain hardening of the adhesive layer leading to eventual brittle fracture. The in-homogenous regional strain hardening in the polymer joint adhesive layer was caused by fabricated defects and anomalies.

The <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> is composed of a cast-iron rod and a GFRP composite pipe as adherends, and ductile PMMA as adhesive material (Plexus AO 425). Tubular-lap <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> were fabricated conveniently and consistently with a devised mold and a curing condition to yield a reliable test data set. Experiment was performed to measure creep compliances of the PMMA material, and constant strain rate (CSR) and fatigue strengths of the <b>bonded</b> <b>joint</b> under various loading and temperature conditions. We observed the CSR and fatigue strengths significantly depended on time and temperature, but little on direction of loadings and size of <b>joints.</b> The <b>bonded</b> <b>joints</b> failed under consistent damage mechanism in {{the combination of the}} cohesive and interfacial failure modes, which mainly occurred in the adhesive material and at the interface between the cast-iron rod and the adhesive material, respectively.
