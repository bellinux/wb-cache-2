But just like {{once it was}} partitioned in physics by Newton, it is partitioned in languages, and each language does it in a unique manner, depending on the variety of its linguistic means.

Although it has a binary wordformation function (as a radical in derived colour lexemes and as a morpheme in compounds), it is not a basic colour term in contemporary Chinese, there are separate psychologically salient terms for ‘green’, ‘blue’ and ‘black’. This paper focuses on the semantic analysis of all the existing meanings of 青qīng, determines the sequence of their acquisition and brings forward the hypothesis about the reasons for such syncretism. For Chinese people the polysemy of 青qīng does not create any confusion. Chinese linguists, however, acknowledge that dictionaries are not always able to give a thorough explanation.

Examples are land parcels, school districts, and state territories. However, many new, emerging applications are interested in modeling and processing geographic data that are inherently characterized by spatial vagueness or spatial indeterminacy. This requires novel concepts {{due to the lack}} of adequate approaches and systems. In this chapter, we focus on an important kind of spatial vagueness called spatial fuzziness. Spatial fuzziness captures the property of many spatial objects in reality which do not have sharp boundaries and interiors or whose boundaries and interiors cannot be precisely determined. We will designate this kind of entities as fuzzy spatial objects. Examples are air polluted areas, temperature zones, and lakes. We propose an abstract, formal, and conceptual model of so-called fuzzy spatial data types (that is, a fuzzy spatial algebra) introducing fuzzy points, fuzzy lines, and fuzzy regions in the two-dimensional Euclidean space. This chapter provides a definition of their structure and semantics, which is supposed to serve as a specification of their implementation. Further, we introduce fuzzy spatial set operations like <b>fuzzy</b> <b>union,</b> fuzzy intersection, and fuzzy difference as well as fuzzy topological predicates as they are useful in fuzzy spatial joins and fuzzy spatial selections.

40|$|Boolean models {{based on}} expert {{knowledge}} {{are often used}} to classify soils into {{a limited number of}} classes of a difficult-to-measure soil attribute. Although the primary data used for these classifications contain information on whether the soil is a typical class member or a boundary case between two classes, this is not retained in the final result. Such information is relevant in land use planning and soil management as it enables more flexible decision taking, but in the pre-digital era it was unfeasible to prevent the loss of it. We can now retain this information by fuzzifying the Boolean model using fuzzy logic. Choices must then be made on the type of membership function, logical operators, and formulation of the assessment rules. From a review of the main types of membership functions we conclude that piecewise linear functions are most appropriate in practical applications. Combinations of different <b>fuzzy</b> <b>union</b> (or) and intersection (and) connectives were tested on a 2 -dimensional example. Nearly all combinations gave results that partly contradict the associated a priori knowledge, the exception being the Bounded sum connective for or, and the Product connective for and. We also found that in formulating the rules, overlap of predictor classes and negation should be avoided. Unrestricted choice of fuzzy connectives and rule formulation will generally lead to inconsistencies. The selected methods were tested in two case studies: one on suitability for seed-potatoes in an Italian region and one on suitability for grass farming in a Dutch region. The maps produced with the fuzzy and Boolean models are broadly similar. However, maps from the fuzzy models indicate that some areas represent a transition between two original Boolean classes, thereby providing relevant additional information. In the case study on seed-potatoes the quantitative prediction errors of the original Boolean suitability map were greatly reduced by the fuzzification...|$|E

Fuzzy ART self-organizes stable recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of analog or binary input patterns.

Complement coding preserves individual feature amplitudes while normalizing the input vector, and prevents a potential category proliferation problem. Adaptive weights :otart equal to one and can only decrease in time. A geometric interpretation of fuzzy AHT represents each category as a box that increases in size as weights decrease. A matching criterion controls search, determining how close an input and a learned representation must be for a category to accept the input as a new exemplar. A vigilance parameter (p) sets the matching criterion and determines how finely or coarsely an ART system will partition inputs. High vigilance creates fine categories, represented by small boxes. Learning stops when boxes cover the input space. With fast learning, fixed vigilance, and an arbitrary input set, learning stabilizes after just one presentation of each input. A fast-commit slow-recode option allows rapid learning of rare events yet buffers memories against recoding by noisy inputs. Fuzzy ARTMAP unites two fuzzy ART networks to solve supervised learning and prediction problems. A Minimax Learning Rule controls ARTMAP category structure, conjointly minimizing predictive error and maximizing code compression. Low vigilance maximizes compression but may therefore cause very different inputs {{to make the same}} prediction. When this coarse grouping strategy causes a predictive error, an internal match tracking control process increases vigilance just enough to correct the error. ARTMAP automatically constructs a minimal number of recognition categories, or "hidden units," to meet accuracy criteria. An ARTMAP voting strategy improves prediction by training the system several times using different orderings of the input set. Voting assigns confidence estimates to competing predictions given small, noisy, or incomplete training sets. ARPA benchmark simulations illustrate fuzzy ARTMAP dynamics.

40|$|The {{benefit of}} {{computing}} with linguistic terms is now generally accepted. Fuzzy set theory provides us the conceptual {{tool for the}} interpretation and evaluation of linguistic concepts and expressions. It constitutes a quantification of the compatibility degree of objects with the associated linguistic concept through a membership function. When we make computation using fuzzy membership values {{such as in the}} evaluation of fuzzy rules confidence, the implicit assumptions are that the membership values have quantitative semantics (the extensive scale assumption) and that the numeric values are commensurate among the different fuzzy sets generated by the different concepts involved (the common scale assumption). In most situations these assumptions are difficult to justify and may lead to various anomalies. The membership values are more suitably interpreted only as ordinal scales where the numeric representations reflect compatibility orderings.

Mathematical morphology provides a systematic approach to analyze the geometric characteristics of signals or images, and has been applied widely too many applications such as edge detection, objection segmentation, noise suppression and so on.

In this paper, our aim is to relax the constraints which can be expressed in a conceptual model using the modeling tool, so that these constraints can be made more flex-ible. We will also study new constraints that are not considered in classic EER models. We use the fuzzy quantifiers which have been widely studied {{in the context of}} fuzzy sets and fuzzy query systems for databases. In addition, we shall examine the repre-sentation of these constraints in an EER model and their prac-tical repercussions. The following constraints are studied: the fuzzy participation constraint, the fuzzy cardinality constraint, the fuzzy completeness constraint to represent classes and subclasses, the fuzzy cardinality constraint on overlapping specializations, fuzzy disjoint and fuzzy overlapping constraints on specializations, fuzzy attribute-defined specializations, <b>fuzzy</b> constraints in <b>union</b> types or categories and fuzzy constraints in shared subclasses. We shall also demonstrate how fuzzy (min, max) notation can substitute the fuzzy cardinality constraint but not the fuzzy participation con-straint. All these fuzzy constraints have a new meaning, they offer greater expressiveness in conceptual design, and are included in the so-called fuzzy EER model.
