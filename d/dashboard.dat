50|$|<b>Dashboards</b> can {{be broken}} down {{according}} to role and are either strategic, analytical, operational, or informational. Strategic <b>dashboards</b> support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. <b>Dashboards</b> of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic <b>dashboards</b> benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. <b>Dashboards</b> for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical <b>dashboards</b> typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. <b>Dashboards</b> for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.|$|R

5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's <b>dashboard</b> through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper <b>dashboard</b> portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} user {{interface}} {{is known to}} influence the users’ attention while they are interacting with applications such as Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) <b>dashboards.</b> BI&A <b>dashboards</b> are considered as critical because they contain a lot of compressed information and managers only {{spend a little time}} to process the provided information. Thereby, they need to manage their visual attention properly due to inattentional blindness and change blindness issues. We propose to investigate the design of BI&A <b>dashboards</b> that are sensitive to the users’ attention. So called attention-aware BI&A <b>dashboards</b> are of utmost importance in the field of BI&A systems since attention is known {{to play a major role}} in constructing decisions.

5|$|End of Watch {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in South Central Los Angeles, primarily {{in the area of}} the LAPD's Newton Division, one of the most violent and gang-affiliated areas of the city. Filming took place over 22 days in August 2011, with a budget of $7.5 million. The film was shot in a combination of found footage style and traditional photography. Most scenes were captured by four cameras simultaneously: these included a handheld camera operated by Gyllenhaal, cameras clipped to Gyllenhaal and Peña's vests, and <b>dashboard</b> footage from their patrol car. Some scenes were shot entirely by Gyllenhaal. An alternate ending of the film was shot where both of the main characters died, but Ayer ultimately chose to retain the original ending.|$|E
