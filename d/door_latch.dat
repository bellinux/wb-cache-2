Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, in 1991, an {{incident}} occurred at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport involving the malfunction of a United Airlines Boeing 747 cargo door. At the time, United Airlines' maintenance staff were investigating {{the cause of}} a circuit breaker trip. In the process of diagnosing the cause, an inadvertent operation of the electric <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> mechanism caused the cargo door to open spontaneously despite being closed. [...] An inspection of the door's electrical wiring discovered insulation breaches, and isolating certain electrical wires allowed the door to operate normally again. [...] The lock sectors, latch cams, and latch pins on the door were inspected, and did not show signs of damage of the type predicted by the NTSB's original hypothesis.|$|E

60|$|Frank had {{not noticed}} it, but he had already {{discovered}} that in some matters his companion's eyes were sharper than his own. He, however, made no comment, for a heavy weariness had seized him at last and {{he was glad to}} get his clothes off and go to bed. He was soon asleep and some hours had passed when he felt Harry's hand upon his shoulder. Raising himself suddenly, he looked around. The room was very dark, and he could hear nothing until a <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> clicked below and he fancied that he heard stealthy footsteps outside the building.|$|E
60|$|In the {{background}} {{among the trees}} were ranges of stables and kennels, and on the grass-plat {{in front of the}} windows was a row of beehives. A tame doe lay on the little green sward, not far from a large rough deer-hound, both close friends who could be trusted at large. There was a mournful dispirited look about the hound, evidently an aged animal, for the once black muzzle was touched with grey, and there was a film over one of the keen beautiful eyes, which opened eagerly as he pricked his ears and lifted his head at the rattle of the <b>door</b> <b>latch.</b> Then, as two boys came out, he rose, and with a slowly waving tail, and a wistful appealing air, came and laid his head against one of the pair who had appeared in the porch. They were lads of fourteen and fifteen, clad in suits of new mourning, with the short belted doublet, puffed hose, small ruffs and little round caps of early Tudor times. They had dark eyes and hair, and honest open faces, the younger ruddy and sunburnt, the elder thinner and more intellectual--and they were so much the same size that the advantage of age was always supposed to be on the side of Stephen, though he was really the junior by nearly a year. Both were sad and grave, and the eyes and cheeks of Stephen showed traces of recent floods of tears, though there was more settled dejection on the countenance of his brother.|$|E
