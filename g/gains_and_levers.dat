40|$|AbstractIn this work, we have numerically {{simulated}} a two section, six Quantum Well {{laser diode}} by solving the rate equations. Static and modulation characteristics are studied for gain lever laser diode with longer section to shorter section ratio of 90 : 10. AM efficiency enhancement (<b>Gain</b> <b>Lever)</b> <b>and</b> Second harmonic distortion are calculated for 900 MHz RF signal at different bias currents. Third order intermodulation distortion is calculated by modulating the laser diode with two tones at 890 MHz and 910 MHz frequencies. All {{these results are}} compared with single section laser diode and performance is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite many {{strategies}} {{employed to}} improve hand hygiene, compliance remains low at around 50 %. Two reasons {{have been identified}} for this. First, implementation strategies are rarely tailored according to assessed barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to best practice. Secondly {{there is a lack}} of explicit theoretical basis for the assessment of these barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to practice. Aim: This paper reports barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene and an evaluation of the use of theory in assessing barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene. Methods: Identification of barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> occurred through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. In each case two different question schedules were used, one based on psychological theory and the other with no explicit theoretical underpinning. Results: Although there was considerable overlap in the barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> identified using the two schedules there were also marked differences. Conclusions: Identification of further barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> may help us address lack of compliance with hand hygiene. Using a theoretical framework may prompt the identification of barriers that people may not ordinarily report but which have an important impact on behaviour, particularly emotion...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{example of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{used for this}} research was hand hygiene. The aim of this research was: to develop and test a theory-based diagnostic instrument to accurately and prospectively assess the barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene practice to inform subsequent tailoring of implementation strategies. Study One: A qualitative study was carried out with health care practitioners (n= 70) and recent hospital patients (n= 25) to identify barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene in secondary care. A thematic analysis resulted in a list of 100 barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene. Study Two: A two round modified Delphi survey was administered to assess the fit of barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene to domains of the British Psychological Society theoretical framework. Expert participants were recruited from the fields of Infection Prevention and Control (n=l 1) and Health Psychology (n= 10). Consensus was achieved on the fit of 99 of 100 barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to the framework. Study Three: Studies one and two informed {{the construction of a}} questionnaire-style diagnostic instrument designed to identify barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene. Health care practitioners (a total of 470) from four NHS hospital trusts completed questionnaires in three rounds which allowed the instrument to be refined using psychometric testing principles. The result was a 35 item instrument demonstrating good levels of reliability and validity. Study Four: The instrument was used to carry out a feasibility study to assess whether theoretically based interventions could be tailored according to assessed barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene and to establish the potential effectiveness of such an approach. Barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene were assessed with 19 junior doctors in an NHS hospital trust. It was identified that such an approach was feasible and hand hygiene audits indicated the potential effectiveness of such an approach. Conclusion: The literature suggests that implementation strategies need to be theoretically based and tailored to assessed barriers <b>and</b> <b>levers</b> to hand hygiene. This study took a step forward in addressing these findings using the example of hand hygiene. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
