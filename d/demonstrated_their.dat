The growing Imperial strength made attacks on the Suez Canal difficult, and ended the dominance of the Ottoman force in the area. The Ottoman Empire's attacks on 23 April <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> intention to continue opposing the British Empire in the region.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland. He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, Craig was made captain for Australia's Test tour to South Africa, making him the {{youngest}} captain in Test history at the age of 22years and 194days, with Harvey as his deputy. The appointment came despite his mixed batting form during the New Zealand tour. The selectors further <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> view to the future when they dropped veteran Ray Lindwall altogether. The average age of Craig's team was {{two and a half years}} younger than the Australian squad sent to England in 1956, and they had only one player over the age of 30, whereas the 1956 team had five members over the age of 30. As a result of the team's relative inexperience, they were judged by critics to be the worst to have left Australian shores. Craig joined his team in Johannesburg after flying in from London, where he had been working for six months as a pharmacist, with the approval of the Australian board.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{dominated}} the ice hockey competition, winning every match {{to take their}} sixth Olympic gold in eight Winter Games. East German sledders fully <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> prowess at the Trebević track. Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer clinched gold in both bobsleigh events, while Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musiol secured both silvers. Led by Steffi Martin, who won the first of her two back-to-back Olympic titles, East German lugers swept the women's singles medals. This show of strength was also observed in the women's speed skating, where East German athletes grabbed nine of the twelve medals in dispute. Four of these were won by Karin Enke (matching the total tallies of Hämäläinen and Svan), and three by Andrea Schöne – in direct competition with Enke. Speed skater Gaétan Boucher won three of Canada's four medals in Sarajevo, including two golds.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was gradually}} modernised {{in the decades}} following the Second World War, including newer main artillery {{for some of the}} forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the Cold War gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications. Weapons such as cruise missiles and smart bombs made large static fortifications such as Boden Fortress obsolete when they <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> worth during the Gulf War in 1991. Mjösjöberget Fort had been decommissioned and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979, and less than ten years after the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the four other forts followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on 31 December 1997, and exactly one year later, on 31 December 1998, that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.|$|E

5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued to be thought of as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} Kenyan runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (also her debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the Kenyan women's team, which was considered {{the team to beat}} for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which had brought them team medals in the last five editions) <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E
5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E

5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann {{opened his}} review by calling Burnout 3: Takedown {{one of the}} best racing games of all time, noting that it stood out among contemporaries in the diverse and {{expanding}} genre. He felt the quality of the game was high enough to recommend it to gamers who were impartial to driving games. Edge magazine regarded Burnout 3 to be Criterion's finest work to date; they thought the studio had <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> proficiency by revising the series structure and dynamic. They were also mindful of how Burnout 3s offered a fun and exhilarating experience while other developers were prioritising realism in their games. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the addition of significant gameplay mechanics had helped craft one of the most addictive racing games ever made. GamesTM awarded it a perfect score; they proclaimed that Burnout 3 was without a doubt the greatest racing game ever made and described playing it as the most fun they had ever had in the genre. GameSpy reviewer Miguel Lopez, who also awarded the game a perfect score, remarked that it was possibly the best arcade racer ever made.|$|E
5|$|In the 1938–39 season, O’Reilly removed Hassett {{twice in}} three innings in matches {{between the two}} states. Their rivalry culminated in two {{encounters}} on the SCG {{at the conclusion of}} the 1939–40 season. The first, between Victoria and NSW, effectively decided the winner of the Sheffield Shield; Victoria had won the first match between the two teams for the season. By scoring 122 in both innings, Hassett became the only player to score two centuries in a match against a team containing O'Reilly. Nevertheless, NSW won the game and the shield, before playing against a Rest of Australia combination. Batting for the Rest of Australia, Hassett almost repeated his feat by making 136 and 75, but this was not enough to stop NSW, who <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> strength with another victory. Hassett had scored five half-centuries in the five preceding matches of the season, including three in four innings against Grimmett’s South Australia, and ended the Australian summer with 897 runs at 74.75. He lost his wicket to O'Reilly in a first-class match only three times.|$|E

5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of the Copa Libertadores took place in 1960. Seven teams participated: Bahia of Brazil, Jorge Wilstermann of Bolivia, Millonarios of Colombia, Olimpia of Paraguay, Peñarol of Uruguay, San Lorenzo of Argentina and Universidad de Chile. All these teams were {{domestic}} champions of their respective leagues in 1959. The first Copa Libertadores match took place on April 19, 1960. It was won by Peñarol, who defeated Jorge Wilstermann 7–1. The first goal in Copa Libertadores history was scored by Carlos Borges of Peñarol. The Uruguayans won the first ever edition, defeating Olimpia in the finals, and successfully defended the title in 1961. The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition, when the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé, considered by some the best club team of all time, earned worldwide admiration. Os Santásticos, also known as O Balé Branco (the white ballet) won the title in 1962 defeating defending champions Peñarol in the finals. A year later, O Rei and his compatriot Coutinho <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> skills again {{in the form of}} tricks, dribbles, backheels, and goals including two in the second leg of the final at La Bombonera, to subdue Boca Juniors 2–1 and retain the trophy.|$|E
5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures, future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral <b>demonstrated</b> <b>their</b> advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E
