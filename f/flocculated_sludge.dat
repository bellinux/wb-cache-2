40|$|Flocculation using {{titanium}} tetrachloride (TiCl 4) as a coagulant is an efficient and economical application because the <b>flocculated</b> <b>sludge</b> can be recycled {{to produce a}} valuable byproduct, namely titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles. However, toxicity of TiCl 4 {{has not yet been}} assessed while it is used in water treatment. The aquatic toxicity of TiCl 4 flocculation process was investigated to assess the environmental safety of the coagulant. D. magna and V. fischeri bioassays were carried out to evaluate the supernatant toxicity after TiCl 4 flocculation. Artificial wastewater, biologically treated sewage effluent, and seawater were used to study the toxicity of TiCl 4 flocculation. Results showed that supernatant toxicity was very low when TiCl 4 flocculation was conducted (no observed effect concentration = 100 mg/L and lowest observed effect concentration = 150 mg/L exposed to D. magna and V. fischeri, respectively). Similarly, TiO 2 nanoparticles recovered from wastewater and seawater <b>flocculated</b> <b>sludge</b> were also found to have low toxicity. The regenerated TiO 2 nanoparticles indicated low toxicity values when compared to the commercial-TiO 2 nanoparticle, P- 25 close 242...|$|E

No significant change was observed in sludge granule size when operational pH was changed from 7 to 8. The 208 -day continuous operation of the SBR showed that sludge granules were stably maintained with a sludge volume index (SVI) between 30 to 55 mL/g while securing a removal efficiency of 83 % for carbon and 97 % for phosphorus.

A new mobile phase, which does not display binding properties for multivalent cations, was previously optimized. This mobile phase contained 75 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7 with 15 % acetonitrile (v/v) and was selected to minimize ionic and hydrophobic interactions between the molecules {{that make up the}} EPS and the column packing. When EPS extracted from similar sludges is analyzed using different mobile phases, the number of chromatographic peaks obtained is quite similar, and differences are mainly observed in the relative absorbance of the chromatographic peaks. However, very different chromatograms (number and relative absorbance of chromatographic peaks) are obtained for EPS extracted from different types of sludges. Furthermore, when dysfunctions, such as filamentous bulking in the activated sludge, occur in a bioreactor, they also induce strong variations in chromatographic profiles...|$|E

Among others, there are significant problems in extracting PAMs from soil or sludge matrixes for quantification by conventional methods due {{to the degree of}} sorption of the polymer. Thus, the use of a radioactive polymer was the only option to follow the fate of PAMs. We mimicked the land-spreading of sludge using 14 C-PAM to <b>flocculate</b> <b>sludge,</b> which was then applied to the lysimeter.

40|$|Activated sludge {{process in}} {{wastewater}} treatment plant (WWTP) produces large amount of excess sludge. The disposal of sludge in Netherlands is costly (500 EUR/ton wet solids), and therefore reduction techniques of digested sludge are {{of great interest to}} improve the costs of wastewater treatment. First part of this study focused on one of the biological approaches to reduce the excess sludge that can be achieved by aquatic worms in short period of time. Worms are efficient degraders to extra mineralization of sludge into biomass, water and CO 2. In optimal condition the total biomass production is low. The investigation on worm predation shows high concentration of ammonia in sludge is toxic and it inhibits the growth of worms, so flocculation was done to separate ammonia from solid. The hypothesis is that <b>flocculated</b> digested <b>sludge</b> (FDS) can be degraded by aquatic worms. In this study, we evaluated the degradation rate, temperature effect, ammonia concentration and worm growth rate. The obtained results from worm experiment showed, in long test (12 days), with the worm biomass of (21. 2 g/ww), the degradation of sludge in worm reactor is (15. 75 %), while it is (6. 65 %) in aerated reactor.

40|$|This study investigates {{microbial}} population dynamics in granular sequencing batch reactors (GSBR). The experimental results of DGGE fingerprint of sludge {{demonstrated that the}} microbial community structure of sludge shifted significantly during granulation period and nutrient removal improvement period. After reactor performance and physical characteristics of sludge reached steady state, {{microbial population}} of sludge became relatively stable. The high similarity of microbial community structure between co-existed <b>flocculated</b> <b>sludge</b> and granular sludge in GSBR at different operation phases indicated that similar microbial consortium could exist in compact aggregated form or in amorphous flocculated form. Therefore, strong selection pressure was still required to wash out flocs to maintain the stability of reactor operation. In addition, {{it was found that}} substrate type had considerable impact on microbial species selection and enrichment in granular sludge. The clone library of granular sludge showed that microbial species in divisions of alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes existed within acetate-fed granule communities and Thauera spp. from beta-Proteobacteria accounted for 49 % of the total clones in the whole clone library. It is thus speculated that Thauera spp. are important for the formation of acetate-fed granules under the conditions used in this study, maintaining the integrity of granules or substrate degradation.

Electrodeposition is effective in recover heavy metals from wastewater streams. It is considered as an established technology with possible further development in the improvement of space-time yield. EC has been in use for water production or wastewater treatment. It is finding more applications using either aluminum, iron or the hybrid Al/Fe electrodes.

40|$|Strategies for {{sampling}} sediment bacteria {{were examined}} in intensive shrimp, Penaeus monodon (Fabricius), ponds in tropical Australia. Stratified sampling of bacteria {{at the end of}} the production season showed that the pond centre, containing <b>flocculated</b> <b>sludge,</b> had significantly higher bacterial counts (15. 5 X 10 (9) g(- 1) dw) than the pond periphery (8. 1 X 10 (9) g(- 1) dw), where the action of aerators had swept the pond floor. The variation in bacterial counts between these two zones within a pond was higher than that between sites within each zone or between ponds. Therefore, sampling effort should be focused within these zones: for example, sampling two ponds at six locations within each of the two zones resulted in a coefficient of variation of approximate to 5 %. Bacterial numbers in the sediment were highly correlated with sediment grain size, probably because eroded soil particles and organic waste both accumulated in the centre of the pond. Despite high inputs of organic matter added to the ponds, principally as pelleted feeds, the mean bacterial numbers and nutrient concentrations (i. e. organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) in the sediment were similar to those found in mangrove sediments. This suggests that bacteria are rapidly remineralizing particulates into soluble compounds. Bacterial numbers were highly correlated with organic carbon and total kjeldahl nitrogen in the sediment, suggesting that these were limiting factors to bacterial growth...|$|E
40|$|A multi-method {{protocol}} previously {{proposed for}} the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from <b>flocculated</b> <b>sludges</b> was investigated on dense aerobic granules. The protocol combines mechanical disruption by sonication and chemical extraction using the Tween detergent and the cation chelator, EDTA. Polysaccharides were mainly recovered during the first sonication step while proteins were recovered all along the extractive procedure with a high prevalence in the EDTA step. These data confirmed {{the interest of the}} multi-method protocol for harvesting a diversified pool of EPS from dense granules and for fractionation of the polymers according to their physicochemical properties. In addition, the high extractability of proteins with EDTA confers a specific behavior of the aerobic granules towards the multi-method extraction protocol, supporting the idea that proteins are associated in the granule matrix through ionic interactions involving divalent cations. Analysis of the extracted EPS by anionic exchange chromatography confirmed the presence of highly anionic proteins that were specifically detected in the extracts obtained from granules. One important question is now to investigate whether these highly anionic proteins are involved in the aggregation and densification process and if their presence is related to the cohesive properties of these particles...|$|R

In a petroleum refinery, removing of hydrocarbons is the main concern and nitrogen content is supposed to be negligible. The aim of this work was to search for nitrogen in Tehran Refinery wastewater and employing a biological technology to reduce this pollutant. Samplings were done in different points of wastewater treatment plant; influent to aeration unit, effluent of aeration unit and effluent of clarifiers. The results showed that despite of a high average removal efficiency of COD> 93 %, the nitrogen removal during conventional activated sludge process was not efficient and sludge rising due to denitrification was observed within the clarifier. The analysis conducted in laboratory scale showed that a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process could easily be realized in the same activated sludge plant by using the <b>flocculating</b> <b>sludge</b> and control of dissolved oxygen concentration.

40|$|In this study, an {{original}} method of characterization of water/solid matter interactions in sewage sludge has been developed, based on both rheological characteristics and thermodynamic water activity determinations, {{in order to}} check whether a link could be made with water activity and its mechanical properties. The effect of solid matter content, flocculation and ageing time on water activity and rheological parameters has been investigated. Through this study, we showed that rheological parameters (G’ and G’’) of both raw and <b>flocculated</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> at optimal dose of polymer increase with solids concentration following a power-law, whereas {{in the same way}} water activity decreases following an exponential relationship (Arrhenius dependence). A slight increase of water activity values and those of G’ and G’’ moduli with added polymer was also highlighted.

Rheological parameters clearly evidenced thermodynamic water activity dependence, regarding solid concentration and ageing time, with a decrease of G’ and G’’ upon increasing water activity. Thus, water/solid matter interactions were supposed to intervene importantly in the rheology of sewage sludge.

The selected flocculant was a cationic organic polyelectrolyte, based on polyacrylamide: the PRAESTOL K 233 L by Stockhausen GmbH. A 15 litres stirred reactor was fed once a day with <b>flocculated</b> activated <b>sludge</b> originated from a large full-scale wastewater treatment plant. After a first trial (reference period), where only activated sludge fed the reactor, the activated sludge was then conditioned with increasing amounts of the cationic polymer dosed at 5, 15 and 30 g per kg of sludge (dry weight). The performances of the reactor were then studied in terms of biogas production, volatile matter removal and parameters indicating the process stability (pH, alkalinity, biogas composition). These were compared to the results obtained in the reference period. The digester worked in the mesophilic range of temperature (35 – 37 °C) with a hydraulic retention time of 20 days and an organic loading rate of some 1 kgVS/m 3 reactor per day. These were chosen as typical operational conditions for anaerobic digesters working with waste activated sludge. The experimental set up enabled to observe that the addition of the cationic flocculant did not affect the digester performances in terms of biogas production, the specific biogas production was 0. 15 – 0. 23 l/gVSfed in all the tested conditions, and that the flocculant was partially biodegradable. Also kinetic studies confirmed this situation and a value of the first order reaction kinetic constant, K, equal to some 0. 10 day- 1 was observed, no matter the flocculant concentration. On the other hand, the presence of the typical functional groups of the flocculant was observed in the digester supernatants by spectro-photometric analysis.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} {{wastewater treatment}} plants need a large surface area {{for the treatment of}} their sewage. This is due to the open structure of the biomass used to convert the polluting components in wastewater. Because of the <b>flocculated</b> growth, <b>sludge</b> concentrations in reaction tanks are low and settling times need to be long {{in order to keep the}} biomass in the system. This Ph. D. thesis describes the development of a new compact aerobic granular sludge technology, in which the biomass is grown in compact granular structures. The main advantage of this compact growth structure is the higher biomass concentrations that van be reached and that all processes, needed for the treatment of wastewater, can be performed in one (discontinuously operated) reactor. Therefore, 80 % less area and 30 % less energy is required for the treatment of the wastewater. This process is unique, since by the natural composition of the aerobic granular sludge, combined with different diffusion limitations, all processes for the conversion of the polluting agents can occur in the same granule simultaneously. In the laboratory, biological removal efficiencies of 100 % COD (acetate), 94 % phosphate and 94 % nitrogen (of which full-nitrification) were measured. During the Ph. D. a large-scale design has been made by the engineers of the Dutch consultancy firm DHV. Bottlenecks from practice were translated to scientific research and the results of the research could directly be used in the design. Different bottlenecks that were studied in the laboratory scale research were the influence on conversions and granule morphology of i) the way of influent dosing, ii) the use of a bubble column or airlift (influence of high local shear forces), iii) influence of temperature, iv) type of wastewater. A model for aerobic granular sludge has been developed as well, in order to study the sensitivity of different process parameters on conversion rates and efficiencies. This fast procedure for developing innovations led to a successful pilot scale study at sewage treatment plant Ede, The Netherlands and to the market introduction of this new technology by DHV under the name of NeredaTM.

40|$|Since {{the usage}} of {{chemical}} flocculants especially polyacrylamides is closely related with environmental pollution and health hazards, synthesis of environmental friendly and economic viable bio-flocculants that exhibit high flocculating efficiency is highly desirable. The production of natural bio-flocculants extracted from plant is urgently needed {{as an alternative to}} chemical flocculants due to their inherent low toxicity, biodegradability and low environmental footprint. In this study, a plant-based bio-flocculant was extracted from Hibiscus/Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) with conventional hydrothermal extraction (CHE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) processes by using water as solvent. The aims of this work were to produce the bio-flocculant through environmentally friendly and economically feasible process, optimise its extraction yield, optimise its <b>flocculating</b> and <b>sludge</b> dewatering properties, and also minimise its production cost in order to be comparable to chemical flocculants (polyacrylamides) from perspectives of quality and cost. The extraction efficiencies of bio-flocculants were justified by the optimised yields, the flocculating abilities were evaluated by the removal of suspended solids (SS) and turbidity after flocculation process and sludge volume index (SVI) whereas the sludge dewatering abilities were assessed by SS removal after filtration and water recovery. Single factor experimental design was employed to study the effects of extraction temperature, time, solvent loading, and agitation speed and particle size on yield, flocculating and dewatering properties of bio-flocculants. The influence of extraction parameters to yield and the reliability of the experimental data were verified by analysing the single factor experimental results with response surface methodology. Results showed that extraction yields were significantly affected by extraction temperature and time and solvent loading. Prolonged extraction (few hours) at high temperature (60 - 90 ˚C) decreased the yields of bio-flocculants extracted with CHE method. Conversely, extraction at high temperature was favourable for MAE method to raise the yield due to short extraction time in minutes. Flocculating abilities of bio-flocculants were not significantly affected by the extraction conditions whilst the sludge dewatering abilities were mainly influenced by the temperature and particle size.

Despite the importance of activated sludge flocs to human civilization there have been precious few attempts to rationally design fit for purpose flocs using a bottom-up approach based on a solid scientific foundation.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on activated sludge (AS) to investigate {{the correlations between the}} content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the performance of biosolids-water separation, including sludge flocculation, sedimentation, compression, and dewatering, under non-steady-state conditions. On three stabilized AS reactors changes were made in sludge retention time (SRT), substrate composition, and loading rate, respectively, to bring about unstable operation to the reactors. A two-step heating method was used to extract from the sludge the easily extractable EPS, or loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS), and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), respectively. The experimental results demonstrate dynamic changes in sludge characteristic and EPS production under the non-steady-state conditions. During the early phase of transition after a change was imposed, the sludge became generally worse in flocculation, compressibility, and dewaterability. With the acclimatization of the biomass to the new process conditions, biosolids-water separation showed a general trend of improvement. Changes in AS process condition also resulted in considerable variations in EPS production. The change of the LB-EPS content appeared to be more significant than that of the TB-EPS. Throughout the non-steady-state operation, the <b>sludge</b> <b>flocculating</b> behavior, settleability, compressibility, and dewaterability had a positive correlation with the LB-EPS content; however, no correlation could be found between these properties and the TB-EPS content. The results suggest that although EPS is essential to biofloc formation, excessive EPS in the form of LB-EPS would weaken cell attachment and deteriorate the AS floc structure, resulting in poor biosolids-water separation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
