500|$|The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as {{they speak}} via telephone. He begins, [...] "All I want <b>is</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> you love me?" [...] She affirms, and {{he asks for}} another chance. The video {{transitions}} to Swift sitting {{on the living room}} floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch at a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will you give me another chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her sitting beside the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E

He'll go and take some one else and then you'll be fit to break your heart, fretting after him, and I shan't pity you a bit.
