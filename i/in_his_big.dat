5|$|After the World Cup England {{lost the}} annual Home Championship to Scotland after a 3–2 defeat in April 1967, Charlton scored {{for the second}} {{successive}} international game running after also finding the net against Wales the previous November. He injured his foot during the game as he broke two sesamoid bones <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>big</b> toe. As his career went on he began to miss England games with niggling injuries {{so as to avoid}} friendly games in favour of playing important matches for Leeds; Brian Labone would take his place in the England team during Charlton's absences. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not feature in either of England's games. He won five caps in 1969, helping England to a memorable 5–0 win over France and scoring in a 1–0 win over Portugal from a corner taken by his brother Bobby.|$|E

Rival teams are developing such chambers, at Solarec and at Sandia National Laboratories, both based in New Mexico. According to Sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100% of domestic vehicles using 5800km2; unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used for anything else.
