60|$|Last but not least, I {{come to my}} {{excellent}} friend Mr. Jones. It {{would be}} difficult to say whether I was his right-hand man, or he mine, during the voyage. Thus at table I carved, while he only scooped gravy; but at our concerts, of which more anon, he was the president who called up performers to sing, and I but his messenger who ran his errands and pleaded privately with the over-modest. I knew I liked Mr. Jones from the moment I saw him. I thought him by his face to be Scottish; nor could his accent undeceive me. For as there is a lingua franca of many tongues on the moles and in the feluccas of the Mediterranean, so there is a free or common accent among English-speaking men who follow the sea. They catch a twang in a New England Port; from a cockney skipper, even a Scotsman sometimes learns to drop an h; a word of a dialect is picked up from another band in the forecastle; until often the result is undecipherable, and you have to ask for the manâ€™s place of birth. So it was with Mr. Jones. I thought him a Scotsman who had been long to sea; and yet he was from Wales, and had been most of his life a blacksmith at an inland forge; a few years in America and half a score of ocean voyages having sufficed to modify his speech into the common pattern. By his own account he was both strong and skilful in his trade. A few years back, he had been married and after a fashion a rich man; now the wife was dead and the money gone. But his was the nature that looks forward, and goes on from one year to another and through all the extremities of fortune undismayed; and if the sky were to fall to-morrow, I should look to see Jones, the day following, perched on a step-ladder and getting things to rights. He was always hovering round inventions like a bee over a flower, and lived in a dream of patents. He had with him a patent medicine, for instance, the composition of which he had bought years ago for five dollars from an American pedlar, and sold the other day for a hundred pounds (I think it was) to an English apothecary. It was called Golden Oil, cured all maladies without exception; and I am bound to say that I partook of it myself with good results. It is a character of the man that he was not only perpetually dosing himself with Golden Oil, but wherever there was a head aching or a <b>finger</b> <b>cut,</b> there would be Jones with his bottle.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} set in the time of the {{historical}} King Hintsa kaKhawuta (1789-1835), and concerns a dispute between the fictional twins Wele and Babini over their deceased fatherâ€™s estate. As they are born on the same day, there is a dispute as to who should take their fatherâ€™s place. This is resolved via a traditional Xhosa legal trial, held at the court of King Hintsa, who presides over the trial. Various people give testimony, key among them Khulile, an inyange (a wise, old sage) and thus a vital source of oral tradition, and the midwives who helped at the twinsâ€™ birth. The story also concerns the Xhosa tradition of ingqithi, â€˜finger cuttingâ€™, whereby a child has his or her <b>finger</b> <b>cut.</b> A midwife, Teyase, is able to verify who is the first born by virtue of the cut finger (only one twin had his <b>finger</b> <b>cut,</b> the second born). Khulile notes that the reason the first-born is usually given priority and made his fatherâ€™s successor is that he has more experience than his younger brothers, but {{that in the case of}} twins this argument does not really stand. By the end of the trial, both brothers are humbled and each proclaims the seniority of the other.|$|E
