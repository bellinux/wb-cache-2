2500|$|Economic studies {{conducted}} for the grocery <b>industry</b> <b>committee</b> projected over $40 million in savings to the industry from scanning by the mid-1970s. Those numbers were not achieved in that time-frame and some predicted the demise of barcode scanning.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an <b>industry</b> <b>committee</b> on standardization, {{developed}} {{a system of}} designating spectral responses. The philosophy included {{the idea that the}} product's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned [...] "S-numbers" [...] (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called [...] "multialkali" [...] photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or sodium-potassium-antimony-caesium) that provides extended response in the red portion of the visible light spectrum. No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.|$|E
