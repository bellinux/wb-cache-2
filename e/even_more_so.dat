5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} many unknown factors. The {{properties}} of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown; <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> those of plutonium, a chemical element that {{had only recently}} been discovered by Glenn Seaborg and his team in February 1941, but which was theoretically fissile. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned breeding plutonium in nuclear reactors from uranium-238 atoms that absorbed neutrons from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only microscopic quantities of plutonium were available that had been produced by cyclotrons.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of}} a boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E

5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so.</b> Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{was granted}} to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a {{separate}} unit within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, {{the governor of}} Idumea, {{was in charge of}} the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria. After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province of Syria. In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the arms and hands of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> than that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E
50|$|A {{cancellation}} typically follows after a civil divorce {{when a woman}} {{seeks to}} be sealed to another man.

50|$|Theoretical {{knowledge}} is essential, but practice and practical knowledge are <b>even</b> <b>more</b> essential. <b>So,</b> students {{get the chance}} to work in every part of the school farm: the cow shed, the forestry shop, the metal and wood workshops, and also in the butchery. The other part of practical education takes place in the laboratory, where students analyze soil, feed, water and many other substances.|$|R

5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{region of}} France {{is well known}} for its horse breeding, having also {{produced}} the Percheron and French Trotter. Small horses called bidets were the original horses in the area, and these, crossed with other types, eventually produced the Carrossier Normand, the immediate ancestor of the Norman Cob. Although {{known as one of the}} best carriage horse breeds available in the early 20th century, the Carrossier Normand became extinct after the advent of the automobile, having been used to develop the French Trotter, Anglo-Norman and Norman Cob. In its homeland, the Norman Cob was used widely for agriculture, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> than the internationally known Percheron, and in 1950, the first studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. In {{the first place}} there was {{a shift in the}} product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products; livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting <b>even</b> <b>more</b> difficult, <b>so</b> this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question.|$|R

Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> than the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|In Baxter's eyes, {{the main}} {{role of the}} {{university}} was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was {{far short of the}} university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{acquisitions}} {{have become increasingly}} difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period {{would have been impossible}} without the major public appeals backing them, including The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist by Leonardo da Vinci (bought in 1962) and Titian’s Death of Actaeon (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid Schengen Area visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as they are already inside the Schengen Area). Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E
