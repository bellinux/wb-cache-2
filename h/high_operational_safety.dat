40|$|The {{need for}} the {{transformation}} of the financial institutions during the current crisis requires that new approaches for ensuring stability and efficiency of the financial system are sought and implemented. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the need for enhanced transformation of supervision and regulation of the EU banking system, as well as show the possibility of achieving a decisive efficiency and stability through the introduction of concepts related to the network approach and the treatment the system as a critical infrastructure. Drawing on means related to the construction of <b>high</b> <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> systems, the paper outlines ways to transform the financial (banking) system, from a structure with subsequent (delayed) regulation and management into an operational self-regulating system (system of systems) operating in near real-time. This transformation would presumably allow for a sharp increase in the system’s stability and operability. The prerequisites for achieving networkcentric supervision and regulation in transforming the EU banking system are discussedfinancial system, network, transformation, critical infrastructure, supervisio...|$|E
30|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{have attracted}} much attention as important energy supply in portable electronic devices, hybrid electrical vehicles and electrical vehicles because of their high power and energy density [1, 2, 3]. At present, new electrode materials exhibiting excellent rate capability and high safety performance are urgently demanded to meet the requirement of electrical vehicles. The spinel lithium titanate Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is being considered as an ideal anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its unique characteristics, including very flat charge/discharge voltage plateaus and a small structural change during charge/discharge processes. The zero-strain insertion characteristic provides material with an excellent cycling performance [4, 5], while that of the flat operating voltage at 1.55  V (versus Li+/Li) can avoid the deposition of dendritic metallic lithium, therefore a <b>high</b> <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> can be expected [6, 7]. Despite the high Li deintercalation/intercalation potential, it can, in principle, be coupled with high-voltage cathodes such as LiNi 0.4 Mn 1.6 O 4 to provide a cell with an operating voltage of approximately 3  V [8].|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{computer}} interfaces in transportation {{command and control}} centres is vital to safe and smooth operations. Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{is probably the most}} dynamic area in transportation where a large amount of information is presented to the air traffic controller within a short timeframe. Future Air Traffic Interfaces (ATI) are on the horizon with more information and added levels of sophistication. Safety is becoming a default constraint in current systems and evaluating the usability of these interfaces has been seen traditionally as crucial for ensuring <b>high</b> <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> standards. To this end, a strong business case for evaluating the usability of interfaces necessarily requires a full-scale justification of the usability study and its associated cost. The benefits of performing such an evaluation also need to be communicated to decision makers in terms of economic values and gains. It is at this point that the field of operational analysis intersects with human factor research. This paper outlines a methodology for conducting usability studies for ATI. The methodology has been designed to connect higher-level organisational objectives with low-level usability metrics. The methodology will be presented towards establishing a code of best practice for the design and conduct of usability studies in this domain. While the results can be generalised to other transportation command and control interfaces, this paper focuses on ATC because this code of best practice is tailored towards ATC functions. 1...|$|E

40|$|Presently Sjöfartsverket {{do their}} {{maintenance}} {{according to a}} standard program, which means that every maintenance task will be done when the task limit occurs. This leads to a very long downtime for the aircraft in some occasions and very short downtime in others. The goal with this work is to reach a higher regularity of the aircraft operation. To reach a higher regularity for the operational needs, this work will present a hypothetic better maintenance concept for Swedish Maritime Administration. The concept is based on equalized maintenance structure, which means that every maintenance occasions are meant to take {{the same time to}} perform. This result will lead to easier planning and better maintenance overview of the aircraft operation. Different types of results have been presented {{depending on the size of}} the check cycle or if the engineering unit at the helicopter organization is going to use a reliability program in the future or not. Two with different types of check cycles and one, which can be considered as a future goal when a potential reliability program is in use.     The work of the equalized maintenance structure takes airworthiness limitation tasks in consideration and put them as “drop outs” besides the check cycle itself because of the high criticality in those items. Excel has been used to store and sort all the maintenance tasks, which are considered in this work, and pivot tables have been used to get an overview of the number of tasks in each interval. An aircraft reliability program has been suggested in the future due to the changes in escalation of intervals gives Sjöfartsverket the opportunity to optimize their equalized structure even further with less reduction of task intervals, a better task spread out and <b>higher</b> <b>operational</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{operational}} {{stability of}} a complex process such as the blast furnace is under constant threat owing to variation {{in the quality of}} raw materials as well as other operating conditions. Significant cost reductions can be achieved with adequate control of this process. Hence, mathematical models have proven to be useful in the thermal control of blast furnaces with regards to the fuel consumption and operational stability of these reactors. The thermo-chemical model calculates the hourly carbon consumption, which allows the operator to adjust for the aiming quantity of carbon. A strong correlation is observed between the results of the model and the actual results from the process. Thus, the model provides conditions for the operator to anticipate carbon behavior, and thus prevent large variation in the thermal properties of the blast furnace and provide <b>high</b> levels of <b>operational</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R

These materials must withstand reactor relevant high neutron fluxes which change structure and properties of the material and radio-activate it. The impact of neutron damage on plasma-material interaction with respect to thermal and particle loads is investigated in customized linear plasma generators in a hot cell. In order to avoid emission of possibly radioactive contamination and to get stable conditioning a remote handling system including lock system for the samples was developed for the Jülich plasma generator (JULE-PSI). All mountings and operations like moving and fixing the sample are designed such that maintenance and revisions are minimized at a <b>high</b> level of <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> and availability.

40|$|The {{output and}} input {{coupling}} characteristics of the compliant parallel mechanism (CPM) bring difficulty in the motion control and challenge its <b>high</b> performance and <b>operational</b> <b>safety.</b> This paper presents a systematic design method for a 2 -degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) CPM with excellent decoupling performance. A symmetric kinematic structure can guarantee a CPM with a complete output decoupling characteristic; input coupling is reduced by resorting to a flexure-based decoupler. This work discusses the stiffness design requirement of the decoupler and proposes a compound flexure hinge as its basic structure. Analytical methods have been derived to assess the mechanical performances of the CPM in terms of input and output stiffness, motion stroke, input coupling degree, and natural frequency. The CPM’s geometric parameters were optimized to minimize the input coupling while ensuring key performance indicators at the same time. The optimized CPM’s performances were then evaluated by using a finite element analysis. Finally, a prototype was constructed and experimental validations were carried out to test {{the performance of the}} CPM and verify the effectiveness of the design method. The design procedure proposed in this paper is systematic and can be extended to design the CPMs with other types of motion...|$|R

BACKGROUND: The fundamental basis for conducting Senior Management Meetings (SMMs) is the NRC's need to assure the <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> performance of nuclear power plants. Following the Davis Besse loss-of-feedwater incident in June 1985, the agency established the SMM process to provide a forum for senior managers to assess nuclear power reactor <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> performance. This incident and two other significant operational events in 1985 [...] the San Onofre and Rancho Seco events in November and December 1985, respectively [...] underscored the need for improved methods to evaluate <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> performance. The primary goal of the SMM, {{as well as the}} other evaluative processes discussed in this paper and its attachments, is to identify declining trends in the <b>operational</b> <b>safety</b> performance of individual plants so that early corrective actions can be implemented.
