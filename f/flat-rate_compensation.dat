The thesis contains the information necessary to determine the correct value of the individual types of travel expenses. First, the principles applied {{in the provision of}} travel expenses are discussed. Then business trips and conditions of their realization are defined. The core of the thesis presents description of fare, food allowance, accommodation and necessary incidental expenses for domestic and foreign business trips. <b>Flat-rate</b> <b>compensation</b> and conditions of use are also mentioned. The issue of providing travel expenses is also considered in terms of taxes. Next part of the thesis describes using of exchange rates when travelling abroad and shows how to account advance payments and claims for travel expenses in double-entry accounting. Discussed problems are interlined with practical examples for better understanding. At the end of the thesis, a comprehensive example of calculation and charging of travel expenses is contained...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{model with}} imperfectly {{competitive}} labor and product markets the real consequences of labor market shocks for economies with either an earnings-related or <b>flat-rate</b> unemployment <b>compensation</b> system are considered. A distinctive {{feature of the}} analysis is the comparison of both unemployment compensation systems in a two-country setting. It is demonstrated that {{the performance of a}} system with earnings-related or flat-rate unemployment benefits depends on whether the labor market shock is provoked in the home country or originates from abroad. We also point out how our results extend to two-tier unemployment compensation systems which differ with respect to the relative importance of earnings-related and flat-rate benefits. ...|$|R

This study uses a Symmetric Generalised McFadden cost function to analyze the relationship between costs of production and {{the provision}} of biodiversity for Swedish milk farms. Biodiversity indicators are {{based on the number of}} valuable plant species present at the farm and are modeled as an output in the cost function. The results show that the marginal cost of biodiversity increases with higher provision, and that an increased provision of biodiversity also increases the costs of market commodities such as milk and beef. The upward slope of the marginal cost of biodiversity and its competitive relationship with market goods questions the efficiency of support schemes based on voluntary programmes with a <b>flat-rate</b> per hectare <b>compensation.</b> Instead, the results support targeted environmental policy schemes with zonings and/or the use of biodiversity indicators.
