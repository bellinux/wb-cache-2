25|$|Working with {{barbed wire}} was a nasty job under any circumstances, {{but when you}} were {{handling}} it {{in the dark and}} within a hundred yards of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move might mean death for <b>half</b> <b>your</b> party.|$|E
25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling <b>half</b> <b>your</b> work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
500|$|Field Marshal Lord Roberts {{replaced}} Buller as British Commander-in-Chief in South Africa in January 1900. [...] Within a month Roberts assembled 30,000 infantry, 7,501 cavalry and 3,600 mounted infantry, {{together with}} 120 guns, {{in the area}} between the Orange and Modder Rivers. [...] The largest British mounted division ever assembled was created {{under the command of}} Major-General John French through the amalgamation of virtually all the cavalry in the area. [...] News of the shelling by the Boer Long Tom gun had reached Lord Roberts, whose parting words to his officers on 9 February were that [...] "You must relieve Kimberley if it costs you <b>half</b> <b>your</b> forces." ...|$|E

500|$|After retiring, Friday {{moved back}} to London and {{returned}} to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: [...] "If you would just settle down {{for three or four}} years, you could play for England". Friday replied with the question [...] "How old are you?", and after Evans answered, continued: [...] "I'm <b>half</b> <b>your</b> age and I've lived twice your life". Evans reflected, [...] "You may well be right". Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978–79 pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday's family secured him a housing association flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people's drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Biographer Paolo Hewitt claimed the incident {{to be the result of}} [...] "a suspected heroin overdose".|$|E
2500|$|Polanyi {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the impact of}} the Nobel Prize on his research, feeling that his name on research proposals and papers often brought additional scrutiny, and also had people questioning his dedication to science after the honour. Polanyi said, [...] "There is a very reasonable suspicion that you are so busy doing the things that Nobel Prize winners do that you are actually only giving <b>half</b> <b>your</b> mind to science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noted of Walker's proper swing {{balance by}} the authors of Lau's Laws on Hitting, [...] "don't be fooled into {{thinking}} that all of his glowing statistics {{are the result of}} playing at Coors Field. [...] He posted some superb numbers in Montreal, too." [...] Former AL batting champion George Brett offered on playing at Coors that [...] "you have to adjust to what the ballpark offers you. [...] The reason I hit the way I do is [...] Stadium — the big outfield and the turf. [...] You play <b>half</b> <b>your</b> games there." [...] Mike Piazza, who finished second to Walker in the 1997 NL MVP voting, commented the same year that [...] "Walker is a great player having a great year. [...] He plays in a great hitter's park, and I think it's unfortunate that some of their players don't get the credit they deserve because of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seepage in {{an upward}} {{direction}} reduces the effective stress within the soil. When the water pressure {{at a point}} in the soil is equal to the total vertical stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero effective stress soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. [...] The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead'). (Note that {{it is not possible to}} be 'sucked down' into quicksand. [...] On the contrary, you would float with about <b>half</b> <b>your</b> body out of the water.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now <b>half</b> <b>your</b> body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E
2500|$|Clooney {{was raised}} a strict Roman Catholic, but said in 2006 {{that he does}} not know if he {{believes}} in Heaven, or even God. He has said, [...] "Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group." [...] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade. In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that [...] "yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having <b>half</b> <b>your</b> face paralyzed." [...] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: [...] "It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you." ...|$|E
