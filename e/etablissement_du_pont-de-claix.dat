In 1983 the Centre de Contrôle des Fréquences (CCF/Nord) moved to Bicêtre from Mont Valérien. In 1991 the Centre National de Soutien des Transmissions arrived at the fort, becoming the Centre de Soutien Spécialisé des Transmissions 2 (CSST2). In 1992 the Direction Centrale des Transmissions (DCT/DCTSI/DCTEI) arrived. In 1994 CSST2 amalgamated with CSST1 in Suresnes and CSST3 in Toulouse to become the Centre National de Soutien Spécialisé des Transmissions (CNSST). In 1996 the Centre d’Études et de Réalisation des Systèmes d’Information de l’Armée de Terre, Bureau Architecture Études (CERSIAT/BAE) was created to manage Army information technology.

HSPCs are usually present in bone marrow (BM) {{during the entire}} life, in cord blood (CB) at birth, or in peripheral blood (PB) under particular circumstances. HSPCs were first harvested in BM and later in CB and PB, as studies showed interesting features of such grafts. All harvesting methods were in use throughout the years, except BM harvesting for HSPC autologous transplantation, which was replaced by PB harvesting. BM, CB, and PB harvesting methods have been developed, and materials and devices technically improved {{to increase the number}} of HSPCs harvested. In parallel, knowing the features of the donors or patients associated with successful numbers of HSPCs allows the adaptation of appropriate harvesting methods. Moreover, it is important to ensure the safety of donors or patients while harvesting. This review describes the methods used for harvesting based on recent studies or developments around these methods, and more particularly, the means developed to increase the numbers of HSPCs harvested in each method. It also explains briefly the influence of technical improvements in HSPC harvesting on potential changes in HSPC graft composition.

50|$|The Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz (Latin: Dioecesis Metensis; French: Diocèse de Metz) is a {{diocese of}} the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. In the Middle Ages {{it was in}} effect an {{independent}} state (prince-bishopric), part of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the prince-bishop who had the ex officio title of count. It was annexed to France by King Henry II in 1552; this was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. It then {{was part of the}} province of the Three Bishoprics. Since 1801 the Metz diocese is a public-law corporation of cult (French: <b>établissement</b> public <b>du</b> culte).|$|R
50|$|Since the 15th century, the diocesan seat {{has been}} the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg. By the Concordat of 1801, the Diocese of Strasbourg became a public-law {{corporation}} of cult (French: <b>établissement</b> public <b>du</b> culte) and the diocesan ambit of Strasbourg was redrawn and all its areas east of the river Rhine were redeployed, forming {{a part of the}} Archdiocese of Freiburg since 1821. On 29 November 1801 it gained territory from the Diocese of Basel (Switzerland), Diocese of Metz and Diocese of Speyer (Spiers, Germany). On 25 February 1803 it lost territory to the Diocese of Konstanz, on 26 April 1808 it gained territory from the same and in 1815 lost territory to that Diocese of Konstanz.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} of the German Empire, before the Weimar Republic, the Protestant churches (Landeskirchen) in Germany were divided along state and provincial borders. Each state or provincial church was {{supported}} by and affiliated with the regnal house - if it was Protestant - of its particular region; the crown provided financial and institutional support for its church. Church and state were therefore, to a large extent, combined on a regional basis. Monarchies of Roman Catholic dynasties also organised church bodies territorially defined by their state borders. The same was true for the three republican German states within the pre-1918 Empire. In Alsace-Lorraine the Napoleonic system of <b>établissements</b> publics <b>du</b> culte for the Calvinist, Jewish, Lutheran and Roman Catholic congregations and umbrellas remained in effect.|$|R
5000|$|Saint-Lambert {{resigned}} from the army in 1758 and devoted {{the rest of his}} life to literature. He wrote several articles for Diderot's Encyclopédie, published an essay on [...] "Luxury" [...] in 1764, brought out an edition of The Seasons with a selection of his other poetry and some short stories in 1769, and completed a multi-volume philosophical work in 1797-98, called Principe des mœurs chez toutes les nations ou Catéchisme universel (Principle of morals among all nations, or universal catechism). He wrote the section on [...] "Siam", and most likely also other parts of the first edition of Guillaume Thomas François Raynals L'Histoire philosophique et politique des <b>établissements</b> et <b>du</b> commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes. He was elected to the Académie française in 1770.|$|R
50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Concordat of 1801 with the Vatican applying to French Roman Catholicism, in 1802 Napoleon I decreed the organic articles which constituted also the other -existing major religious groups in France, the Calvinists (Reformed Christians), Jews and Lutherans, as recognised public religious bodies (<b>établissements</b> publics <b>du</b> culte). These bodies all followed a similar model with semigovernmental leading bodies, such as the Reformed Central Council (Conseil central; est. on 26 March 1852) in Paris, the Lutheran General Consistory (renamed as supreme consistory as of 1852) in Strasbourg and the Israelite Central Consistory in Paris. Subordinate to the chief bodies there were regional consistories each comprising several congregations altogether counting at least 6,000 souls. The organic articles shaped the constitution of the pre-1905 Reformed Church of France.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn May 2007, the French Blood Service (<b>Etablissement</b> français <b>du</b> sang, EFS) {{introduced}} {{systematic screening}} of at-risk blood donors for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies.

Five samples out of 163, 740 were positive, all from individuals originating from an endemic area. One thousand three hundred seventy-four blood donations were considered as equivocal because they had discordant results on the two Elisa tests used in screening. The authors discuss difficulties presented by routine screening of travellers and residents as well as the advantages and drawbacks of the strategy used. They present arguments in favour of its simplification...|$|R
5000|$|He had the {{assistance}} of {{various members of the}} philosophe côteries in his most important work, L'Histoire philosophique et politique des <b>établissements</b> et <b>du</b> commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes (Philosophical and Political History of the Two Indies Amsterdam, 4 vols., 1770). Diderot is credited with a third of this work, which was characterized by Voltaire as [...] "du réchauffé avec de la declamation." [...] The other chief collaborators were Pechméja, Baron d'Holbach, Paulze, the farmer-general of taxes, the Abbé Martin, and Alexandre Deleyre. To this piecemeal method of composition, in which narrative alternated with tirades on political and social questions, was added the further disadvantage of the lack of exact information, which, owing to the dearth of documents, could only have been gained by personal investigation. He released an expanded edition in 1774 and another in 1780.|$|R
50|$|The Protestant {{churches in}} France {{experienced}} a restructuring under Napoléon I. After he had concluded the Concordat of 1801 with the Vatican he decreed the organic articles also concerning the non-Catholic communities of religion (Calvinists, Jews, Lutherans) imposing on them parastatal executive bodies (consistories), constituting and recognising these communities as <b>établissements</b> publics <b>du</b> culte (public bodies of cult) and subjecting them to state control. On 8 April 1802 Napoleon decreed {{the establishment of}} 27 Lutheran consistories, with their ambits comprising several congregations with parishioners amounting to at least 6,000 souls altogether. The chief spiritual board, the General Consistory (Consistoire générale) was established in Strasbourg in Alsace, the region with the biggest share of Lutherans among the overall population. Thus the Église de la Confession d’Augsbourg de France (under this name until 1906) received the basics of its constitution. The chief executive body, the directory (directoire) was also seated in Strasbourg.|$|R
