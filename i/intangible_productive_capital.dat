40|$|Information {{assets are}} one of the most {{valuable}} <b>intangible</b> <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> for a company to compete with its rivals, to learn consumers’ shopping habits, to guide its development directions, and to standout to retain its profitability. However, with the Internet’s characteristic of pervasiveness, information breaches from both external hacking and internal corruption are continuously encroaching a company’s economic profit. This dissertation consists of three studies where each study investigates the different aspects of information security, and it is aimed to address the growing concern of securing a company’s information assets. The first study examines the external hackers’ behaviors and models a Bayesian game between a firm and two discrete types of hackers (domestic and international) based on the framework of Inspection Game. This study explains why external hackings, especially the international ones, are hard to prevent effectively. The second study is an empirical work and explores the other side of information security data breach, which is mainly due to insiders’ (e. g., employee) malicious deeds or noncompliance with information security policy. This study shows that individual reward and punishment together with 100 % detection is the best incentive structure to reduce insider data breaches. In addition, the second study finds that individual reward is more effective than individual punishment, which can better explain why employees are more willing to spend time to comply with security policy when a reward is present. Lastly, the third study is a conceptual work and relies on the Theory of Bounded Rationality to discuss how the Blockchain technology can undermine the motivations of both external and internal intruders in order to prevent information breaches. Overall, this dissertation discusses the current issues of hacking, constructs a payment/incentive structure to regulate noncompliance, empirically tests the validity of the proposed structure, points out a solution to advance information security defense, and provides some managerial recommendations to practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Under the {{new system}} of {{production}} planning and economic incentives, payment for <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> is one element in the overall mechanism of controlling socialist enterprises according {{to the principles of}} full economic accountability. It should improve the utilization of <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> by means of establishing a direct dependence between the amount of payments from profit to the budget and the value of this capital; stimulate the optimal distribution of means of production among enterprises; and serve to accumulate part of enterprise profit in the government budget. At the same time, the application of payment for <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> should not infringe upon the cost accounting interests of normally operating enterprises. Therefore, standardization of that payment must take account of other factors that determine the distribution of profit.

40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} the economic theory of predation into {{the theory of}} economic growth. The analytical framework is a dynamic general-equilibrium model {{of the interaction between}} two dynasties, one of which is a potential predator and the other is its prey. Each generation of each dynasty has to decide how to allocate its endowment of inherited wealth not only to consumption and <b>productive</b> <b>capital,</b> as in standard growth models, but also to either defensive fortifications or offensive weapons. <b>Productive</b> <b>capital</b> forms a basis for accumulation of wealth but in each generation predation can cause both the destruction of wealth and a redistribution of wealth from the prey dynasty to the predator dynasty. We find that, if the current wealth of the potential predator dynasty is small relative to the current wealth of the prey dynasty, then the current generation of the prey dynasty chooses to tolerate predation rather than to deter predation. We also find that over generations the security of the prey dynasty's property and the rate of accumulation of the it's <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> both steadily decrease, while the inherited wealth of the predator dynasty grows relative to that of the prey dynasty. Eventually a generation of the prey dynasty will find that with predation its property is so insecure it is better off increasing its defensive fortifications to deter predation. Importantly, the relation between the security of the prey dynasty's property and its accumulation of <b>productive</b> <b>capital,</b> is neither continuous nor monotonic. Generations of the prey dynasty that choose to deter predation even though their property is secure accumulate <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> more slowly than the preceding generations that tolerated predation. Even if deterrence becomes preferable for the prey dynasty than predation, deterrence is costly. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{question}} of how “green” growth differs from other patterns of economic growth. To this aim we analyze the control problem of a social optimum with waste, abatement and <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> stocks. Consumption generates waste. We have two main results: (1) An environmental Keynes-Ramsey rule showing how along the transitional path, consumption dynamics is affected by capital and waste. One crucial implication is that faster waste emissions do not always call for faster abatement investment, and this effect can generate an overshooting in waste and <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> stock, not present in the standard Keynes-Ramsey model. (2) In the steady state both <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> stock and output are unchanged relative to the standard Ramsey model; nonetheless, the output composition changes since, to make room for abatement investment, steady state consumption must be reduced. We stress that, when abatement activities are treated as flows, the benefits and costs of abatement capital are greatly undervalued. It is the marginal impact of the whole abatement stock that impinges upon waste accumulation and current consumption, not only the additional unit of abatement activity...|$|R

This paper provides a partial equilibrium model which helps {{to understand the}} optimal location choice for a firm in flood risk areas and its investment strategies. How often, when and how much are firms willing to invest in flood risk protection measures? We apply Impulse Control Theory and develop a continuation algorithm to solve the model numerically. We find that, the higher the flood risk and the more the firm values the future, i. e. the more sustainable the firm plans, the more the firm will invest in ood defense. Investmentsin <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> follow a similar path. Hence, planning in a sustainable way leads to economic growth. Sociohydrological feedbacks are crucial for the location choice of the firm, whereas different economic settings {{have an impact on}} investment strategies. If flood defense is already present, e. g. built up by the government, firms move closer to the water and invest less in flood defense, which allows firms to accrue higher expected profits.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the control problem of a social optimum in {{presence}} of waste and capital stocks. We address this problem in two stages. In the first, we suppose that output is fixed; next, we endogenize output allowing for growth. The analytical framework is simple. Consumption is assumed to generate an undesirable residue. Society can control waste accumulation using abatement capital, and rise output using <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> which accumulates over time. We have three main results. (1) On the analytical ground {{we are able to}} find a closed form solution to the optimal consumption with waste, abatement and <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> stocks. (2) For the case of fixed output, we get a solution where stocks and flows affect the dynamics of the system. Environmental policies may have permanent effects on the level of variables. Then, (3) when waste and abatement capital are embedded in a classical growth model, we obtain an Environmental Keynes-Ramsey rule which states that the growth rate of the <b>productive</b> <b>capital</b> is positive if and only if its net marginal productivity is greater than the net social cost it generates, given by the marginal disutility of waste weighted by its shadow cost...|$|R
