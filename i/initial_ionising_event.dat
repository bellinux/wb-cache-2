50|$|Charge {{amplifiers}} {{are also}} used extensively in instruments measuring ionizing radiation, such as the proportional counter or the scintillation counter, where the energy of each pulse of detected radiation due to an <b>ionising</b> <b>event</b> must be measured. Integrating the charge pulses from the detector gives a translation of input pulse energy to a peak voltage output, which can then be measured for each pulse. Normally this then goes to discrimination circuits or a multi channel analyzer.|$|R
5000|$|When {{ionizing}} radiation strikes the tube, some molecules {{of the gas}} are ionized, either directly by the incident radiation or indirectly by means of secondary electrons produced in {{the walls of the}} tube. This creates positively charged ions and electrons, known as ion pairs, in the fill gas. The strong electric field created by the tube's electrodes accelerates the positive ions towards the cathode and the electrons towards the anode. Close to the anode in the [...] "avalanche region" [...] the electrons gain sufficient energy to ionize additional gas molecules and create a large number of electron avalanches which spread along the anode and effectively throughout the avalanche region. This is the [...] "gas multiplication" [...] effect which gives the tube its key characteristic of being able to produce a significant output pulse from a single <b>ionising</b> <b>event.</b> If there were to be only one avalanche per original <b>ionising</b> <b>event,</b> then the number of excited molecules would be in the order of 106 to 108. However the production of multiple avalanches results in an increased multiplication factor which can produce 109 to 1010 ion pairs. [...] The creation of multiple avalanches is due to the production of UV photons in the original avalanche, which are not affected by the electric field and move laterally to the axis of the anode to instigate further <b>ionising</b> <b>events</b> by collision with gas molecules. These collisions produce further avalanches, which in turn produce more photons, and thereby more avalanches in a chain reaction which spreads laterally through the fill gas, and envelops the anode wire. The accompanying diagram shows this graphically. The speed of propagation of the avalanches is typically 2-4 cm per microsecond, so that for common sizes of tubes the complete ionisation of the gas around the anode takes just a few microseconds.This short, intense pulse of current can be measured as a count event {{in the form of a}} voltage pulse developed across an external electrical resistor. This can be in the order of volts, thus making further electronic processing simple.|$|R

5000|$|Geiger-Müller {{tubes are}} the primary {{components}} of Geiger counters. They operate at an even higher voltage, selected such that each ion pair creates an avalanche, but by the emission of UV photons, multiple avalanches are created which spread along the anode wire, and the adjacent gas volume ionizes from {{as little as a}} single ion pair event. This is the [...] "Geiger region" [...] of operation. The current pulses produced by the <b>ionising</b> <b>events</b> are passed to processing electronics which can derive a visual display of count rate or radiation dose, and usually in the case of hand-held instruments, an audio device producing clicks.|$|R

50|$|The {{accompanying}} plot {{shows the}} variation of ionisation current for a co-axial cylinder system. In the ion chamber region, {{there are no}} avalanches and the applied voltage only serves to move the ions towards the electrodes to prevent re-combination.In the proportional region, localised avalanches occur in the gas space immediately round the anode which are numerically proportional {{to the number of}} original <b>ionising</b> <b>events.</b> Increasing the voltage further increases the number of avalanches until the Geiger region is reached where the full volume of the fill gas around the anodes ionised, and all proportional energy information is lost. Beyond the Geiger region the gas is in continuous discharge owing to the high electric field strength.|$|R
5000|$|A key design goal is {{that each}} {{original}} <b>ionising</b> <b>event</b> due to incident radiation produces only one avalanche. This is to ensure proportionality {{between the number of}} original events and the total ion current. For this reason the applied voltage, the geometry of the chamber and the diameter of the anode wire are critical to ensure proportional operation. If avalanches start to self-multiply due to UV photons as they do in a Geiger-Muller tube, then the counter enters a region of [...] "limited proportionality" [...] until at a higher applied voltage the Geiger discharge mechanism occurs with complete ionisation of the gas enveloping the anode wire and consequent loss of particle energy information.|$|R

However, when positive argon ions reach the cathode and become neutral atoms by gaining electrons, the atoms can be elevated to enhanced energy levels. These atoms then return to their ground state by emitting photons which in turn produce further ionisation and thereby spurious secondary discharges. If nothing were done to counteract this, ionisation would be prolonged and could even escalate. The prolonged avalanche would increase the [...] "dead time" [...] when new events cannot be detected, and could become continuous and damage the tube.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} a sizeable increase of activity {{in the field of}} electron-electron coincidence on surfaces. Electron collision and photon absorption have been exploited to perform correlated experiments in a variety of kinematics and involving valence as well as core electrons. In these break-up experiments the kinematics of the <b>ionising</b> <b>event</b> is fully determined. In this talk I shall concentrate on those experiments performed in reflection geometry as they are thought to be particularly suited to investigate surface rather than bulk properties. To understand which is the dominant mechanism that leads to ejection of pairs of electron from the surface and what novel information is yielded by these spectroscopies is the main aim of this work. This issue will be discussed in two cases : a) the grazing and normal incidence (e, 2 e) experiments performed at low and intermediate energies, b) the first angle resolved Auger-photoelectron coincidence experiment. It will he shown that for both classes of experiments, depending on the kinematics chosen, the correlated behaviour of the pairs of electrons detected might prevail on the independent particle one...|$|R
40|$|When {{massive stars}} form, they emit strong, {{hydrogen}} ionising radiation fields into their molecular cloud environment, forming HII regions. This {{is believed to}} be capable of inducing effects which can trigger further star formation through a process known as Radiative Driven Implosion. Hydrodynamic shock fronts are generated at the interface between ionised and un-ionised material. These shocks propagate into the clouds, and their motion and increase in density can result in the conditions required for star formation. Using the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, the effect of varied initial geometrical and physical properties of a molecular cloud on the prospect of radiation triggered star formation is investigated over a large parameter space. The physical processes of the model include a detailed ray-tracing implementation of the ionising radiation, along with a thermodynamic model and chemical evolution for multiple species of atoms. A parameter d_euv, defined as the ratio of the <b>initial</b> <b>ionising</b> penetration depth to the scale length of the cloud along the radiation axis, was found to be an effective indicator of the final evolutionary prospects of the molecular clouds investigated. Low d_euv clouds typically exhibit shock front motion which converges on a focus or foci, and form symmetric or asymmetric B or C type Bright Rimmed Clouds depending on orientation. At medium d_euv there is a mixture of focus/foci convergent and linear or filamentary structure formation with cores formed indirectly, after disruption of material by the shock fronts. At high d_euv only fragment-core and irregular structures form, with the clouds being increasingly dominated by photoevaporation. At extremely high d_euv cores cannot form and the cloud will photoevaporate. In addition, qualitative impressions of the scope of structure morphologies, especially those for irregular morphologies, is compiled. Of note, it is found that the simple initial conditions of a uniform prolate cloud at inclinations to incident radiation are capable of producing a wide variety of the structures observed at HII boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Unrepaired double-strand breaks (DSB) in the sugarphosphate {{backbone}} of the DNA molecule resulting from exposure of cells to ionising radiation {{are believed to be}} critical lesions that can lead to cell killing, mutation and carcinogenesis. Moreover, the pattern of DNA fragmentation is directly related to radiation track structure and, in the case of high-LET radiation, becomes determined by the spatial localisation of <b>ionising</b> <b>events</b> near the centre of the track. [1] Recent pulsed field electrophoresis data have confirmed that the induction of DSBs after high LET irradiation is non-randomly located along DNA and forms clusters of multiply damaged sites that split the DNA helix into a set of small fragments [2]. However, production of multiply fragmented DNA is difficult to assess by conventional methods, since these assays usually can not resolve DNA fragments below 1 kbp. In contrast, by use of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), it is possible to directly visualise the damage provoked by radiation. Recording of the conformation of the induced fragments allows to distinguish among intact DNA molecules (recorded in a supercoiled form), molecules broken at a single strand (visible in a relaxed conformation) and molecules broken at least once at both strands (DSB), giving rise to linear fragments. Analysis of the length of the induced linear fragments allows to establish frequency histograms of fragment lengths for different doses and radiation qualities (Figs. 1 and 2). The results indicate an average fragment length for ions which is systematically smaller than for X-rays at comparable doses, implying an enhanced fraction of multiply broken DNA fragments after particle irradiation. The effect is even present for doses approaching zero, i. e. single particle traversals. Such a behaviour is consistent with the locally correlated induction of DSBs by the elevated local doses around particle tracks and agrees quantitatively with theoretical predictions based on the Local Effect Model (LEM) [4][5]. Here we report on the AFM analysis of the fragment size distribution in a plasmid DNA molecule induced by irradiation with X-rays and 3. 5 MeV u − 1 59 Ni ions [3]...|$|R
40|$|Although the Space Weather {{has been}} {{directly}} and indirectly identified as the source for {{a large percentage of}} S/C abnormal behaviours (through high radiation levels emissions, solar flares and magnetically induced fields), little can be done by FCT operators up until now to minimize the impact of S/C faults. One of the most common observed faults in S/C, are SEUs (Single Event Upsets), which are mainly caused by S/C exposure to excessive amounts of radiation. These SEUs occur when a single <b>ionising</b> radiation <b>event</b> (direct ionisations/proton-induced nuclear reactions) produces a burst of hole-electron pair in a digital circuit, large enough to cause the circuit to change the state, preventing the execution of nominal operations for a particular unit or resulting in permanent damage of the unit itself. One of the responsibilities of the Flight Control Teams is to try to optimise the operations on the S/C during known occurrences of high radiation levels, in order to prolong the expected operation usage time of the instruments.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis was motivated by the large uncertainty on the concentration of atmospheric electrical discharges to the global nitrogen budget. This uncertainty {{is partly due to}} the fact that information concerning the NOx production efficiency of electrical discharges having current signatures similar to those of lightning flashes is not available in the literature. Another reason for this uncertainty is the fact that energy is used as a figure of merit in evaluating NOx production from lightning flashes even though insufficient knowledge is available concerning the energy dissipation in lightning flashes. The third reason for this uncertainty is the lack of knowledge concerning the contribution of discharge processes other than return strokes to the NOx production in the atmosphere. Lightning is not the only process in the atmosphere that causes ionisation and dissociation of atmospheric air. Cosmic rays continuously bombard the Earth with high energetic particles and radiation causing ionization and dissociation of air leading to the production of NOx in the atmosphere. The work carried out in this thesis is an attempt to improve the current knowledge on the way in which these processes contribute to the global NOx production. Experiments have been conducted in this thesis to estimate the NOx production efficiency of streamer discharges, laser-induced plasma, laboratory sparks having current signatures similar to those of lightning flashes, alpha particle impact in air and finally with the lightning flash itself. The results obtained from laboratory electrical discharges show the following: (a) The NOx production efficiency, in terms of energy, of positive streamer discharges is more or less similar to those of hot discharges. (b) The NOx production efficiency of an electrical discharge depends not only on the energy but also on the peak and the shape of the current waveform. (c) The current signature is a better figure of merit in evaluating the NOx yield of electrical discharges. As a part of this thesis work a direct measurement of NOx generated by lightning flashes was conducted and the results show that slow discharge processes such as continuing currents could be the main source of NOx in lightning flashes. Concerning NOx production by other ionisation processes such as alpha particle impacts in the atmosphere, the data gathered in this thesis show that each <b>ionising</b> <b>event</b> in air leads to the creation of one NOx molecule. In terms of energy the NOx production efficiency of alpha particles is similar to that of electrical discharges. The theoretical studies conducted within this thesis indicate that M-components contribute more than the return strokes to the NOx production. The calculations also show that the contribution to the global NOx budget by return stroke is not as high as that assumed in the current literature...|$|R

An algorithm optimised to ﬁnd interactions in the SiW ECAL at small hadron energies is developed. This allows identifying the interaction point in the calorimeter at an efficiency between 62 % and 83 % depending on the energy of the primary particle. The unprecedented granularity of the SiW ECAL allows for the distinction between different interaction types.

BW less than 2500 g, which started enteral intake in the first three day of life. Total volume intake was in range from 70 ml/kg first day, to 170 - 200 ml/kg, after 10 th day of life. Mother's milk fortification was prepared as 5 % mixture solution of preImpamil. The dynamics of biochemical analyses started {{on the first day of}} study and was repeated once weekly. We analyzed levels of: total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferin, urea, Ca ionised, P and alkaline phosphatase using standard biochemical methods.

40|$|Throughout {{their entire}} lives, massive stars {{have a deep}} impact on their {{surroundings}} (e. g. via protostellar outflows, strong winds, <b>ionising</b> radiation, supernovae <b>events).</b> Conceptually this is well understood, but the exact role of these feedback mechanisms on the global star formation process and the stellar environment, {{as well as their}} dependence on the properties of the regions in which massive stars form, are yet to be understood in detail. In this thesis, the effect of ionising feedback from massive stars is analysed with an observational technique called integral field spectroscopy, which yields 3 -dimensional information by allowing one to image the target sources not only in one band or wavelength, but across an entire wavelength range. For this purpose an observational setup and novel analysis techniques are first developed, which are then used to derive a correlation between the feedback-driving, ionising massive stars and the feedback-affected surrounding gas structures, after having tested them on a classical star-forming region. It is found that integral field spectroscopy is ideal to trace feedback from massive stars, and that datasets from such instruments {{can also be used to}} identify and classify the feedback-driving massive stars. The novel methods and techniques developed in this thesis allowed (i) the computation of the mass-loss rate of molecular cloud structures due to photoionisation from the nearby massive stars; (ii) an observationally-derived quantification of the effect of photoionisation by correlating the mass-loss rate of the cloud structures to the photon flux emitted by the feedback-driving stars; (iii) the analysis of the relative contribution of shock and ionising feedback to the excitation of the cloud matter; (iv) the identification of jets originating from young stars embedded in the molecular cloud structures surrounding the massive stars and the analysis of their kinematics and morphologies with respect to the nearby ionising stars. These results demonstrate that that the developed methods allow the study of the effect of ionising feedback from massive stars, and that they deliver an observational quantification of these effects. This thesis sets the ground for future investigations, which, together with ongoing and planned observational campaigns, are aimed at characterising and quantifying high-mass stellar feedback throughout the evolutionary stages of the feedback-driving stars and their environments. This can lead to crucial insight needed to understand the global process of star formation, i. e. how galaxies turn their gas into stars and how this depends on feedback itself...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{was to find}} out the {{readiness}} of the South Bohemian Emergency Medical Service to deal with a potential extraordinary event of radiological nature. The content of the bachelor thesis is to analyze professional, material and technical readiness. The theoretical part deals with characteristics of integrated rescue system, exceptional <b>events,</b> <b>ionising</b> radiation and, last but not least, pre-hospital urgent care for irradiated persons. The practical part of the bachelor's thesis investigated the level of rediness of the Emergency Medical Service of the South Bohemian Region both in professional and material and technical level. There were two hypotheses in the thesis, H 1 : "Medical rescuers have knowledge how to treat patients contaminated with radiological agens," and H 2 : "The emergency medical service has material equipment for the treatment of patients contaminated with radiological agents. " In order to achieve defined goals and to verify hypotheses, a questionnaire was put together and a survey was carried out. A statistical investigation was made using descriptive and mathematical statistics. The questionnaire consisted of closed questions. It contained 11 informative questions, 9 questions focused on problematics of treating patients contaminated with radiological agens, and 4 questions focused on the material and technical equipment of the medical rescue service. Respondents' questions were addressed with 3 - 5 possible answers, only one of which was correct. Data was collected during March 2017. Respondents were members of medical staff of the South Bohemian Emergency Medical Service. Sixty anonymous questionnaires were distributed in the South Bohemian Region, more precisely in the territorial centre České Budějovice and the regional resorts Jindřichův Hradec, Český Krumlov and Tábor. Total of 42 respondents participated in the survey. The results of the survey show that the knowledge of paramedic in this area is below average. The arithmetic mean of knowledge was 5. 79 points out of 9, for material and technical equipment it was 1. 79 points out of 2.
