The principal difference between the groups was in the <b>feed</b> <b>mixes</b> they used. Poultry in Group 1 was fed <b>feed</b> <b>mixes</b> containing a total of 7. 2 - 9. 5 % of meat and bone meal, fish meal and poultry meal and of 3. 4 - 36. 8 % of soybean according to the age category as the main source of protein.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{very little}} {{evidence}} of the similarity of the mechanics of maternal and bottle feeding. We assessed the mechanics of sucking in exclusive breastfeeding, exclusive bottle <b>feeding,</b> and <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding.</b> The hypothesis established was that physiological pattern for suckling movements differ {{depending on the type}} of feeding. According to this hypothesis, babies with breastfeeding have suckling movements at the breast that are different from the movements of suckling a teat of babies fed with bottle. Children with <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>mix</b> both types of suckling movements. Methods Cross-sectional study of infants aged 21 - 28 days with only maternal feeding or bottle feeding (234 mother-infant pairs), and a randomized open cross-over field trial in newborns aged 21 - 28 days and babies aged 3 - 5 months with <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> (125 mother-infant pairs). Primary outcome measures were sucks and pauses. Results Infants aged 21 - 28 days exclusively bottle-fed showed fewer sucks and the same number of pauses but of longer duration compared to breastfeeding. In <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding,</b> bottle feeding compared to breastfeeding showed the same number of sucks but fewer and shorter pauses, both at 21 - 28 days and at 3 - 5 months. The mean number of breastfeedings in a day (in the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> group) was 5. 83 ± 1. 93 at 21 - 28 days and 4. 42 ± 1. 67 at 3 - 5 months. In the equivalence analysis of the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> group, the 95 % confidence interval for bottle feeding/breastfeeding ratio laid outside the range of equivalence, indicating 5. 9 - 8. 7 % fewer suction movements, and fewer pauses, and shorter duration of them in bottle feeding compared with breastfeeding. Conclusions The mechanics of sucking in <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> lay outside the range of equivalence comparing bottle feeding with breastfeeding, although differences were small.
