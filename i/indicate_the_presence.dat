The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{probably}} the apex predator in its ecosystem. It shared its environment with herbivorous dinosaurs such as the titanosaurian sauropod Andesaurus, and the rebbachisaurid sauropods Limaysaurus and Nopcsaspondylus. Other theropods include the abelisaurid Ekrixinatosaurus, the dromaeosaurid Buitreraptor, and the alvarezsaurid Alnashetri. Other reptiles include the crocodyliform Araripesuchus, sphenodontians, snakes, and the turtle Prochelidella. Other vertebrates include cladotherian mammals, a pipoid frog, and ceratodontiform fishes. Footprints <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of large ornithopods and pterosaurs as well.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides were {{originally}} {{settled in the}} Mesolithic era and have a diversity of prehistoric sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800BC. This find may <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt hazelnut shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E

Iron Age hill forts near the city are at Leigh Woods and Clifton Down, {{on the side of}} the Avon Gorge, and on Kings Weston Hill near Henbury. A Roman settlement, Abona, existed at what is now Sea Mills (connected to Bath by a Roman road); another was at the present-day Inns Court. Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia.

5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, {{and the introduction of}} a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Institut Laue–Langevin, Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the neutron magnetic moment and finding a limit to its electric dipole moment. As President of the Universities Research Association during the 1960s {{he was involved in}} the design and construction of the Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. He also headed a 1982 National Research Council committee that concluded that, contrary to the findings of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, that acoustic evidence did not <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a second gunman's involvement in the assassination of President John F.

5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E

5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south {{during this period of}} improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of relatively large and well-organised hunter-gatherer societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead necklaces from the Mesolithic. Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
