40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to develop a three-dimensional, finite volume {{computational}} code for highly swept, twisted, small aspect ratio propeller blades with supersonic tip speeds, {{in a way that}} accounts for cascade effects, hub-induced flow, and nonlinear transonic effects. Attention is presently given to the generation of a computational mesh for such a complex propeller configuration, with the aim of sharing developmental process experience. The problem treated is unique, in that blade chord, blade length, <b>hub</b> <b>length</b> and blade-to-blade distance represent several characteristic length scales among which there is considerable disparity. An ad hoc mesh-generation scheme is accordingly developed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an investigation of}} the key on a stress distribution in a thin-rimmed spur gear. A stress analysis was carried out by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). The 2 D-FE analysis has helped to find the influence of turning the gearing towards the keyway on the stress in the loaded root of the tooth and in the keyway. 2 D and 3 D numerical analysis has been used to find mutual influence of every single notch (root of tooth and keyway), influence of thickness of the <b>hub,</b> <b>length</b> of the key and the form of loading. Verification has been carried out through experimental method...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{calculation of the}} stress distribution in a shaft with a press-fitted hub subjected to axial fretting fatigue. Both normal contact stresses and frictional shear stresses at the shaft-hub interface {{are included in the}} model. The solution of Airy 2 ̆ 7 s function is obtained by means of Fourier integrals. The results are presented for different combinations of <b>hub</b> <b>length,</b> shaft radius and non-slip area and for various values of the coefficient of friction. Special consideration was given to the axial component of the stress, σz, as {{this is the most important}} stress component in the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. Finally, the paper deduces the implications arising from the stress analysis on the fretting fatigue of the junction studied...|$|E

40|$|Low-pressure {{axial fan}} {{impellers}} designed {{according to the}} principle of equal specific work of all elementary stages have blades whose profile near the fan hub is under a significantly larger inclination angle than at the impeller periphery. In order to minimize the spatial curvature of the fan blades and the fan <b>hub</b> <b>length,</b> impeller blades of low-pressure axial fans can be designed with different specific work of elementary stages, so that the specific work of elementary stages is smaller at the hub than at the periphery. This paper presents the operating characteristics of a low-pressure reversible axial fan with straight blade profiles, designed with different specific work of elementary stages. The fan was tested on a standard test rig, with air intake loading on the suction side of the fan...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a parametric study of the behaviour of metal-to-metal contact flanges that have different surface profiles. Using a finite element analysis approach, the important stress values in the flange and bolts and flange rotation/displacement have been obtained for variations in flange thickness, bolt pre-stress and taper angle (different surface profiles) whilst maintaining other leading flange dimensions (<b>hub</b> <b>length</b> and hub thickness) constant, when the vessel/flange component is subjected to internal pressure. In addition, results are compared for the flange geometry with no taper angle on the flange surface with the predictions obtained from the appropriate sections of the ASME, PD 5500 and new European unfired pressure vessel standard EN 13445 Part 3. Based on the results of this study, the best flange dimensions are recommended for 'no leak' conditions from the joint...|$|E
40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} are addressed that are {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into a hub with rounded bore edges. Derived from a formal modeling of the title problem {{in terms of an}} integral equation, a set of normalized parameters is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the hub stress concentration of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the hub outer radius, the <b>hub</b> axial <b>length,</b> the interference, the Young's modulus, and the bending couple. A numerical validation of the normalized parameters is presented. With the aid of Finite Elements, various design charts are compiled that (a) forecast the bending couple initiating the detachment between the shaft and the hub, and (b) report the elastic stress concentrations within the hub versus the proposed normalized parameters in the absence of shaft–hub detachment. Such charts assist the designer in dimensioning an interference fit {{in the presence of a}} bending couple...|$|R

50|$|Rear trials hubs tend to {{be divided}} into two main types based on the dropout spacing they are {{designed}} for, 135 mm and 116 mm, sometimes referred to as 110 mm, with the remaining 6 mm occupied by snail cams, which are a popular means of tensioning the chain in horizontal dropout frames. Of the shorter hubs, almost all of them are 'screw-on' hubs, where the sprocket or freewheel that is fitted to the hub screws onto the side of the hub. There are some <b>hubs</b> of this <b>length</b> that have a freewheel mechanism built into them, most of which are used mainly in BMX. There are also a small number of hubs with a splined section machined onto the side of the hub where a sprocket can be attached with no freewheel mechanism.|$|R
40|$|We study {{synchronization}} in {{the context}} of network traffic on a $ 2 -d$ communication network with local clustering and geographic separations. The network consists of nodes and randomly distributed hubs where the top five hubs ranked according to their coefficient of betweenness centrality (CBC) are connected by random assortative and gradient mechanisms. For multiple message traffic, messages can trap at the high CBC hubs, and congestion can build up on the network with long queues at the congested <b>hubs.</b> The queue <b>lengths</b> are seen to synchronize in the congested phase. Both complete and phase synchronization is seen, between pairs of hubs. In the decongested phase, the pairs start clearing, and synchronization is lost. A cascading master-slave relation is seen between the hubs, with the slower hubs (which are slow to decongest) driving the faster ones. These are usually the hubs of high CBC. Similar results are seen for traffic of constant density. Total synchronization between the hubs of high CBC is also seen in the congested regime. Similar behavior is seen for traffic on a network constructed using the Waxman random topology generator. We also demonstrate the existence of phase synchronization in real Internet traffic data.

40|$|AbstractIn many {{countries}} wind energy {{has become an}} indispensable part of the electricity generation mix. The opportunity for ground based wind turbine systems {{are becoming more and}} more constrained due to limitations on turbine <b>hub</b> heights, blade <b>lengths</b> and location restrictions linked to environmental and permitting issues including special areas of conservation and social acceptance due to the visual and noise impacts. In the last decade there have been numerous proposals to harness high altitude winds, such as tethered kites, airfoils and dirigible based rotors. These technologies are designed to operate above the neutral atmospheric boundary layer of 1300 m, which are subject to more powerful and persistent winds thus generating much higher electricity capacities. This paper presents an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art of high altitude wind power, evaluates the technical and economic viability of deploying high altitude wind power as a resource in Northern Ireland and identifies the optimal locations through considering wind data and geographical constraints. The key findings show that the total viable area over Northern Ireland for high altitude wind harnessing devices is 5109. 6 km 2, with an average wind power density of 1998 W/m 2 over a 20 -year span, at a fixed altitude of 3000 m. An initial budget for a 2 MW pumping kite device indicated a total cost £ 1, 751, 402 thus proving to be economically viable with other conventional wind-harnessing devices...|$|R
