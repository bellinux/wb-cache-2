5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary was {{supported}} by the German Empire, whilst Serbia had the backing of the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the same}} day the {{incident}} occurred, Pakistan ordered the US to shut down and vacate the Shamsi Airfield in the southwestern Balochistan province within a deadline of 15 days. US forces and the Central Intelligence Agency had reportedly leased this airbase in 2001 for joint surveillance and launching drone attacks against militants in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. The Shamsi airbase was the only military base in Pakistan being used by the United States, and orders of its evacuation by US personnel symbolised an increasing rift and <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between Pakistan and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{downturn}} in the aviation sector and ongoing disagreements between Julian Amery, the new Minister of Aviation and BOAC concerning writing off debt incurred buying and troubleshooting new British aircraft resulted in a further <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between the airline and government. Amery commissioned an independent report into the financial performance of BOAC, undertaken by John Corbett. The ongoing disagreement about the funding arrangements for BOAC {{and the need for}} new Vickers VC10 aircraft would eventually be resolved in late 1963, when Slattery formally retired as chairman, though this was widely seen as a resignation; Slattery commented in 1964 that he had effectively been sacked.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024. He was {{succeeded by}} a distant relative, Conrad II (r. 1024–1039), who adopted an {{offensive}} foreign policy. Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolothe husband of Stephen's sisterfrom Venice in 1026. He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, Emeric {{had a strong}} claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother. Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. Conrad II's biographer Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|After 1945, a Hutu counter-elite developed, {{leading to}} a <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between the groups. The Tutsi {{leadership}} agitated for speedy independence to cement their hold on power, while the Hutu elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu, a stance increasingly supported by {{the church and the}} colonial government. In November 1959, the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a fightback, seeking to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians. This plan was thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest re-established law and order, and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite, replacing many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu, and forcing King Kigeli V into exile. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961, and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda to escape the Hutu purges, settling primarily in the four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. The Tutsi exiles were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and sought a quick return to Rwanda. They formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known as the inyenzi (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The inyenzi label resurfaced in the 1990s, as a highly derogatory term used by Hutu hardliners to refer to all Tutsi, dehumanising them. The inyenzi attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them, following up with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|Since regaining independence, Estonia {{has pursued}} {{a foreign policy}} of close {{co-operation}} with its Western European partners. The two most important policy objectives in this regard have been accession into NATO and the European Union, achieved in March and May 2004 respectively. Estonia's international realignment toward the West {{has been accompanied by}} a general <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> with Russia, most recently demonstrated by the protest triggered by the controversial relocation of the Bronze Soldier World War II memorial in Tallinn.|$|E
50|$|The {{rise of the}} Islamist Justice Development Party of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the 2000s has led to {{a steady}} <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> Israel-Turkey <b>relations.</b> Unlike {{previous}} Turkish governments, Erdogan's government has openly condemned Israel's policies towards Palestine and blamed it for the conflict.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> {{political}} <b>relations</b> between Poland and Hungary, around 987 Judith was repudiated and sent away.

25|$|In 1990, during heated {{political}} times {{around the}} Meech Lake Accord, {{the flag of}} Quebec was desecrated by protestors in Brockville, Ontario opposed to Quebec's language laws after the Canadian flag had been burnt in protests in Quebec. Televised images of individuals stepping on the Quebec flag were played in Quebec {{and contributed to the}} <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between Quebec and English Canada. The incident, seen as a metaphor of Canada's perceived rejection of Quebec (and of Quebec's distinctiveness in the demise of the Meech Lake Accord) was invoked by Quebec nationalists during the run-up to the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence and is still remembered today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> with {{neighbouring}} countries {{was one of}} {{the reasons}} given by Compaoré for the coup. Compaoré argued that Sankara had jeopardised foreign relations with the former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast (both of which supported the change in government). Following the coup Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back into the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. Limited democratic reforms were introduced in 1990 by Compaoré. Under the new constitution, Compaoré was re-elected without opposition in 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won election in a landslide. In 2004,13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment. , Burkina Faso remains one of the least developed countries in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{dangers of}} Cokayne's {{political}} position {{must have been}} apparent to him, not least because of the fate of his close friend Ipstones, murdered while in London for the 1394 Parliament by Roger Swynnerton, a relative of Maud. Moreover, the murderer was pardoned in 1397 after an intervention by Baldwin Raddington, controller of the king's wardrobe. Cokayne was clearly not trusted by the king, Richard II, and the Court party: after his brief period of respectability, he received no commissions after 1393. The Ipstones property dispute had wider resonances in the competition between magnates in the region. The Peshales, Maud's in-laws were clients of the Earls of Stafford, as was Ipstones until 1381, when hostilities broke out between them. Gaunt had intervened to get Sir John Holland restored to favour after he murdered the son of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1386, bringing about a <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between the two magnates. Stafford had great influence in his own county and his reach {{came very close to}} Cokayne's home territory around Dovedale. Cokayne faced the same toxic combination of local infamy, official indifference and magnate hostility that encompassed the death of Ipstones. Lancastrian power was much more dominant in Derbyshire than in Staffordshire, making Gaunt a realistic protector for its gentry.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{military}} and political relations between Egypt and Russia witnessed significant improvements after Morsi's overthrow coinciding with the <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between the United States and Egypt, once considered its important ally in the Middle East. Unlike the US, Russia supported Sisi's actions from the start, including his presidential bid. Russia reportedly offered Egypt a huge military weapons deal after the US had suspended some military aid and postponed weapons delivery to Egypt. The Russian President Vladimir Putin {{was the first to}} congratulate Sisi on his inauguration.

2500|$|The {{years of}} 1947-1949 led to <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>relations</b> between Sivatte {{on one side}} and Don Javier and Fal on the other. The Catalan jefe insisted that Junta de Jefes Regionales y Provinciales {{formally}} demands that Don Javier sorts out the 11-year-old regency puzzle, possibly by calling a grand Carlist assembly, but Fal thwarted this attempt and watered down the ultimate message. He also resisted the pressure engineered by Sivatte during the 1947 Aplec de Montserrat. , supported by Fal in the referendum, made Sivatte believe that Franco opened the way for a distant Alfonsist restoration and pushed him for increasingly ultimative tone. The 1948 Aplec de Montserrat, intended as most bold demonstration of Carlist intransigence so far, was banned by the authorities with no protest recorded from national Traditionalist leaders. When Catalan Carlists issued another letter, in February 1949 Fal attempted a last minute rescue mission and travelled to Barcelona, only to be informed that [...] "por aquel camino el carlismo no podía caminar". In March 1949 Don Javier dismissed Sivatte as the Catalan jefe.|$|E
