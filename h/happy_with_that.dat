500|$|With the {{publication}} of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the nature-nurture controversy around the book. [...] "Once again", they wrote, [...] "biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture." [...] They pointed out that the quest for a [...] "sociobiologization" [...] of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis (named by Huxley in 1942) and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology; they were surprised to find that Wilson was <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> and they called the new discipline pop psychology for people [...] "who like telling just-so stories".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E

In the end I was with Briek Schotte and Enkel Thiétard. They were happy just to follow me. We made an agreement. I said that they could stay with me until we got to Kwatrecht. I wouldn't drop them provided they'd do their best to work with me. They were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> They didn't have a choice. Under the bridge at Kwatrecht I just got rid of them." ...|$|E

[...] "After all," [...] he thought bitterly, [...] "she might be <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> rich prig {{than she could}} be with me." [...] He stepped into the hall, {{and spoke to the}} servant. The man had his message ready. Miss Regina would see Mr. Goldenheart, if he would be so good as to wait in the dinning-room.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{the backing}} of FIFA, AFC {{president}} Mohammed Bin Hammam stated that due to AFC criteria the Wellington team must move to Australia or disband by 2011. However, in an interview aired on SBS on 21 December 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated unequivocally that [...] "It is not {{the matter of the}} Confederation, it is the matter of the FIFA Executive Committee... If Wellington will go on play on in Australian League, then as long as Australian league wants to have them and Wellington wants to stay (and) Both association in this case, New Zealand Soccer and Australian Football are <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> then we will give them the blessing. The Confederation can not interfere with that.".|$|E
2500|$|Anderson is [...] With her English {{accent and}} background, she was mocked and felt {{out of place}} as a {{teenager}} in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what {{the answer to that question}} is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, David Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States said [...] "We clearly {{associate}} media {{violence to}} aggressive behavior. But the impact {{was very small}} compared to other things. Some may not be <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> but that's where the science is." [...] In 2001, a meta-analysis review was conducted at Iowa State University {{in order to determine}} a relationship between video game violence and aggression in teenagers. Out of 3,033 participants, the effect size was positive, deducing that high video game violence does in fact lead to heightened aggression amongst teenagers. [...] Another meta-analysis conducted the same year by John Sherry was more skeptical of effects, specifically questioning whether the interactivity of video games made them have more effect than other media.|$|E

2500|$|Gambling {{has always}} had its unsavoury side and {{eventually}} the Artillery Ground became a place of ill-repute. The club members became uneasy about associating with {{a place that was}} widely known for licentious and, occasionally, riotous behaviour, even though it showcased cricket of the highest class. Cricket was severely impacted by the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763 and the number of matches played greatly reduced. There are signs of the game returning to its rural roots during this period and evidently the aristocrats were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> development. Apart from four matches in the 1769 English cricket season, there are few mentions of London as a team {{in the aftermath of the}} Seven Years' War and many of the references suggest that these teams were in fact occasional [...] "London XIs" [...] rather than representing an organised London club.|$|E
2500|$|In May, Tunney competed at the 2012 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Brussels, Belgium. [...] After qualifications, Tunney said, [...] "I competed at the 2010 junior Euros {{but that}} was nothing like here, with a full crowd, it was really great I enjoyed every minute of it. I've {{been working on the}} new vault, the Yurchenko double twist and it's paying off, I was really <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> today." [...] In team finals, she competed on vault, uneven bars, and floor for the British team which placed fourth. [...] "I had good {{performances}} all round and I'm really happy with how the team have done. I was nervous coming into this event but think I've coped really well. To make no mistakes in all my routines so far is brilliant, my floor has been solid all week so I'm looking forward to the final tomorrow." [...] In event finals, she finished fifth on floor with a score of 13.800.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. On {{the way back to}} pit lane, Buemi declared to commentator Dario Franchitti his satisfaction with his success but admitted the victory was handed to him [...] "on a plate" [...] He later felt Rosenqvist was the deserving victor but was happy with the pace of his car: [...] "I think we were {{more or less the same}} pace [...] I’m very <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> result, it just tastes a little bit different than normal." [...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve. There is still a couple of tenths we need to find to be able to fight [...]" ...|$|E

Oh, what walks they would take together! What songs they would sing--the old, old songs! Laura's voice was splendid.

Have you fallen in love already with some beautiful English girl? Oh, be careful and prudent! Be sure, before you set your heart on her, that she is worthy of you! So many women are cruel and deceitful.
