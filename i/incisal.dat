25|$|While the photocopier-generated {{technique}} is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays {{have proven to}} be more accurate. Two recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. Use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between <b>incisal</b> edges to indicate the tooth width. Use of the painting method entails coating the <b>incisal</b> edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 variables were used in analysis. Identification for both methods were based on canine-to-canine distance (1 variable), incisor width (4 variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (8 variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publications}} list tooth wear as {{a consequence}} of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism. Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the <b>incisal</b> edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III <b>incisal</b> relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.|$|E

50|$|Robert M. Ricketts {{developed}} the Utility arch in 1950s {{and it is}} considered to {{be an integral part of}} the Bioprogressive Therapy in Orthodontics. His utility arch is a continuous wire that is engaged in a posterior 1st permanent molar tooth and front four incisors. His utility arch consists of 5 segments: Molar segments, Posterior Vertical Segment, Vestibular segment, anterior vertical segment and <b>incisal</b> segment. The <b>incisal</b> segment lies passively in the <b>incisal</b> brackets of the anterior teeth. This type of intrusion arch employs a statistically indeterminate system.|$|E
50|$|The {{permanent}} maxillary central incisor is {{the widest}} tooth mesiodistally {{in comparison to}} any other anterior tooth. It {{is larger than the}} neighboring lateral incisor and is usually not as convex on its labial surface. As a result, the central incisor appears to be more rectangular or square in shape. The mesial <b>incisal</b> angle is sharper than the distal <b>incisal</b> angle. When this tooth is newly erupted into the mouth, the <b>incisal</b> edges have three rounded features called mammelons. Mammelons disappear with time as the enamel wears away by friction.|$|E

5000|$|Bruxism (clenching and {{grinding}} of the teeth) {{can lead to}} micro-cracking of the <b>incisal</b> edges of the teeth. Extrinsic stains may settle more readily into these cracks, and {{a thin layer of}} enamel can be left. This thin enamel layer is partially transparent, allowing the dark background of the mouth to shine through, affording a darker appearance of the <b>incisal</b> edge.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 incisors are {{anterior}} teeth, 4 in {{the upper}} arch and 4 in the lower. Their function is for shearing or cutting food during chewing. There are no cusps on the teeth. Instead, the surface area of the tooth used in eating is called the <b>incisal</b> ridge or <b>incisal</b> edge. Though similar, there are some minor differences between the primary and permanent incisors.|$|E
50|$|The {{crest of}} {{curvature}} for the palatal and labial surfaces is located directly incisally to the cervical line. The labial {{surface of the}} crown is convex from the crest of curvature to the <b>incisal</b> edge. The lingual surface of the crown is convex near the cingulum and near the <b>incisal</b> edge, {{but for the most}} part is concave along the surface between those two areas.|$|E

50|$|Attrition {{occurs as}} a result of {{opposing}} tooth surfaces contacting. The contact can affect cuspal, <b>incisal</b> and proximal surface areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>incisal</b> {{view of this}} tooth {{considers}} {{the portion of the}} tooth visible from the side where the <b>incisal</b> edge is located. From this angle, only the crown of the tooth is visible, and overall the tooth looks bilateral. The labial surface appears broad and flat. The lingual surface tapers toward the cingulum. The distance between the mesioincisal angle to the cingulum is slightly longer than the distance between the distoincisal angle to the cingulum.|$|E
50|$|From {{a facial}} aspect, maxillary canines are {{approximately}} one millimetre narrower than the central incisor. Their mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. They are slightly darker and more yellow in color {{than the other}} anterior teeth. From a lingual aspect, they have well developed mesial and distal marginal ridges and a well-developed cingulum. A prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual ridge and the marginal ridges. From a proximal aspect, they resemble the incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. Incisally, they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial <b>incisal</b> edge is slightly shorter than the distal <b>incisal</b> edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long axis of the tooth. They are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally. Because of the disproportionate <b>incisal</b> edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical. Mesially, the contact sits at the junction of the <b>incisal</b> and middle third of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, {{in the middle of}} the middle third of the crown.|$|E
5000|$|Overbite {{medically}} {{refers to}} the extent of vertical (superior-inferior) overlap of the maxillary central incisors over the mandibular central incisors, measured relative to the <b>incisal</b> ridges.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the longest}} tooth in total length (from the root to the <b>incisal</b> edge) in the mouth. Canines are also the only {{anterior}} teeth with a cusp.|$|E
50|$|Contact with {{adjacent}} {{teeth in}} the same arch {{is referred to as}} interproximal contacts. The maxillary central incisors are one of only two types of teeth which has an interproximal contact with itself. The other type of teeth is the mandibular central incisors. In usually preferred and healthy states, the central incisors touch in the <b>incisal</b> third of the teeth. On the other hand, the contact between the central incisor and the lateral incisor is nearer the gingiva at the location between the <b>incisal</b> and middle thirds of the tooth's crown.|$|E
50|$|In the {{longitudinal}} {{section of a}} tooth. these lines appear near the dentin. They bend obliquely near the cervical region. They curve occlusally near the cuspal regions or the <b>incisal</b> regions.|$|E
50|$|The mandibular {{lateral incisor}} is the tooth located {{distally}} (away from the midline of the face) from both mandibular central incisors {{of the mouth}} and mesially (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular canines. As with all incisors, their function is for shearing or cutting food during mastication, commonly known as chewing. There are no cusps on the teeth. Instead, the surface area of the tooth used in eating is called an <b>incisal</b> ridge or <b>incisal</b> edge. Though relatively the same, there are some minor differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular lateral incisor {{and that of the}} permanent mandibular lateral incisor.|$|E
50|$|The maxillary central incisor {{is a human}} tooth in {{the front}} upper jaw, or maxilla, and is usually the most visible of all teeth in the mouth. It is located mesial (closer to the midline of the face) to the maxillary lateral incisor. As with all incisors, their {{function}} is for shearing or cutting food during mastication (chewing). There is typically a single cusp on each tooth, called an <b>incisal</b> ridge or <b>incisal</b> edge. Formation of these teeth begins at 14 weeks in utero for the deciduous (baby) set and 3-4 months of age for the permanent set.|$|E
50|$|The mesial {{view of this}} tooth {{considers}} {{the portion of the}} tooth visible from the side closest to where the middle line of the face would be.the mesial exis should be parallel to the midline. The mesial side of the maxillary central incisor shows the crown of the tooth as a triangle with the point at the <b>incisal</b> edge and the base at the cervix. The root appears cone shaped with a blunt apex. Unlike most other teeth, a line drawn {{through the center of the}} <b>incisal</b> edge will also cross through the center of the root apex. This also occurs in maxillary lateral incisors.|$|E
50|$|The width from Left Premolar to Right Premolar or Measured Premolar Value (MPV) can be {{calculated}} by using Sum of <b>Incisal</b> Widths (S.I) of incisors and multiplying it by 100. The result can be divided by 80.|$|E
50|$|Type I - Talon: The {{additional}} cusp or talon projects {{from the}} palatal {{surface of a}} primary or permanent anterior (front) tooth that extends {{at least half of}} the distance from the cemento enamel junction to the <b>incisal</b> edge.|$|E
50|$|The maxillary canine is {{the tooth}} located {{laterally}} from both maxillary lateral incisors {{of the mouth}} but mesially from both maxillary first premolars. It is the longest tooth in total length, from root to the <b>incisal</b> edge, in the mouth.|$|E
50|$|The palatal {{view of this}} tooth {{considers}} {{the portion of the}} tooth visible from the side where the tongue would be. The palatal side of the maxillary central incisor has a small convexity, called a cingulum near the cervical line and has a large concavity, called the lingual fossa. Along the mesial and distal sides are slightly raised portions called marginal ridges. The lingual <b>incisal</b> edge is also raised slightly {{to the level of the}} marginal ridges. The lingual fossa is bordered incisally by the lingual <b>incisal</b> edge, mesially by the mesial marginal ridge, distally by the distal marginal ridge, and cervically by the cingulum. Developmental grooves are found on the cingulum and lying into the lingual fossa.|$|E
50|$|The central incisors have fossa {{on their}} lingual surfaces. Their mesial and distal {{proximal}} contacts {{are located in}} the <b>incisal</b> third. The facial and lingual heights of contour are in the cervical third, {{as is the case with}} all incisors and canines.|$|E
50|$|More {{than any}} other tooth in the mouth, the {{cervical}} line from this view curves tremendously toward the <b>incisal.</b> In an average crown length of 10.5 to 11 mm, the curvature of the cervical line in a maxillary central incisor is 3 to 4 mm.|$|E
50|$|The mandibular central incisor is {{the tooth}} {{located on the}} jaw, {{adjacent}} to the midline of the face. It is mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular lateral incisors. As with all incisors, its function includes shearing or cutting food during mastication, commonly known as chewing. There are no cusps on the tooth. Instead, the surface area of the tooth used in eating is called an <b>incisal</b> ridge or <b>incisal</b> edge. Though the two are similar, there are some minor differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular central incisor {{and that of the}} permanent mandibular central incisor. The mandibular central incisors are usually the first teeth to appear in the mouth, typically around the age of 6-8 months.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{anesthetic}} {{may be used}} {{to relieve}} symptoms while the lesion heals. Fibrous lesions may require surgical excision. The <b>incisal</b> edges of the mandibular teeth can be smoothed to minimize the chance of trauma. This type of lesion usually resolves in 7-10 days, but may recur with repeated performances.|$|E
5000|$|Loss of tooth anatomy: This {{results in}} loss of tooth {{characteristics}} including rounding or sharpening of <b>incisal</b> edges, loss of cusps and fracturing of teeth. Enamel of molar teeth may appear thin and flat. When in occlusion the teeth may appear {{the same height}} which is particularly apparent for anterior teeth.|$|E
5000|$|The maxillary lateral incisors are a pair {{of upper}} (maxillary) teeth that are located {{laterally}} (away from the midline of the face) from both maxillary central incisors of the mouth and medially (toward the midline of the face) from both maxillary canines. As with all incisors, their function is for shearing or cutting food during mastication, commonly known as chewing. There are generally no cusps on the teeth, but the rare condition known as talon cusps are most prevalent on the maxillary lateral incisors. [...] The surface area of the tooth used in eating is called an <b>incisal</b> ridge or <b>incisal</b> edge. Though relatively the same, there are some minor differences between the deciduous (baby) maxillary lateral incisor {{and that of the}} permanent maxillary lateral incisor. The maxillary lateral incisors occlude in opposition to the mandibular lateral incisors.|$|E
50|$|Tooth gemination is {{a dental}} {{phenomenon}} {{that appears to}} be two teeth developed from one. There is one main crown with a cleft in it that, within the <b>incisal</b> third of the crown, looks like two teeth, though it is not two teeth. The number of the teeth in the arch will be normal.|$|E
5000|$|All incisors {{have the}} {{potential}} to be affected by a case of congentital syphilis, which can cause a notch to form on the <b>incisal</b> edges of these teeth. These teeth, sometimes described as screwdriver-shaped, are called [...] "Hutchinson's incisors." [...] They serve as part of Hutchinson's triad, which also includes interstitial keratitis and eighth nerve deafness.|$|E
