25|$|Roles {{are added}} to a class or object with the does keyword, as opposed to inheritance's is. The {{keywords}} reflect the differing meanings of the two features: role composition gives a class {{the behavior of the}} role, but doesn't indicate that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> the same thing as the role.|$|E

Circular supersonic jets also generate screech tones. In this case, however, there can be three modes of motion: symmetric (toroidal), asymmetric (sinuous), and helical. These whistles are unlike the others listed above; the sound is generated without interaction with a solid; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> an aerodynamic whistle.|$|E

25|$|As {{the story}} proceeds, one can note that many events are perceptual and not certain. By reading both stories some sense {{can be made}} from this poetic styled puzzle. The words written are a vague mix of poetry and stream of {{consciousness}} prose. Both Hailey and Sam depict their feelings as well as ideas and thoughts towards one another. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> difficult to summarize the plot as most readers will understand the parts of story in different ways.|$|E
25|$|News grows even grimmer as Weidling {{reports to}} Hitler {{there are no}} {{reserves}} left, and Mohnke reports that the Red Army is only 300 to 400 metres from the Reich Chancellery. Hitler reassures the officers that General Walther Wenck's 12th Army will save them. After Hitler leaves the conference room, Weidling firmly asks if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> possible for Wenck to attack; the generals all {{agree that it is}} impossible, but still resolve to never surrender. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. Hitler orders Goebbels to leave Berlin, but Goebbels refuses. The following morning, Weidling reports that not only was Wenck not able to attack, all of their remaining armies are now incapable of any meaningful action, and that the Reich {{is no more than a}} few hours away from total defeat. Finally accepting that there is no hope, Hitler decides to kill himself before he can be captured.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> {{a cruise}} which tested the crew's mettle and proved the skipper's tenacity. [...] More than that, however, it again proved {{to all who}} cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required. [...] It's a good sea story about doing {{what had to be}} done. [...] On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's {{a good thing to do}} to re-read about one of the {{forerunners}} of all we're done since.|$|E

500|$|Adult {{entertainment}} attorney Robert Apgood stated {{he agreed}} with the actions of Acworth and Randazza. Apgood pointed out he had observed {{a significant increase in}} applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed [...] "scandalous" [...] by the government. He stated, [...] "It's really quite unfortunate that the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight." [...] The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. The application status was last listed as [...] "abandoned" [...] for failure to respond by the appealing party.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I {{really want to}} find out if she was paid by them for making it ..... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> shameful. I would suggest a boycott of this singer whom I really liked if you are as offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, so I wanted to go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Eagle Boys {{launched}} a multimillion-dollar campaign [...] "31 New Menu Items – Each One Delicious”. The campaign {{was the first}} to use Eagle Boys' new phone name 1300 EAGLE BOYS. New pastas were among the 31 new menu offerings, Desserts were also included, among them a chocolate fudge mousse that received a Gold Medal at the 2010 Royal Queensland Food and Wine Show. The menu was tested over a 12-month period ahead of the launch. Eagle Boys told media it expected a 15% spike in sales {{on the back of the}} launch. A gluten [...] "friendly" [...] base was also on the menu for the first time, with an Eagle Boys spokesperson claiming it was more transparent than claiming it could offer a gluten-free base—only food prepared in a gluten-free kitchen can make the claim that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> offering a gluten free range. The chain also announced it would scale back its social media spend.|$|E
500|$|In March 1926-October 1928, Tudor Vianu's Gândirea {{magazine}} {{published his}} novel Craii de Curtea-Veche as a series. He completed the last {{additions to the}} text in November 1927, as its first sections were already in print. As the last episode was featured by Gândirea, to widespread acclaim, he noted: [...] "From {{the time when the}} first of its parts saw print, this work was received with unprecedented fervor in Romanian literature. For the work it required, {{as well as for the}} tiresome obsession to which it had me submitted I bear it no grudge: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> magnificent [...]" [...] Literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, who criticized Gândirea 's later moves towards traditionalism and a far right ideology (a turn which coincided with Vianu's departure), argued that Caragiale had been an important gain for the literary venue. In his belief, Caragiale and other [...] "writers of talent" [...] helped the magazine, which had no [...] "critic of authority" [...] at its helm.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Jose F. Promis, {{wrote that}} [...] "the song finds Madonna giving an {{understated}} and inspired performance [...] One hopes that this overlooked gem might {{find its way}} onto future [...] hits collections, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a wonderful song". Author Thomas S. Hischak called it [...] "plaintive". Billboards Geoff Burpee [...] called it [...] "A sterling, intimate moment from the Evita soundtrack. Yes kids, she [...] can sing". Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and clear as a bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am I going to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, described the track as [...] "a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution {{with a series of}} drab johns".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2015 the Daily Maverick {{published}} Allan's {{op-ed piece}} on feminism in popular culture. Cape Town academic, Rhoda Kadalie praised the [...] "well-written" [...] piece [...] "on feminism because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> controversial in many ways. Jani {{deals with the}} nexus of race, sex, wealth and beauty as pertains to the entertainment industry and her critiques are valid." [...] Allan's column for the special annual edition of the Big Issue South Africa was published in December 2015. In the same month the Daily Maverick published Allan's widely circulated open letter column to her former editor, Tertius Myburgh. Allan wrote the column following the revelation of several spy allegations against Myburgh.|$|E

2500|$|By August 1999, {{the band}} had {{recorded}} over 30 songs for the album, tentatively titled 2000 Intentions. During a 1999 interview with MTV's Kurt Loder, Rose announced {{the title of}} the upcoming album to be Chinese Democracy, stating [...] "there's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's a lot of talk about, and it's something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a melting pot." ...|$|E

More recently rocktrain.net also commented about Tench's guitar solo on the same recording, stating that [...] "of particular note is the zinging, joyous lead guitar of Bobby Tench.

[...] In a separate statement, Saddam's American defense lawyer called the execution [...] "an unfortunate display of arrogant aggressor's injustice by the United States of America {{under the leadership of}} American President George W. Bush. It sets back achievements in international criminal law many decades and sends a clear message to {{people all over the world}} that the United States' aggression cannot be stopped by the law. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a sad day for international justice and sad beginning to a new year." ...|$|E
