5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E
25|$|Most of Washington's {{surviving}} {{paintings are}} held at VMI, {{but a few}} have {{made their way into}} various museum collections, including those of the Morris Museum of Art and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts; in addition, a portrait of John Marshall, which he painted for the Fauquier County Courthouse in Warrenton, Virginia, is still <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> today. Prints of The Burial of Latané were also popular, and some may still be found in various collections.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey's success {{seemed to}} have gone to his head and he became even more arrogant. He was abusive to the network's affiliates, advertisers, {{producers}}, and talent. Friends of Aubrey's such as producers Dick Dorso of United Artists, Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, and David Susskind, who had each sold several series to CBS, suddenly found themselves shut out. [...] "He's a friend of mine, but he cut me stone cold last year," [...] Susskind said. [...] "I was <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> with my pants down, wondering what I'd tell the stockholders." [...] Gossip columnist Liz Smith, who worked as CBS during Aubrey's time there, called him a [...] "a mean, hateful, truly scary, bad, outré guy." ...|$|E
60|$|Orders {{were also}} issued {{for a party}} of men to proceed to the quay, and to arrest and carry off anyone they might find <b>hanging</b> about <b>there.</b>|$|R
50|$|After 1829, for a period, Barnard was a {{designated}} Keeper of the British Institution. According to Thomas Uwins, {{he was in}} charge of <b>hanging</b> exhibitions <b>there.</b> He died November 11, 1849.|$|R
60|$|Behind the <b>hangings</b> <b>there</b> was a {{space of}} about three feet in width {{between them and the}} wall, making a {{passageway}} entirely around the room, broken only by the single entrance opposite them; this being a common arrangement especially in the sleeping apartments of the rich and powerful upon Barsoom. The purposes of this arrangement were several. The passageway afforded a station for guards {{in the same room with}} their master without intruding entirely upon his privacy; it concealed secret exits from the chamber; it permitted the occupant of the room to hide eavesdroppers and assassins for use against enemies that he might lure to his chamber.|$|R
500|$|Prien {{turned his}} {{submarine}} and attempted another shot via his stern tube, but this too missed. Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at Royal Oak, This {{time he was}} successful: at 01:16 all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew {{a hole in the}} armoured deck, destroying the Stokers', Boys' and Marines' messes and causing a loss of electrical power. Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship's internal spaces. Royal Oak quickly listed some 15°, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45°, <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien's second strike. 833 men died with the ship, including Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the Second Battle Squadron. Over one hundred of the dead were Boy Seamen, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action. [...] The admiral's wooden gig, moored alongside, was dragged down with Royal Oak.|$|E
2500|$|Keegan {{made his}} maiden speech {{in a debate}} on capital {{punishment}} in March 1956, supporting Sydney Silverman's attempt to abolish hanging. He argued that abolition was not [...] "a lot of sentimental ninnies {{who did not know}} what they were doing", but that instead supporters of hanging allowed sentiment to deter them from examining statistics in a proper frame of mind. However, he did want some assurance that with the abolition of <b>hanging,</b> <b>there</b> was no danger to public safety. Keegan was in a minority in the Conservative Party in supporting abolition. Silverman's Bill was passed but rejected by the House of Lords; when the Government then brought in the compromise Homicide Bill restricting the use of capital punishment, Keegan felt he could support it.|$|E
2500|$|Adam details {{sacrificial}} practices {{held at the}} temple; Adam describes {{that nine}} males of [...] "every living creature" [...] are offered up for sacrifice, and tradition dictates that their blood placates the gods. The corpses of the nine males are hung within the grove beside the temple. Adam says that the grove is considered extremely sacred to the heathens, {{so much so that}} each singular tree [...] "is considered to be divine," [...] due to the death of those sacrificed or their rotting corpses <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> and that dogs and horses hang within the grove among the corpses of men. Adam reveals that [...] "one Christian" [...] informed him that he had seen seventy-two cadavers of differing species hanging within the grove. Adam expresses disgust at the songs they sing during these sacrificial rites, quipping that the songs are [...] "so many and disgusting that it is best to pass over them in silence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christmas cactus, {{also known}} as orchid cactus, often blooms around Christmas time. Pendulous stems of Christmas cactus make it a great choice for <b>hanging</b> baskets. <b>There</b> {{are a number of}} {{different}} cactus species sold as [...] "Christmas cactus." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Quentin!" [...] gasped Peter, {{stretching}} out both hands towards the martyrs, whose now soulless frames were <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> [...] "it's--it's Marion an'--" ...|$|E

60|$|Returning {{through the}} same square about an hour later, having almost {{forgotten}} about the slave by that time, they were horrified to observe that the wretched man was still <b>hanging</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Radio Times {{called the}} film a [...] "far-fetched B-movie...Terence Fisher directs with little enthusiasm, but it's worth <b>hanging</b> in <b>there</b> {{to catch the}} debut of Tommy Steele"; while TV Guide wrote, [...] "it's overplayed and melodramatic but has enough intrigue to make it watchable." ...|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{previous}} styles of <b>hanging</b> scroll mountings, <b>there</b> {{are a few}} additional ways to format the hanging scroll.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{on the front of}} the album is the Suki-Yaki inn, a small Japanese restaurant from downtown Spokane. The band was known for <b>hanging</b> out <b>there</b> a lot when they were younger. The inn is a couple of blocks away from Outback Jack's, where the album was recorded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} haven't killed him, Sharpeye," [...] said Kenneth, looking with some anxiety at the Indian's girdle, {{as though he}} {{expected}} to see a fresh and bloody scalp <b>hanging</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

60|$|We {{rose from}} table. Cigars went round. We adjourned to the smoking-room. It was a Moorish marvel, with Oriental <b>hangings.</b> <b>There,</b> Senator Wrengold and Charles {{exchanged}} reminiscences of bonanzas and ranches and other exciting post-prandial topics; while the magazine editor cut in {{now and again}} with a pertinent inquiry or a quaint and sarcastic parallel instance. It was clear he had an eye to future copy. Only Algernon Coleyard sat brooding and silent, with his chin on one hand, and his brow intent, musing and gazing at the embers in the fireplace. The hand, by the way, was remarkable for a curious, antique-looking ring, apparently of Egyptian or Etruscan workmanship, with a projecting gem of several large facets. Once only, {{in the midst of}} a game of whist, he broke out with a single comment.|$|R
60|$|You are not {{to suppose}} that this command was {{dictated}} by any sense of mercy. Lord Churchill {{was no more than}} just when he spoke of the King's heart as being as insensible as marble. It had been realized that in these wholesale <b>hangings</b> <b>there</b> was taking place a reckless waste of valuable material. Slaves were urgently required in the plantations, and a healthy, vigorous man could be reckoned worth at least from ten to fifteen pounds. Then, there were at court many gentlemen who had some claim or other upon His Majesty's bounty. Here was a cheap and ready way to discharge these claims. From amongst the convicted rebels a certain number might be set aside to be bestowed upon those gentlemen, so that they might dispose of them to their own profit.|$|R
60|$|He sighed, {{scarcely}} {{hearing what}} she said. She waited, wishing he would go. At last {{he kissed her}} quickly and climbed the fence. Looking round he saw the pale blotch of her {{face down in the}} darkness under the <b>hanging</b> tree. <b>There</b> was no more of her but this pale blotch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't it {{make you}} conceited, Courtenay," [...] she asked, [...] "to look at all those foreign {{newspapers}} <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> and know {{that most of them}} have got paragraphs and articles about your Persian speech?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Look at that shop,' he said. 'It's {{twenty minutes}} to twelve, and there's seven dozen geese <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> that I'm {{willing to give}} away, and this fool asks me if I want to buy another.' ...|$|E
60|$|She partly drew {{aside the}} curtain of the long, low garret window and called our {{attention}} {{to a number of}} bird-cages <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> some containing several birds. There were larks, linnets, and goldfinches--I should think at least twenty.|$|E
5000|$|Calabasas Hanging Tree: Oak tree once located {{next to a}} small jail {{building}} in Old Town Calabasas, California. Died in the 1960s and felled by a storm in 1995. A second tree that still stands in Calabasas is also rumored to {{have been used for}} <b>hangings,</b> though <b>there</b> is debate as to which tree was the real hanging tree.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, it {{included}} an African American entertainment district. In 1906 {{it was the}} trigger point of the Atlanta Race Riot; allegations that the street's dive bars, frequented by blacks, were showing nude pictures of white women and [...] "troublesome Negro vagrants" [...] were <b>hanging</b> around <b>there</b> were among the allegations whipping up anti-black sentiment among poor whites.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{have too}} many nice suits," [...] he said, approvingly, [...] "not a young feller like you that wants to look nice. All the nice girls like a young feller that dresses nice. When you go out of here in a suit I got <b>hanging</b> up <b>there</b> at the back, the girls 'll be all over you like flies round a honey-pot." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was poor}} Billy, <b>hanging</b> <b>there</b> still, half {{unconscious}} with weariness and fear. The belt had slipped up under his arms, {{so he could}} breathe easily; and there he was, looking like a queer sort of cone on the blasted pine.|$|E
6000|$|... "We went downstairs, and I {{borrowed}} two overcoats that {{we found}} <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> {{and put them on}} over our uniforms. Then we went out, by the back door, and ran as hard as we could, keeping through narrow lanes, to the barracks.|$|E
60|$|The wolf looked up, and saw {{the bucket}} <b>hanging</b> <b>there,</b> and with some {{difficulty}} he climbed into it. As he weighed {{at least four times}} as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{people call}} him the Tree Bat. After seeing him <b>hanging</b> over <b>there</b> I think you can guess why. He rarely goes to a cave for his daytime sleep, as most of his {{relatives}} do, but hangs by his toes from a twig of a tree or bush, frequently {{not far from the}} ground, just as he is right now.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{changed its}} name to The Makers in late-1976 and played as a punk band at the Roxy in their early years. In 1978 they became a power pop band and changed the name to Gentry, under which they played a few gigs, {{including}} at Kingsway College. They changed the band's name to Spandau Ballet after a friend of the band, journalist and DJ Robert Elms, saw the phrase [...] "Spandau Ballet" [...] scrawled on the wall of a nightclub lavatory during a visit to Berlin. The expression [...] "Spandau Ballet" [...] was slang used by Allied troops in the trenches in the First World War referring to the twitching of the corpses hanging on the barbed wire and repeatedly hit by Spandau machine gun fire from the German lines. The name also refers to Spandau Prison and the many <b>hangings</b> <b>there,</b> especially in 1945-46 of Nazi war criminals, when those being hanged would twitch and jump {{at the end of a}} rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nests," [...] replied Fidget. [...] "I've {{just been}} telling Peter that while Cousin Sprite may like {{to build in}} that <b>hanging</b> moss down <b>there,</b> it wouldn't suit me at all." ...|$|R
