500|$|The normal {{rules of}} {{causation}} apply, although {{they can become}} strained {{when compared to the}} various moral issues of importance in cases of homicide. In R v. Pagett, the defendant was found guilty of the manslaughter of a hostage he was using as a human shield, who was killed by police returning fire against the defendant. Whether another's actions are [...] "free, voluntary and informed" [...] is the operating definition, as upheld in R. v Kennedy (No. 2) where the defendant was acquitted. Such an <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> is known as a [...] "novus actus interveniens". The judgments of several judges in various cases, including Devlin J in R. v Adams appear to confuse causality with motive: where there is a strong moral imperative to clear the defendant, causality is doubted, rather than the mental element (mens rea). Since everyone will die at some point, then even murder is a mere acceleration of death. In Adams the question of life-shortening palliative care was approached, and the need to provide a suitable reason with which to distinguish the doctor from any other murderer. Ultimately it seems a special defence was created.|$|E

2500|$|The action having raised {{three of}} Adams's {{prerequisites}} to liability, the Barons of the Exchequer engaged defendant's counsel in a protracted discussion of whether Priestley {{was required to}} ride in the wagon or could have walked alongside it, then intended that the declaration was sufficient on this point. Serjeant Adams concluded his advocacy by proclaiming that [...] "there is nothing in the declaration which shews that this was anything more than a mere accident; and for a mere accident which happens in a master's service, the master is not responsible." [...] As with the arguments presented by his opposing counsel, Adams never raised the prospect of vitiating his client's liability due to the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> of a fellow servant.|$|E

50|$|Usually the {{transfer}} of ownership of real estate is registered at a cadastre in the United Kingdom. In {{most parts of the}} United States, deeds must be submitted to the recorder of deeds, who acts as a cadastre, to be registered. An unrecorded deed may be valid proof of ownership between the parties, but may have no effect upon third-party claims until disclosed or recorded. A local statute may prescribe a period beyond which unrecorded deeds become void as to third parties, at least as to <b>intervening</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{person who}} claimed to be a victim of crime could make an {{application}} for victims compensation to the VCT. Potential recipients of compensation were one, the primary victim; two, the secondary victim and three, family victims. Applications were to be lodged within two years of the alleged act of violence {{or in the case of}} a family victim within two years of the death of the primary victim. An application lodged out of time could be accepted if the applicant established there were [...] "good reasons to do so". Leave is usually given in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence or child abuse. Commonly accepted reasons for leave being granted were the age of the victim, the nature of the offence, the impact of the act of violence on the victim and various <b>intervening</b> <b>acts.</b> Simply being unaware of the scheme would not be a sufficient reason for delay.|$|R
50|$|If {{the act of}} {{the accused}} is of a kind which is {{unlikely}} to cause death, the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> or event is considerably {{more likely to be}} regarded as a novus actus interveniens.|$|E
50|$|A {{novus actus interveniens}} (or nova causa interveniens) is a new <b>{{intervening}}</b> <b>act,</b> or a new intervening cause: that is to say, {{an abnormal}} interposition or event which breaks the chain of causation. A number of factors are important, according to Burchell, in determining what kind of <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> or event breaks the causal chain. It is important {{to bear in mind}} that this stage of the enquiry involves strong policy considerations. It is not an enquiry merely into {{whether or not there was}} some kind of additional or external factor that contributed towards the consequence in question; the enquiry is into whether that factor is of such a nature and magnitude that it should exonerate the accused from liability for the actual consequences of his conduct.|$|E
50|$|His parents {{sued the}} council for negligence.

40|$|This art project {{examines}} {{aspects of}} New Zealand rural culture through {{the experience of}} a fictional performer, Mrs Gallagher. She questions the instrumental approach of agribusiness production, both as it enframes her domestic/farm helper role and the farming of animals. She uses the practices of everyday life, domestic crafts and appropriated materials of agribusiness {{to draw attention to the}} traditional ideological boundaries between the human/animal and assigned gender roles. Employing the tactics of 'making do', Mrs Gallagher uses inventive play to produce new forms that cross the domestic/agribusiness boundary. It is her aim that her acts of intervention and these hybrid forms will promote a more mindful use of technology and greater recognition of the continuity and difference that exists between humans and nature. All objects will be presented in site-orientated installation. Evidence of Mrs Gallagher's <b>intervening</b> <b>acts</b> is witnessed and documented using time-based media by a collaborative performer, the cultural theorist K. Joules Faraday. This thesis is constituted as 80 % practice based work and 20 % written exegesis...|$|R

50|$|There is one {{situation}} in which an <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> or event that would ordinarily qualify as a novus actus interveniens will not be regarded as such. This occurs when the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> or event was actually planned, intended or foreseen by the accused, {{in the sense that}} it was a calculated part of the causal sequence. As some authorities put it, intended consequences can never (almost by definition) be “too remote” to found liability. The relevant principle has been explained by the Appellate Division, which ruled in Ex parte die Minister van Justisie: In re S v Grotjohn that, where the act is a calculated part of the chain of causation which the perpetrator started, and is an eventuality which the perpetrator foresees as a possibility, and which he desires to employ to obtain his object, it would be contrary to accepted principles of law, and to all sense of justice, to allow him to take shelter behind the act as a novus actus interveniens.|$|E
5000|$|Breaking {{the chain}} (or novus actus interveniens, {{literally}} [...] "new act intervening") refers in English law {{to the idea}} that causal connections are deemed to finish. Even if the defendant can be shown to have acted negligently, there will be no liability if some new <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> breaks the chain of causation between that negligence and the loss or damage sustained by the claimant.|$|E

50|$|The live {{show was}} greeted with average to good reviews, with The Daily Telegraph and the London Evening Standard giving it 4 out of 5 stars, while The Times and The Independent gave it 3 stars. The length of the show {{and size of the}} arena were pointed out as detracting points. Michael McIntyre and Lee Evans were universally {{recognised}} as being the best acts of the show. Other noted acts were Jack Dee, John Bishop, Rich Hall, Noel Fielding, and a musical routine by Bill Bailey and Kevin Eldon. With McIntyre being closer of the first half, and Evans closing the show, they had both been given longer than the 5 minutes given to most acts, leading to observations that this meant the <b>intervening</b> <b>acts</b> had neither the time to die a death, or heat up the performance beyond being just enjoyable. The inclusion of Katie Price and Alex Reid was questioned; they were roundly booed by the audience. Media outlets picked up on Patrick Kielty and Sean Lock's inclusion of gags about Michael Jackson, who had been planning to stage his farewell concerts at the arena before his shock death nine months previously. The appearance of James Corden and Ruth Jones in character from popular sit-com Gavin and Stacey also generated media interest.|$|R
5000|$|Federal Judge Tanya Pratt {{dismissed}} the suit against all three men. In 2013, Pratt {{dismissed the}} suit against Beth, ruling {{that he had}} no duty to care for Spierer. Spierer's parents had alleged in the suit that Beth had assumed [...] "duty of care" [...] for her when he offered her a place to sleep and then escorted her to Jason Rosenbam's apartment." [...] The judge said on public policy that it would dissuade people from rendering assistance to someone that's obviously sick {{on the side of the}} road, that's lost in the street," [...] said Beth's attorney Greg Garrison. [...] "You dissuade folks from being involved at all by punishing them if somebody decides later on that they didn't do enough." [...] In 2014, Judge Pratt dismissed the suit against the other two, stating: [...] "Unfortunately, there could be any number of theories as to what happened to Lauren and what, if any, injuries she may have sustained. Without evidence to prove these theories, it would be impossible for a jury to determine if whatever happened to Spierer was a natural and probable consequence of her intoxication, without any other <b>intervening</b> <b>acts</b> that would break the causal chain." [...] Spierer's parents have appealed the ruling.|$|R
25|$|Since 2012, German Lynx {{have been}} {{deployed}} routinely {{off the coast of}} Somalia to discourage and <b>intervene</b> against <b>acts</b> of piracy {{as a part of the}} multinational Operation Atalanta. In September 2014, 15 of the navy's 22-strong Sea Lynx Mk88A fleet were temporarily grounded following the discovery of fuselage cracks on some aircraft. The German Defense Ministry estimated that the Sea Lynx fleet will return to full strength in early 2015. In the long term, the German Navy is to retire the Super Lynx in favour of the larger and newer NHIndustries NH90.|$|R
5000|$|As we {{recently}} observed {{with respect to}} a determination of duty, however, [...] "foreseeability is a question of fact for the jury." [...] The same rule applies when the issue is whether the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> of a third person was foreseeable and therefore did not constitute a superseding cause: in such circumstances [...] "The foreseeability of the risk generally frames a question for the trier of fact" [...] Restatement the fact that the risk eventuates does not relieve him of responsibility.|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, {{the trial}} court in the case at bar could not {{properly}} rule {{as a matter of}} law that the defendants' negligence was not the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. Plaintiff is entitled to prove by expert testimony that defendants should reasonably have foreseen that her caretakers were likely to resume their physical abuse and inflict further injuries on her if she were returned directly to their custody. Again defendant Flood presses only a technical point of pleading, claiming the allegation of proximate cause is fatally defective because the foreseeability of the intervening conduct of plaintiff's mother and Reyes is not specifically set forth. It is asserted that under the case law such an allegation is mandatory if the foreseeability of the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> does not clearly appear from the pleaded facts of negligence and injury. [...] As shown above, however, here the occurrence of the <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> is the precise hazard to which defendants' conduct is alleged to have negligently exposed plaintiff, and the injuries pleaded are those which a reasonably prudent physician would have foreseen as likely to ensue from that negligence. In these circumstances [...] "The allegations of the complaint are sufficient to present the issue" [...] of proximate cause.|$|E
5000|$|Between the defendant's {{acts and}} the victim's harm, {{the chain of}} {{causation}} must be unbroken.

A mistake in medical treatment usually will not break the chain, unless the mistakes are in themselves [...] "so potent in causing death." [...] For instance, if emergency medics dropped a stab victim {{on the way to}} the hospital and performed the wrong resuscitation, the attacker would not be absolved of the crime.|$|E

50|$|Appellant minor argued {{trial court}} error in {{sustaining}} the demurrer of appellees, doctor and hospital, to her malpractice suit against them, because issues existed {{as to whether}} they had a duty to recognize a case of battered child syndrome that was to be reported to authorities, and whether their conduct proximately caused appellant's injuries. The court agreed, noting first that appellant was returned to parental custody after having been treated for injuries not appearing to be accidental, and that she then was traumatically abused. Because it was unclear whether treating physicians should have recognized the syndrome for treatment purposes, appellant was entitled to prove by expert testimony the standard of care against which appellees were to be held. And as appellees could not escape liability if it was foreseeable that appellant would suffer further injury, appellant was entitled to prove that appellees' conduct proximately caused her injuries, even if the parent's <b>intervening</b> <b>act</b> was the actual cause. Finally, appellant was entitled to show that appellees failed to exercise due care in not reporting her injuries to authorities who would have shielded her from further harm.|$|E

5000|$|Taint is a {{term used}} in the legal field with {{reference}} to evidence that has been [...] "tainted" [...] or ruined in some manner. The most common of such usage is with reference to evidence, testimony, identification by witnesses, or confessions that have been obtained by law enforcement illegally.

For example, the dissent in the Supreme Court decision of Missouri v. Seibert stated that [...] "the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time ..." [...] Missouri v.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the {{validity}} and applicability of medical negligence as a novus actus interveniens, with reference to recent South African criminal case law. Such an assessment necessitates an analysis of the most important rules pertaining to causation in South African criminal law. In the context of medical negligence as a new <b>intervening</b> <b>act,</b> reference is made to the influence of medical errors of judgement and the concept of medical misadventure. The judicial 'grading' of criminal medical negligence as 'gross' or 'overwhelming', with reference to relevant case law, is also explored and criticised. It is submitted that the courts should avoid 'grading' medical negligence by way of policy considerations to establish the absence of a novus actus interveniens. They should rather make a principled assessment of medical negligence, with due consideration to the concepts of medical misadventure and professional errors of judgement. More often than not, a principled assessment will lead to a finding that there was no medical negligence and consequently no novus actus interveniens, even in the face of adverse consequences...|$|E
