40|$|A {{floating}} solar chimney {{power station}} (FSCPS) has three major components: A circular solar collector A floating solar chimney {{in the center}} of the solar collector A set of air turbines geared to electric generators around the bottom of the solar chimney The efficiency of the FSCPSs is roughly proportional to the height of their floating solar chimneys. The floating solar chimneys (FSCs) are made by successive balloon tubes, that are filled with He or NH 3. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights a few Kms. In the present paper the effect on the FSCPS's operation of the thermal storage, due to ground or water in plastic bags or closed plastic tubes, is examined. It is shown that the FSCPSs equipped with thermal storage can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power</b> production. This means that the FSCPSs, although renewable by nature, have a similar operation to conventional power stations.

40|$|The {{selection}} of weak classifiers {{is critical to}} the success of boosting techniques. Poor weak classifiers do not perform better than random guess, thus cannot help decrease the training error during the boosting process. Therefore, when constructing the weak classifier pool, we prefer the quality rather than the quantity of the weak classifiers. In this paper, we present a data mining-driven approach to discovering compositional features from a given and possibly small feature pool. Compared with individual features (e. g. weak decision stumps) which are of limited discriminative ability, the mined compositional features have <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power</b> in terms of the descriptive and discriminative abilities, as well as bounded training error. To cope with the combinatorial cost of discovering compositional features, we apply data mining methods (frequent itemset mining) to efficiently find qualified compositional features of any possible order. These weak classifiers are further combined through a multi-class AdaBoost method for final multi-class classification. Experiments on a challenging 10 -class event recognition problem show that boosting compositional features can lead to faster decrease of training error and significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional boosting decision stumps. 1...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{installed}} capacity of wind turbines has increased rapidly, thereby raising the takes for wind turbine power performance testing. The current standard for power performance testing, IEC 61400 - 12 - 1, prescribes {{to measure the}} wind speed at hub height using a meteorological mast. This study tested whether Lidar, a remote measurement technology, could improve power performance testing. Potential benefits include mobility of the measurement device and increased insight in wind speed, with measurements up to approximately 200 meter height. A measurement campaign was held at a site with flat terrain by positioning a ZephIR 300 Lidar next to an IEC compliant meteorological mast to measure the power performance of two wind turbines. Wind speed measurements were compliant to Norsewind criteria with a linear regression slope of 0. 989 indicating that the Lidar measured lower wind speeds than the meteorological mast. Three major conclusions were drawn. (I) The difference in wind speed measurement has a large effect on annual energy production estimation (2. 5 % for a Rayleigh function with a mean annual wind speed of 7 m/s), but difference in power performance of two wind turbines was found by either using the meteorological mast or the Lidar. (II) The rotor equivalent wind speed approach reduced scatter in the power curve for the Lidar compared to hub height wind speed, but not compared to hub height wind speed measurement by the meteorological mast. (III) Inner- and inner+outer envelope <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power</b> curve conditions showed a difference in annual energy production of approximately 1 % for a Rayleigh function with a mean annual wind speed of 7 m/s. The most important implications are the following. (I) It is advized to use a Lidar to compare the power performance of multiple wind turbines or {{to use it for}} comparing performance over time, but it is advised not compare power performance measured for one test with a Lidar and for another test using a meteorological mast. (II) For power performance guarantee negotiations Lidar measurements could be included as option for power performance measurement and with REWS calculations the inner envelop conditions could be enlarged, but a different <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power</b> curve than when measured using a meteorological mast might be needed. (III) For flat terrain with grassland and wind turbines of approximately 100 meter hub height, rotor equivalent wind speed and veer calculations are not adding much insight and are not needed for inclusion in the power performance testing, except when used for extending inner envelope conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a techno-economic {{comparison}} of an {{energy storage system}} (ESS) sizing for three intermittent renewables, wind, wave and PV power, with regard to two electricity grid services is presented. The first service consists of output hourly smoothing, based on day-ahead power forecasts (S 1). The second service supplies year-round <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power</b> (S 2). This leads to an annual default time rate (DTR) for which the actual power supplied to the grid does not match the day-ahead power bid within a given tolerance. A heuristic optimization based on an Adaptive Storage Operation (ASO) scheduling is developed in this study. ASO enables the minimal 5 %-DTR ESS capacity, power, energy and feed-in-tariffs to be inferred from the operating conditions, depending on tolerance. The simulations assess and compare the techno-economic viability and efficiency of every renewable sources coupled with ESS. PV power is more efficient with daylight hours restricted services and higher power levels can be guaranteed for S 1. Wind and wave power are more suitable than PV for services dedicated to full-day power delivery, {{as in the case}} of S 2. For hourly smoothing the forecast accuracy influence is studied and yields a high impact on techno-economic sizing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Power {{is one of}} the {{fundamentals}} in developing and developed nations world-wide. Over 80 % of the world’s population does not have reliable power. Without <b>guaranteed</b> <b>power,</b> nations quickly lose capabilities, efficiencies, and other critical infrastructure to their people and livelihood. The barrier for reliable power, in the past was the large investment requirement for centralized bulk generation. Additionally, the belief was that without large centralized power, the nation would not get efficiencies needed to provide reliable power. Across the world today, still many countries have inconsistent power and see rolling brown or black outs hourly or daily. At best developed countries have, reliable and secure power that is centrally managed through a bulk power grid and sometime governed by central government or large corporations. However with the advancement of distributed generation, substation automation, Microgrid (“MG”) control software, the industry is going through a fundamental change. The change is bringing on smaller Microgrid pockets, smaller generation due with less capital investment, and higher efficiency solutions that can compete neck and neck with large bulk generation. All of these items, while critical for the new “World Power Infrastructure” still lack some basic building blocks for the transformation to take its final shape. This paper will describe some of the concepts, barriers, lessons learned, and next steps to move from eithe...|$|E
