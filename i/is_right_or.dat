5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E

They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told {{that they can have}} their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} scholarly {{discussion of}} sati, whether it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong, {{is found in}} the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati.|$|E

Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.|$|E
500|$|Justice David J. Brewer {{issued a}} dissent stating that he {{believed}} that due process had been observed and that the majority opinion should have affirmed the lower court rulings rather than dismissing the case. In his opinion, Brewer stated: [...] "s I understand the law, this court has jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a State ousting one from his office and giving it to another, and a right to inquire whether that judgment <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong in respect to any federal question such as due process of law, I think the writ of error should not be dismissed, but that {{the judgment of the}} Court of Appeals of Kentucky should be affirmed." [...] Justice Henry B. Brown concurred with Brewer.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Whether the {{isosceles}} triangle <b>is</b> acute, <b>right</b> <b>or</b> obtuse {{depends on the}} vertex angle. In Euclidean geometry, the base angles cannot be obtuse (greater than 90°) <b>or</b> <b>right</b> (equal to 90°) because their measures would sum to at least 180°, the total of all angles in any Euclidean triangle. Since a triangle <b>is</b> obtuse <b>or</b> <b>right</b> {{if and only if}} one of its angles <b>is</b> obtuse <b>or</b> <b>right,</b> respectively, an {{isosceles triangle}} <b>is</b> obtuse, <b>right</b> <b>or</b> acute if and only if its vertex angle <b>is</b> respectively obtuse, <b>right</b> <b>or</b> acute.|$|R

500|$|The concerts were a {{considerable}} financial outlay for Bache, {{who did not}} have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to [...] "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow <b>is</b> <b>right).</b> <b>Or</b> shall I make my own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening." [...] Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, [...] "For years [...] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" [...] Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was [...] "a just recompense" [...] and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons {{at the same rate as}} the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{explores the}} {{differences}} in scientific and religious perspectives by presenting the two sides as competing modes of discourse; Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club argues that magic users, such as Jake, stand [...] "for magic and the wonderful unknown", whereas Bubblegum stands for [...] "cold, hard facts". While Bubblegum is resistant to embrace magical ways of thinking, by the episode's end, she realizes that [...] "magic has its uses". Moynihan later noted on his personal website that, [...] "in helping to write the episode, it wasn’t important (for me) to impart an idea of who <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong about magic and science {{in the land of}} Ooo. It was important to impart the idea of a complex and contradictory fantasy." [...] He later argued that using the [...] "science v. religion" [...] debate to backdrop an episode was enjoyable because it allowed him to have [...] "fun with both sides of the perspective spectrum." [...] Likewise, Wellmann thought the show's willingness to explore weighty subjects is one of the ways the show has been so successful. He wrote, [...] "one of the biggest strengths of Adventure Time [...] that it’s bold to explore topics like [...] science v. religion in a non-judging, open-minded way." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the basis}} that it is always assumed, by {{statistical}} convention, that the speculated hypothesis is wrong, and the so-called [...] "null hypothesis" [...] that the observed phenomena simply occur by chance (and that, as a consequence, the speculated agent has no effect)– the test will determine whether this hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong. This is why the hypothesis under test is often called the null hypothesis (most likely, coined by Fisher (1935, p.19)), because it is this hypothesis {{that is to be}} either nullified or not nullified by the test. When the null hypothesis is nullified, it is possible to conclude that data support the [...] "alternative hypothesis" [...] (which is the original speculated one).|$|E
2500|$|Four {{months after}} Elbegdorj's {{announcement}} of a moratorium of death penalty by his pardon, a survey was conducted among Mongolian legal academics asking whether it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong to abolish death penalty in Mongolia. 83% of the survey participants responded that it was wrong.

[...] According to Article 33.1.8 of the Constitution, the Mongolian president has the prerogative [...] "to grant pardon."

2500|$|The {{following}} example {{describes the}} short sale of a security. To profit from {{a decrease in the}} price of a security, a short seller can borrow the security and sell it expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. [...] When the seller decides that the time <b>is</b> <b>right</b> (<b>or</b> when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. [...] The process relies {{on the fact that the}} securities (or the other assets being sold short) are fungible; the term [...] "borrowing" [...] is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a car, where the same car must be returned).|$|E
2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century {{study was conducted}} with less bias than Gould had described; that [...] "contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's research was conducted with integrity". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he [...] "cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> the other side is right, and I think that is a mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chamberlain's Men {{comprised}} a core {{of eight}} [...] "sharers," [...] who split profits and debts; perhaps {{an equal number of}} hired men who acted minor and doubled parts; and a slightly smaller number of boy players, who were sometimes bound apprentices to an adult actor. The original sharers in the Chamberlain's were eight. Probably the most famous in the mid-1590s was William Kempe, {{who had been in the}} company of the Earl of Leicester in the 1580s, and had later joined the King's Men. As the company's clown, he presumably took the broadest comic role in every play; he is identified with Peter in the quarto of Romeo and Juliet, and probably also originated Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing and Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Kempe has traditionally been viewed as the object of Hamlet's complaint about extemporising clowns; whether this association <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>or</b> wrong, Kempe had left the company by 1601. Another two sharers from Strange's Men had a long-standing association with Kempe. George Bryan had been in Leicester's Men in the 1580s, and at Elsinore with Kempe in 1586; because he is not mentioned in later Chamberlain's or King's Men documents, it is assumed that Bryan retired from the stage in 1597 or 1598. (Bryan lived on for some years; in the reign of James, he is listed as a Groom of the Chamber, with household duties, as late as 1613.) Thomas Pope, another Leicester's veteran, retired in 1600 and died in 1603. Both Bryan and Pope came to the company from Lord Strange's Men.|$|E
