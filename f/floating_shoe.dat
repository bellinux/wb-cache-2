5000|$|There {{has been}} {{widespread}} criticism {{of how the}} police handled the crime scene. Misskelley's former attorney Dan Stidham cites multiple substantial police errors at the crime scene, characterizing it as [...] "literally trampled, especially the creek bed." [...] The bodies, he said, {{had been removed from}} the water before the coroner arrived to examine the scene and determine the state of rigor mortis, allowing the bodies to decay on the creek bank and to be exposed to sunlight and insects. The police did not telephone the coroner until almost two hours after the discovery of the <b>floating</b> <b>shoe,</b> resulting in a late appearance by the coroner. Officials failed to drain the creek in a timely manner and secure possible evidence in the water (the creek was sandbagged after the bodies were pulled from the water).|$|E
50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A <b>floating</b> <b>shoe</b> gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the main longitudinal chassis members). Front brake adjustment is carried out by jacking up that end of the car and the hand operated nuts turned until equal pressure is provided to each wheel. The following year a compensating device is installed between the two sets of brakes.|$|E
50|$|Guide {{shoes are}} {{a variant of}} a <b>float</b> <b>shoe</b> without a check valve.|$|R
5000|$|A rounded profile <b>float</b> <b>shoe</b> with an {{integral}} check valve attached {{to the bottom of}} a casing string prevents reverse flow, or U-tubing, of cement slurry from the annulus into the casing or flow of wellbore fluids into the casing string as it is run. The <b>float</b> <b>shoe</b> also guides the casing {{toward the center of the}} hole to minimize hitting rock ledges or washouts as the casing is run into the wellbore. By [...] "floating" [...] casing in, hook weight is reduced. With controlled or partial fill-up as the string is run, the casing string can be floated into position, precluding the need for the rig to carry the entire weight of the casing string. The outer portions of the <b>float</b> <b>shoe</b> are made of steel and generally match the casing size and threads, although not necessarily the casing grade. The inside (including the external taper) is usually made of cement or thermoplastic, since this material must be drilled out if the well is to be deepened beyond the casing point.|$|R
50|$|Casing will be {{installed}} at various depths while drilling. It {{is held in}} place by cement, which also provides zone isolation. Down-hole equipment such as Centralizers and Turbolizers are used to ensure obtaining satisfactory zone isolation. <b>Float</b> <b>Shoes</b> and Collars (<b>float</b> valves) prevent backflow after the cement has been pumped into place.|$|R
50|$|The {{check-valve}} assembly fixed {{within the}} float collar prevents flow {{back of the}} cement slurry when pumping is stopped. Without a float collar or <b>float</b> <b>shoe,</b> the cement slurry placed in the annulus could U-tube, or reverse flow back into the casing. The greater density of cement slurries than the displacement mud inside the casing causes the U-tube effect.|$|R
5000|$|Reuben Carlton [...] "Carl" [...] Baker, Sr. (July 18, 1872 - September 29, 1957) was an American oil {{industry}} drilling pioneer. He established {{the forerunner of}} Baker International (ultimately Baker Hughes) in 1907 after developing a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling. In 1903, he introduced the offset bit for cable tool drilling to enable casing wells in hard rock and in 1912 the cement retainer that allowed casing to be cemented in the wells. Baker further improved the process with the <b>float</b> <b>shoe</b> in 1923. He is credited with obtaining more than 150 new or improved patents on oil drilling tools.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the treasures of the oni in the later tale of Momotarō incorporated this older lore about treasures the ogres possessed. It {{has been observed}} that {{the same set of}} treasures as Momotarō's oni, or practically so, are described in The Tale of Hōgen, regarding Minamoto no Tametomo traveling to Onigashima island. Tametomo discovers that the islanders claimed to be descendants of oni, and named their now-lost treasures as the [...] "cloak of invisibility, the hat of invisibility, <b>floating</b> <b>shoes,</b> sinking shoes, and sword" [...] in some texts, and in older variant texts (Nakai codex group) one treasure is uchide no kutsu (shoes of wishing), a likely scribal error for uchide no kozuchi according to scholars.|$|R
5000|$|In {{this stage}} the player {{can not use}} any mega cards, but they would gain skills such as a barrier that generates every turn. The rogue form also has no element, meaning it cannot be lost due to element {{advantages}}. Boosts from the tribe on form are also lost, instead, cards that deal 'sword' damage get a +50 attack Boost. The wave command way has the advantages over the original version as it gets certain bonuses, such as a large HP boost, Max Buster stats, Giga+1, and the Auto-ability waves First Barrier, <b>Float</b> <b>Shoes,</b> and Undershirt. You also get to keep your brotherbands. However, their power-ups are disabled {{as if you are}} in Rogue form, but turning off the ability gives them back. When you are in rogue form, your brotherbands with your friends will end. The main difference between the two versions is the Indie Frag Rogue Form can be activated on your on will, using it as a strategical advantage (such as burning your mega cards). The Wave command starts you off in Rogue Tribe, meaning Mega cards aren't usable no matter what (as the form cannot be lost prematurely in battle) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot by}} {{director}} Shūichi Banba (番場秀一). It begins with a red <b>shoe</b> <b>floating</b> in space. The scene changes to Chara singing in a forest. She begins to grow, and sings {{in places such as}} a high branch or above the forest, getting increasingly larger. She eventually breaks through the clouds and dances on different planets. She loses her shoes as she jumps from a planet, and disintegrates into hundreds of stars. She wakes up in a hole in the forest, with a boy in clothes far too large for him. The scene pans out, and it is shown that the hole is the heel print from one of her missing shoes.|$|R
50|$|Around 1:45 pm, {{juvenile}} Parole Officer Steve Jones {{spotted a}} boy's black <b>shoe</b> <b>floating</b> in a muddy creek {{that led to}} a major drainage canal in Robin Hood Hills. A subsequent search of the ditch revealed the bodies of three boys. They had been stripped naked and were hogtied with their own shoelaces: their right ankles tied to their right wrists behind their backs, the same with their left arms and legs. Their clothing was found in the creek, some of it twisted around sticks that had been thrust into the muddy ditch bed. The clothing was mostly turned inside-out; two pairs of the boys' underwear were never recovered. Christopher Byers had lacerations to various parts of his body, and mutilation of his scrotum and penis.|$|R
60|$|A jay-bird-blue tennis suit {{covered him}} outwardly, almost {{as far as}} his wrists and ankles. His shirt was ox-blood; his collar winged and tall; his necktie a <b>floating</b> oriflamme; his <b>shoes</b> a venomous bright tan, pointed and shaped on penitential lasts. A little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather-beaten head. Lemon-coloured kid gloves {{protected}} his oak-tough hands from the benignant May sunshine. This sad and optic-smiting creature teetered out of its den, smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see. To such a pass had Dry Valley Johnson been brought by Cupid, who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of Momus. Reconstructing mythology, he had risen, a prismatic macaw, from the ashes of the grey-brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of Santa Rosa.|$|R
5000|$|Ebbesmeyer {{was born}} April 24, 1943 in Los Angeles, California. Educated at the University of Washington, where he gained a Ph.D. in {{oceanography}} in 1973, Ebbesmeyer monitored ocean currents by tracking buoys and markers dropped at sea. Stories vary {{as to the}} origin of Ebbesmeyer's use of flotsam as markers. In May 1990 80,000 Nike sneakers were released from a container washed off the ship Hansa Carrier. When Ebbesmeyer's mother heard about those <b>shoes</b> <b>floating</b> in the currents she said: [...] "Well isn't that what you do?" [...] He says that from this he saw the opportunity to monitor ocean currents from {{the distribution of the}} shoes washing up on the coasts of Oregon and Washington. However, in a 1999 article, Ebbesmeyer credits the discovery by Richard Strickland, a colleague at the University of Washington School of Oceanography, of a Chinese message in a bottle, which Strickland opened in 1991 having found it in June the previous year. Ebbesmeyer and his team calculated that the bottle had been released {{on the other side of}} the Pacific in 1980.|$|R
6000|$|So the boy thanked her, and he {{fastened}} on the Shoes of Swiftness, {{and turned}} to say good-by {{to the young man}} and the lady. But, behold! they had vanished, he knew not how or where! Then he leaped in the air to try the Shoes of Swiftness, and they carried him more swiftly than the wind, over the warm blue sea, over the happy lands of the south, over the northern peoples who drank mare's milk and lived in great wagons, wandering after their flocks. Across the wide rivers, where the wild fowl rose and fled before him, and over the plains and the cold North Sea he went, over the fields of snow and the hills of ice, to a place where the world ends, and all water is frozen, and there are no men, nor beasts, nor any green grass. There in a blue cave of the ice he found the Three Gray Sisters, the oldest of living things. Their hair was as white as the snow, and their flesh of an icy blue, and they mumbled and nodded in a kind of dream, and their frozen breath hung round them like a cloud. Now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow, and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the Gray Sisters. But, <b>floating</b> on the <b>Shoes</b> of Swiftness, the boy just managed to steal in, and waited till one of the sisters said to another, who had their one eye: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He sat in it, as I've told you, on his tin box, nursing the {{unloaded}} revolver on his lap. He {{sat with}} precaution--than {{which there is}} nothing more fatiguing--and thus entered the land he was destined to fill with the fame of his virtues, from the blue peaks inland to the white ribbon of surf on the coast. At the first bend he lost sight of the sea with its labouring waves for ever rising, sinking, and vanishing to rise again--the very image of struggling mankind--and faced the immovable forests rooted deep in the soil, soaring towards the sunshine, everlasting in the shadowy might of their tradition, like life itself. And his opportunity sat veiled by his side like an Eastern bride waiting to be uncovered by the hand of the master. He too was the heir of a shadowy and mighty tradition! He told me, however, that he had never in his life felt so depressed and tired as in that canoe. All the movement he dared to allow himself was to reach, as it were by stealth, after the shell of half a cocoa-nut <b>floating</b> between his <b>shoes,</b> and bale some of the water out with a carefully restrained action. He discovered how hard the lid of a block-tin case was to sit upon. He had heroic health; but several times during that journey he experienced fits of giddiness, and between whiles he speculated hazily as {{to the size of the}} blister the sun was raising on his back. For amusement he tried by looking ahead to decide whether the muddy object he saw lying on the water's edge was a log of wood or an alligator. Only very soon he had to give that up. No fun in it. Always alligator. One of them flopped into the river and all but capsized the canoe. But this excitement was over directly. Then in a long empty reach he was very grateful to a troop of monkeys who came right down on the bank and made an insulting hullabaloo on his passage. Such was the way in which he was approaching greatness as genuine as any man ever achieved. Principally, he longed for sunset; and meantime his three paddlers were preparing to put into execution their plan of delivering him up to the Rajah.|$|R
