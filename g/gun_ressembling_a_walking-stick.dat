60|$|Syme also strolled {{across to}} the table, and found lying across it <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick,</b> which turned out on {{examination}} to be a sword-stick, a large Colt's revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of brandy.

60|$|I was {{certainly}} off my balance, a prey to impulse, {{for at the}} bottom of the stairs I turned and flung myself at the doorway of Mr. Burns' cabin. The wildness of his aspect checked my mental disorder. He was sitting up in his bunk, his body looking immensely long, his head drooping a little sideways, with affected complacency. He flourished, in his trembling hand, on the end of a forearm no thicker than <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick,</b> <b>a</b> shining pair of scissors which he tried before my very eyes to jab at his throat.|$|R
40|$|A {{branch of}} uniformly-propagating solitary waves of planar ferromagnets is identified. The energy {{dispersion}} and {{structures of the}} solitary waves are determined for an isotropic ferromagnet as functions of a conserved momentum. With increasing momentum, their structure undergoes a transition from <b>a</b> form <b>ressembling</b> <b>a</b> droplet of spin-waves to a Skyrmion/anti-Skyrmion pair.

60|$|For example, {{the hairs}} and nails are utterly devoid of sensibility, as {{everyone}} knows. Nevertheless, if {{the ends of}} the nails or hairs are touched, ever so lightly, we feel that they are touched, and the sensation seems to be situated in the nails or hairs. Nay more, if <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> <b>a</b> yard long is held firmly by the handle and the other end is touched, the tactile sensation, which is a state of our own consciousness, is unhesitatingly referred {{to the end of the}} stick; and yet no one will say that it is there.|$|R

He obeyed his master's mandate by sitting down on a tall stool near the window, and occupied himself in attempting to carve a human face {{on the head of}} <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick.</b>|$|R

60|$|He took a green hazel {{which he}} had used as <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick,</b> split it at the end, {{inserted}} a small pebble, and with the lantern in his hand {{went out into the}} heath. Clym had by this time lit a small fire, and despatched Susan Nunsuch for a frying-pan. Before she had returned Sam came in with three adders, one briskly coiling and uncoiling in the cleft of the stick, and the other two hanging dead across it.|$|R
60|$|Dick sat down. The talking progressed very favourably, {{amid the}} snipping and sewing, till about half-past two, {{at which time}} his {{conversation}} began to be varied by a slight tapping upon his toe with <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> he had cut from the hedge as he came along. Fancy talked and answered him, but sometimes the answers were so negligently given, that it was evident her thoughts lay for the greater part in her lap with the blue dress.|$|R
60|$|The first intimation Mike had of {{this was}} a violent blow across the {{shoulders}} with <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick.</b> Even {{if he had been}} wearing his overcoat, the blow would have hurt. As he was in his jacket it hurt more than anything he had ever experienced in his life. He leapt up with a yell, but Psmith was there before him. Mike saw his assailant lift the stick again, and then collapse as the old Etonian's right took him under the chin.|$|R
60|$|Buoys.--An {{excellent}} buoy to {{mark out}} a passage is simply a small pole anchored by a rope at the end. It is very readily seen, and exposes so little surface to the wind and water, {{that it is not}} easily washed away. A pole of the thickness of <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> is much used in Sweden. Such a buoy costs only a rope, a stick, and a stone. A tuft of the small-branches may be left {{on the top of the}} pole.|$|R
50|$|Around 400 {{works for}} the csakan were {{published}} {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, mainly for csakan solo, csakan duet or csakan with guitar or piano. The csakan's repertoire has not yet been fully explored. Notable composers for the instrument include Heberle and Krähmer, and Tarasov notes that piano works by Beethoven were arranged for csakan and guitar (Beethoven is reported to have owned <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> csakan). Modern recorder makers such as Bernhard Mollenhauer and Martin Wenner have made csakan copies.|$|R

60|$|I {{can only}} put it {{sufficiently}} curtly in a careless simile. A Socialist means {{a man who}} thinks <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> like <b>an</b> umbrella because they both go into the umbrella-stand. Yet they are as different as a battle-ax and a bootjack. The essential idea of an umbrella is breadth and protection. The essential idea of a stick is slenderness and, partly, attack. The stick is the sword, the umbrella is the shield, {{but it is a}} shield against another and more nameless enemy--the hostile but anonymous universe. More properly, therefore, the umbrella is the roof; {{it is a kind of}} collapsible house. But the vital difference goes far deeper than this; it branches off into two kingdoms of man's mind, with a chasm between. For the point is this: that the umbrella is a shield against an enemy so actual as to be a mere nuisance; whereas the stick is a sword against enemies so entirely imaginary as to be a pure pleasure. The stick is not merely a sword, but a court sword; it is a thing of purely ceremonial swagger. One cannot express the emotion in any way except by saying that a man feels more like a man with a stick in his hand, just as he feels more like a man with a sword at his side. But nobody ever had any swelling sentiments about an umbrella; it is a convenience, like a door scraper. An umbrella is a necessary evil. <b>A</b> <b>walking-stick</b> is <b>a</b> quite unnecessary good. This, I fancy, is the real explanation of the perpetual losing of umbrellas; one does not hear of people losing walking sticks. For <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> is <b>a</b> pleasure, a piece of real personal property; it is missed even when it is not needed. When my right hand forgets its stick may it forget its cunning. But anybody may forget an umbrella, as anybody might forget a shed that he has stood up in out of the rain. Anybody can forget a necessary thing.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} {{also that}} the hall called Aar was a long house roofed with sods, on which grew grass and sometimes little white flowers, and that inside of it cows were tied up. We lived in a place beyond, that was separated off from the cows by balks of rough timber. I used to watch them being milked through a crack {{between two of the}} balks where a knot had fallen out, leaving a convenient eyehole about the height of <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> from the floor.|$|R

"If I wasn't as weak as a {{brimstone}} baby, sir," [...] whispers Grandfather Smallweed, {{drawing the}} lawyer {{down to his}} level by the lapel of his coat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of his angry eyes, [...] "I'd tear the writing away from him.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on several {{anomalies}} in quantum transport at the band center of a bipartite lattice with vacancies that are surely due to its chiral symmetry, namely: no weak localization effect shows up, and, when leads have a single channel the transmission is either one or zero. We propose that these are a consequence of both the chiral symmetry and {{the large number of}} states at the band center. The probability amplitude associated to the eigenstate that gives unit transmission <b>ressembles</b> <b>a</b> classical trajectory both with or without vacancies. The large number of states allows to build up trajectories that elude the blocking vacancies explaining the absence of weak localization. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

60|$|As Miggs, however, was deaf to all entreaties, Mr Tappertit leant {{her against}} the wall as one might dispose of <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> or umbrella, until he had secured the window, when he took {{her in his arms}} again, and, in short stages and with great difficulty--arising from her being tall and his being short, and perhaps in some degree from that {{peculiar}} physical conformation on which he had already remarked--carried her upstairs, and planting her, in the same umbrella and walking-stick fashion, just inside her own door, left her to her repose.|$|R
60|$|From those {{peaceful}} homes, and {{the envy}} they inspire (two trunks and <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> and <b>a</b> bit of pine forest in British Columbia are not satisfactory, {{any way you}} look at them), I turned me to the lake front of Buffalo, where the steamers bellow to the grain elevators, and the locomotives yell to the coal-shutes, and the canal barges jostle the lumber-raft half a mile long as it snakes across the water in tow of a launch, and earth, and sky, and sea alike are thick with smoke.|$|R
60|$|Within a few months, however, it {{made its}} {{appearance}} at a shop in Boston, before the door of which was seen a striped pole.

In short, it was a barber's shop, kept by a Mr. Pierce, who prided himself on having shaved General Washington, Old Put, and many other famous persons.|$|R
60|$|It {{is hard to}} astonish {{the waiters}} at a New York restaurant, but when the cat {{performed}} this feat there was a squeal of surprise all round the room.

60|$|A novel {{attraction}} {{about this}} young man, which a glancing stranger would know nothing of, {{was a rare}} and curious freshness of atmosphere that appertained to him, to his clothes, to all his belongings, even to the room {{in which he had}} been sitting. It might almost have been said that by adding him and his implements to an over-crowded apartment you made it healthful. This resulted from his trade. He was a lime-burner; he handled lime daily; and in return the lime rendered him an incarnation of salubrity. His hair was dry, fair, and frizzled, the latter possibly by the operation of the same caustic agent. He carried as <b>a</b> <b>walking-stick</b> <b>a</b> green sapling, whose growth had been contorted to a corkscrew pattern by a twining honeysuckle.|$|R
