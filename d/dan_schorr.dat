5000|$|According to a Westchester County medical examiner, {{the crash}} was ruled a {{homicide}} soon after it occurred because {{the victims were}} killed because of Schuler's driving, regardless of toxicology findings. On August 18, Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said that no charges would be filed in the incident, as Schuler {{was the only person}} responsible. [...] "Diane Schuler died in the crash and the charges died with her," [...] DiFiore said. In October 2009, DiFiore faced accusations that she had mishandled the Schuler case from <b>Dan</b> <b>Schorr,</b> a Republican challenger for her office, as well as from an attorney for the Bastardi family. Both parties said that DiFiore should have initiated a grand jury investigation into the incident. In response to Schorr's comments, DiFiore responded, [...] "Is he suggesting that there was criminal evidence of a crime committed by someone and we wouldn't pursue it? That's just silly." [...] DiFiore won re-election in November with 53 percent of the vote to Schorr's 36 percent. The Bastardi family said that if DiFiore did not convene a grand jury, they would seek support in the matter from the state attorney general and the governor.|$|E
