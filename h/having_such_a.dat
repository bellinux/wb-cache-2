25|$|Because swarm-founding colonies {{can contain}} {{more than one}} {{egg-laying}} queen, they tend to challenge the kin selection theory and typically do not meet Hamilton’s rule of haplodiploid species mentioned in the introduction. In comparison to other swarm-founding species, these theories are challenged further in R. romandi. R. romandi colonies are extremely large, and can have an average of up to 400 queens at any one time. The average for other swarm-founding species is only around 20 queens. <b>Having</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large number of queens decreases the genetic relatedness within the nest. Workers in R. romandi have a genetic relatedness of only 0.16, and queens have a genetic relatedness of only 0.34. The next lowest genetic relatedness among a swarm founding species is found in Polybia emaciata 's 0.24 among workers and 0.55 among queens. These numbers indicate a large deviation from Hamilton’s ¾ rule. Independent-founding species, with fewer queens, {{are much more likely}} to be more genetically related.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Banco de Mexico {{began the}} gradual {{launch of a}} new series of {{bimetallic}} $100 coins. These number 32 – one for each of the nation's 31 states, plus the Federal District. While the obverse of these coins bears the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, their reverses show the individual coats of arms of the component states. The first states to be celebrated in this fashion were Zacatecas, Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala. In circulation they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users feel at <b>having</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for the purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold, instead of aluminium bronze.|$|E
