25|$|The rupee coin {{has been}} used since then, even during British India, when it {{contained}} 11.66g (1tola) of 91.7% silver with an ASW of 0.3437 of a troy ounce (that is, silver worth about US$10 at modern prices). At {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Indian silver rupee went onto a <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standard</b> at a fixed rate of one rupee to one shilling and fourpence in British currency, i.e. 15 rupees to 1 pound sterling.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the silver}} {{devaluation}} of 1873, the yen devalued against the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar (since those two countries adhered to a gold standard), {{and by the}} year 1897, the yen was worth only about US$0.50. In that year, Japan adopted a <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standard</b> and hence froze {{the value of the}} yen at $0.50. This exchange rate remained in place until Japan left the gold standard in December 1931, after which the yen fell to $0.30 by July 1932 and to $0.20 by 1933. It remained steady at around $0.30 until the start of the Second World War on December 7, 1941, at which time it fell to $0.23.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, there was no single {{currency}} in use in Macau, but the predominant circulating coins were the silver Mexican dollars, the British silver trade dollars of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, as well as the silver dollars and fractional coinage of the neighbouring province of Canton. In 1901, it was decided to have a uniquely Macau currency, and for that purpose, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino was granted exclusive rights to issue legal tender banknotes that were to be denominated in patacas. On January 27, 1906, pataca notes in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 were introduced and all foreign coinage was outlawed, the idea being to make the pataca paper notes the sole legal tender currency in Macau. However, the Chinese, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, were suspicious of this new paper money, and as such, the paper pataca always circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. On the contrary, a similar action at exactly the same time in the Straits Settlements, and for the same purpose, had the different effect of putting the new Straits dollar into the <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standard.</b> Hence both the Macau pataca and the Straits dollar were launched at a sterling value of 2 shillings and 4 pence, but where the Straits dollar remained at that value until the 1960s, the Macau pataca fluctuated with the value of silver, just like the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wars {{have been}} the main forces shaping the {{international}} trading system in the twentieth century. The {{early years of the}} twentieth century were dominated by the international gold standard. But as a result of World War I, this system was replaced by the troubled <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standards</b> of the 1920 s and 1930 s. As a result of World War II the interwar system was replaced in turn by the Bretton Woods system. And as a result of inflation of the late 1960 s, produced in part by America's war in Vietnam, the Bretton Woods system was replaced by the current system of flexible exchange rates. The European monetary union was a response to German reunification and the perceived need to defuse potential conflicts through a high level of economic cooperation. war, finance, globalization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} two periods: before {{socialism and}} after it. The former includes the 1920 s, 1930 s, and 1940 s, {{and the second}} includes the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The focus is on issues of economic reconstruction, hyperinflation, integration with the global monetary system and {{the functioning of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standards,</b> the impact of the great depression ofthe 1930 s and its aftermath, and postwar monetary reforms. The study also compares per capita income and the structure of foreign trade of East-Central Europe with those of Western Europe and Latin America in the late 1930 s and the late 1980 s. Economic transformation in East-Central Europe probably will be a long and complicated process because the initial conditions for the transition to a market economy are very weak. In fact, the chief characteristics of these economies are macroeconomic imbalances, obsolete and uncompetitive productive capacities, a lack of modern infrastructure, underdeveloped factor markets, and weak institutions. On the political side, the initial euphoria over the end of the old regime is waning and people are less enthusiastic about reform because of the hardships accompanying the transition. Fragile and changing political coalitions and the signs of some surrender to the temptations of populism clearly reflect that tendency.

50|$|By 1895, the {{circumstances}} had changed {{to the extent}} that there was now a dearth of Mexican dollars and the authorities in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements were putting pressure on the authorities in London to take measures to have a regular supply of silver dollar coins. London eventually acquiesced and legislation was enacted in attempts to regulate the coinage. New British trade dollars were coined at the mints in Calcutta and Bombay for use in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. In 1906, the Straits Settlements issued their own silver dollar coin and attached it to a <b>gold</b> sterling <b>exchange</b> <b>standard</b> at a fixed value of 2 shillings and 4 pence. This was the point of departure as between the Hong Kong unit and the Straits unit.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1873, {{the silver}} dollar {{circulated}} {{in many parts}} of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold sovereign of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a 'de facto' gold standard. Canada and Newfoundland were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a <b>gold</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>standard</b> in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) sterling, whereas the Hong Kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).|$|E
2500|$|On August 15, 1971, the United States {{unilaterally}} {{pulled out}} of the Bretton Woods Accord.

Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of thedollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.|$|E

At the time the soon to be defeated powers of Germany and Japan were envisaged as states soon to be in need of such development, and there was a desire from both the US and Britain not to see the defeated powers saddled with punitive sanctions that would inflict lasting pain on future generations. The new exchange rate system allowed countries facing economic hardship to devalue their currencies by up to 10% against the dollar (more if approved by the IMF) – thus they would not be forced to undergo deflation to stay in the gold standard. A system of capital controls was introduced to protect countries from the damaging effects of capital flight and to allow countries to pursue independent macro economic policies ...|$|R
