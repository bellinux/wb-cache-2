5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack}} of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a consensus that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the animal's claws, and to Tiger's head; then to {{the bloody}} spear which lay at his side, and to the jaguar's blood-stained throat, after which <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his own breast and nodded again.|$|R

25|$|Dr Swinburn also {{believes}} {{the views of}} scientists are being suppressed by attack campaigns driven by large commercial interests in New Zealand. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Tony Ryall's dismissal of a letter from more than 30 senior public-health experts calling for an investigation of Rich's role on the HPA board.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil next {{writes about}} {{creating}} a digital brain inspired by the biological brain he has been describing. One existing effort <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> is Henry Markram's Blue Brain Project, which is attempting to create a full brain simulation by 2023. Kurzweil says the full molecular modeling they are attempting will be too slow, {{and that they will}} have to swap in simplified models to speed up initial self-organization.|$|E
25|$|Sverdlov {{approaches}} the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words {{can take the}} form of a genitive or a bare root, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{presents}} a more pancultural {{view of the}} cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|Steiner then {{argues that}} inner freedom is {{achieved}} when we {{bridge the gap}} between our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, and our thoughts, which give us access to the inner nature of the world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choice, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the impact of our becoming aware of just these determinants. Outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with moral imagination. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.|$|E
25|$|First, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> {{economic}} freedom. One of {{the common}} threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty. On this, {{there is not a}} ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer {{asserts that}} China's rise {{will not be}} {{peaceful}} and that the U.S. will seek to contain China and prevent it from achieving regional hegemony. He believes that China will attempt to dominate the Asia-Pacific region just as, he asserts, the U.S. set out to dominate the western hemisphere. The motivation for doing so would be to gain a position of overwhelming security and superiority against its neighbors which it sees as potential challengers to its status. Additionally, he maintains that the U.S. will attempt to form a balancing coalition that consists primarily of India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia to counter the growing strength and power projection capabilities of China. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> increased alliances and warming U.S.–Vietnam and U.S.–India relations as evidence of this.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this theory}} {{is no longer}} accepted. In 1989, Egyptologist Nabil Swelim {{examined}} the pyramid more precisely {{and found that it}} was made of small mud bricks, with a quarter of its inner core hewn out of a natural bedrock. The rock core itself contained several rock-cut tombs dating back to the 5th and 6th dynasty. Swelim and others Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson, point out that it would be surprising for a royal pyramid to have been completely destroyed less than 300 years after its construction, only to be re-used for simple rock-cut tombs. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the unusual geographic position of the pyramid: Old Kingdom pyramids were commonly built on high grounds, while the pyramid Lepsius I lies on a flat plain. Thus, the datation of this monument to the late 3rd dynasty no longer seems tenable.|$|E
25|$|Sheldon Nahmod of Chicago-Kent College of Law shares Wells's criticism. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> {{one case}} in {{particular}} where the Court seemed {{to recognize the}} theory that constitutional violations should always be grounds for liability regardless of whatever other issues exist. In Carey v. Phipus, decided a year after Mt. Healthy, the Court held that two students challenging their suspensions were entitled to prove that their due process rights were violated as they alleged even if the suspensions themselves {{turned out to have}} been factually justified. While not a constitutional claim, he also looks to 1995's McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., a case under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, where an age discrimination verdict against a private employer was upheld even though the respondent had concededly met the Mt. Healthy burden with evidence of her wrongdoing because that evidence was discovered subsequent to the employee's termination.|$|E

25|$|Lomborg {{analyzes}} {{three major}} themes: life expectancy, food and hunger, and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved {{over the past}} centuries, even though several {{regions of the world}} remain threatened, in particular by AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake of calories is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in agriculture. However, Lomborg notes that Africa in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues that wealth, as measured by per capita GDP, should not be the only judging criterion. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E
500|$|However, Stephen Brockman {{cautions}} against making [...] "all-too-sweeping assumptions" [...] {{about how}} effective Jud Süß {{was as a}} propaganda tool. To support his argument, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> anecdotal evidence that, rather than being perceived as a despicable Jew, Marian's portrayal of Süß {{was considered to be}} quite sympathetic; so much so that he received fan mail from women who had become infatuated with his character.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the old man. She looked down. I {{think she}} trembled.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the row of}} {{rugs and}} carpets airing beside the carriage-shed.|$|R

500|$|Kroyanker {{contends that}} not only did the Clal Center fail to revitalize Jaffa Road, it [...] "actually {{accelerated}} its degeneration". In particular, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the lack of anchor stores, the lack of continuity of small businesses, and the cessation of activity in the stores and banks in the Clal Center in the early afternoon for making the project [...] "a typical Jerusalem commercial failure".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{agree that}} Skin & Bone {{is as much}} about Los Angeles and the film {{industry}} as it is about prostitution or even homosexuality. [...] Writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, critic Gary Morris suggests that the film is [...] "inevitably set in Los Angeles, amid that city's arid strip malls, newsstands, and endless dusty streets" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the significance of Ghislaine's constant movement through the city, [...] "looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses".|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{questioned}} why the woman's husband kills himself. Strong finds {{the arguments that}} the husband is driven to suicide by the wife's screaming to be problematic because the suicide occurs {{at the moment the}} screams are silenced. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Hemingway's statement in Death in the Afternoon, [...] "if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it", as evidence that the husband may have killed himself because he is [...] "driven frantic by his wife's pain, and perhaps his own".|$|E
