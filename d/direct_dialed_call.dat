50|$|From 1 June 2010, BT payphones have £0.60 {{minimum charge}} which is for first 30 minutes of any <b>direct</b> <b>dialled</b> {{national}} geographic <b>call.</b> Previously the minimum charge was £0.40 {{for the first}} 20 minutes of any <b>direct</b> <b>dialled</b> national geographic <b>call.</b> Then before November 2006 the minimum charge was £0.30, before 2004 it was £0.20 and before 2000 it was £0.10. However, making a call using a credit/debit card incurs a minimum charge of £1.20, and includes 1 minute of call time, £0.20 per minute thereafter, as of September 2011.|$|R
50|$|The initial 86 area codes were {{assigned}} in 1947 as routing codes for operator calls; the first cross-country Bell System <b>direct</b> distance <b>dial</b> <b>call</b> {{was made in}} 1951. The system was based on fixed-length numbers; a direct-dial long distance call consisted of a three-digit area code and a seven-digit local number. Numbers in 2L+4N cities (such as Montréal and Toronto) were systematically lengthened to seven digits in the 1950's, a few exchanges at a time, so that all local numbers were seven digits when <b>direct</b> distance <b>dialling</b> finally came to town.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{overseas}} departments (départements d'outre mer or DOMs), Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana and Réunion have separate country codes from metropolitan France, {{although they are}} treated {{as part of the}} French numbering plan, with <b>direct</b> <b>dialing</b> for <b>calls</b> between the DOMs (including collectivités territoriales) and metropolitan France. Guadeloupe shares its country code with the collectivities Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin). Calls between the DOMs and metropolitan France require only the '0' to be dialed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{address is}} a text string {{with the following}} format: [...] Area code, subaddress and name are optional; the latter can carry extension number for <b>direct</b> inward <b>dialing</b> and <b>calling</b> party name, as used by ISDN/E1/T1 telecommunication protocols.|$|R
50|$|On November 11, 1951, {{the first}} <b>direct</b> <b>dial</b> long-distance {{telephone}} <b>call</b> in North America was placed from Mayor M. Leslie Denning of Englewood, New Jersey to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California via AT&T's Bell System. The ten digit call (seven digits plus a three-digit area code) was connected automatically within 18 seconds.|$|R
50|$|For {{voice over}} IP resellers, some {{specialized}} CLECs (for local numbers) or interexchange carriers (for toll-free numbers) will deliver blocks of <b>direct</b> inward <b>dial</b> <b>calls</b> already converted to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or common VoIP formats. The individual VoIP provider need only obtain {{an inventory of}} local or freephone numbers from VoIP-aware carriers in various regions, import them in bulk to a VoIP PBX (such as Asterisk) and issue them individually to end users. International DID numbers can be purchased in bulk from international providers.|$|R
5000|$|One {{variation}} of identifying the <b>calling</b> party on <b>direct</b> <b>dialed</b> long distance <b>calls</b> {{is a party}} code, usually a single digit inside a circle displayed on the phone's number tag. The dialing sequence for such calls is [...] "1" [...] (access number for DDD), the party code, the area code, and the desired number (1 + party code + area code + number).|$|R
5000|$|Nextel Communications traces {{its roots}} to the 1987 {{foundation}} of FleetCall by Morgan O'Brien, Brian McAuley, Chris Rogers, and Peter Reinheimer. FleetCall {{changed its name}} to Nextel Communications, Inc. in 1993. Nextel provided digital, wireless communications services, originally focusing on fleet and dispatch customers, but later marketed to all potential wireless customers. Nextel's network operated in the 800 MHz Specialized Mobile Radio band and used iDEN technology developed by Motorola. Nextel's iDen network offered a then unique push-to-talk [...] "walkie-talkie" [...] feature in addition to <b>direct</b> <b>dialed</b> voice <b>calls.</b> Nextel {{was one of the first}} providers in the United States to offer a national digital cellular coverage footprint.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attendant}} console {{may also be}} sent other calls that the PBX may not otherwise know how to handle, such as <b>direct</b> inward <b>dialed</b> <b>calls</b> that are not associated with a valid extension. The {{attendant console}} typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so the attendant may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the public phone must dial the attendant, who can complete the call for them.|$|R
5000|$|The 905 {{area code}} was once {{used as a}} block of {{alternate}} numbers for calls from the United States to Mexico (+52-5-...) {{in the days when}} overseas calls otherwise would have needed to be placed through a telephone operator. This use became obsolete with the widespread introduction of <b>direct</b> <b>dial</b> overseas <b>calls</b> and was completely abolished no later than February 1, 1991. Partly because of this prior usage of the number 905, area code 905 was the last of the [...] "original-1947-format" [...] area codes (that is, area codes with [...] "0" [...] zero or [...] "1" [...] one for the middle digit, and 2-9 for the first digit) to be assigned.|$|R
5000|$|Each pair of plugs {{was part}} of a cord circuit with a switch {{associated}} that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance <b>dialing</b> and customer <b>Direct</b> <b>Dial</b> (DDD) <b>calling,</b> switchboard operators would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete long distance calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1973, {{cellular}} {{mobile phone technology}} was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles. [...] The first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1960, called MTA (mobile telephone system A). Calls from the car were <b>direct</b> <b>dial,</b> whereas incoming <b>calls</b> required an operator to determine which base station the phone was currently at. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. In 1971, the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success. [...] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.|$|R
50|$|The initial area codes {{were created}} in 1947 as routing codes for operator-assisted calls. Québec and Ontario were the only provinces that {{received}} multiple area codes. Quebec was split between area codes 514 and 418. 514 originally covered the entire western half of Quebec, from the Canada-US border to the Hudson Strait. This area nominally included several remote areas in the far northern portion of the province which, at the time, didn't have telephone service. The first Bell System <b>direct</b> distance <b>dial</b> <b>call</b> was made in 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California, using a system based on fixed-length area codes plus seven-digit local numbers. Montreal and Toronto, the largest Canadian cities, were six digits (2L+4N) at the time. Between 1951 and 1958, numbers were lengthened by adding a digit (2L+5N) in preparation for deployment of <b>direct</b> distance <b>dialling.</b> The 514 area code was split in 1957 to create area code 819 for most of western Quebec, from Estrie (Sherbrooke) to the Ontario border, with the then-unserved far northern portion nominally added to 418 (and later moved to 819). 514 was reduced to the region surrounding Montreal.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a phreak {{would gain}} access to {{international}} dialing at low or zero cost by some other means, make a <b>dialed</b> <b>call</b> to a country that was available via <b>direct</b> <b>dialing,</b> and then use the System 4 blue box to clear down the international connection and make a call to a destination that was available only via operator service.|$|R

50|$|The first fully {{automated}} mobile phone system for vehicles {{was launched in}} Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were <b>direct</b> <b>dial,</b> whereas incoming <b>calls</b> required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurén and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40 kg. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success. The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.|$|R
