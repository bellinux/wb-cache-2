40|$|Abstract <b>Draw</b> <b>beads</b> {{are used}} in sheet metal forming {{processes}} to regulate material flow and achieve higher quality in the parts. The <b>draw</b> <b>beads</b> impose <b>draw</b> restraining force on the blank which eliminates defects such as wrinkling, tearing and reduces springback. In a draw-bend test, the draw restraining force is imitated by the back force applied through a hydraulic ram. As the back force increases, large strain is induced which reduces springback tendency. This study evaluates the influence of back force on the springback behavior in advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Three grades of dual-phase steel, namely DP 600, DP 800, DP 980, are used with normalized back forces ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 1. The springback decreases as the back force increases. Anticlastic curvature as well as curl radius has significant influence on the springback behavior of dual phase steels. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> could reduce the concave/convex wall features. However, it also affected the wall thinning. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} determine the suitable <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> geometry to obtain a straight wall without the wall thinning. In this study, the effects of <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> geometry of height and width on concave/convex wall feature and wall thinning were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and experiments. Based on the stress distribution analysis, the increasing in <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> width and the decreasing in <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> height lead to the concave wall feature increased; however, the {{application of}} the too small <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> width and the too large <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> height generated the convex wall feature. The wall thinning also decreased as the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> width increased as well as the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> height decreased. Therefore, the application of suitable <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> height and width significantly suppressed the concave/convex wall feature and wall thinning, which resulted in the straight wall with the smallest wall thinning could be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sheet metal deep-draw die is {{primarily}} constructed with <b>draw</b> <b>bead,</b> {{which is then}} modified based on trial and error to obtain a successful forming without splitting. This work aims at a robust design of forming die using numerical analysis and the Taguchi method. A three dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of a sheet metal forming process of SPCEN steel has been successfully developed using the material flow stress obtained from the modified Erichsen cup test. The model was validated with the actual forming experiment and the results agreed well. The influence of <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> parameters on splitting and thinning distributions were examined using the Taguchi method. Four parameters, namely the friction coefficient, <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> height, radius and shoulder radius were investigated. The Taguchi main effect analysis and ANOVA {{results show that the}} height and shoulder radius of the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> are the most important factor influencing the thinning distribution. Applying the Taguchi method and using the minimum thinning percentage as the design criteria, the optimum die design was identified as height, radius, shoulder radius and the friction coefficient of 4, 8, 8 mm and 0. 125 respectively. The verified finite element model using the optimum die design was conducted. The predicted Taguchi response was within 5. 9 % from finite element analysis prediction. The improvement in the reduction of thinning percentage was 22. 35 %...|$|E

40|$|Boundary {{conditions}} have the principle {{influence on the}} process of sheet metal deep drawing. One of the main boundary conditions is draw beads restraining force. Draw beads are used to control the flow of sheet metal while forming large panels. They prevent wrinkling in formed panels and reduce the blankholder force. <b>Draw</b> <b>bead</b> restraining forces are usually evaluated by means of <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> modelling device. In this thesis a <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> modelling apparatus is used to assess the influence of variation in material, bead geometry, drawing velocity, friction conditions, sheet metal rolling direction, roughness of tool (influenced by wear) and blankholder force on the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> restraining force and drawing force. Results from tests can be used as inputs for sheet metal forming simulation programs. Today a lot of programs for the deep drawing simulation exist. There is very important to know in practice how much the simulation results correspond the reality. Therefore on the Skoda Felicia fender the main deformations lay out were measured by means of the mesh measuring method. The results were then compared with values of deformations which were determined by deep drawing simulation software ICEM STAMP. This software is based on the minimal deformation energy method. It could be the reason of the small correspondence between simulation and experiments. The agreement would be surely better if some software based on the finite elements method (FEM) was used.

In order to investigate the causes and control methods of the drive line, the box-shaped part with curved bottom was designed based on the shape characteristics of automobile panel.

50|$|There {{are several}} methods for making <b>drawn</b> <b>beads,</b> {{but they all}} involve pulling a strand out of a gather of glass {{in such a way}} as to {{incorporate}} a bubble in the center of the strand to serve as the hole in the bead. In Arekamedu this was accomplished by inserting a hollow metal tube into the ball of hot glass and pulling the glass strand out around it, to form a continuous glass tube. In the Venetian bead industry, molten glass was gathered on the end of a tool called a puntile ("puntying up"), a bubble was incorporated into the center of a gather of molten glass, and a second puntile was attached before stretching the gather with its internal bubble into a long cane. The pulling was a skilled process, and canes were reportedly drawn to lengths up to 200 ft long. The drawn tube was then chopped, producing individual <b>drawn</b> <b>beads</b> from its slices. The resulting beads were cooked or rolled in hot sand to round the edges without melting the holes closed; were sieved into sizes; and, usually, strung onto hanks for sale.|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{utilizing}} {{aluminum alloys}} in automobiles {{has increased in}} recent years {{as a result of the}} desire to lower automobile weight and, consequently, increase fuel economy. While aluminum alloy use in cast parts has increased, outer body panel applications are still being investigated. The industry is interested in improving the formability of these sheet alloys by a combination of alloy design and processing. A different avenue of improving the formability of these alloys may be through patterning of the sheet surface. Surface patterns hold the lubricant during the forming process, with a resulting decrease in the sheet-die surface contact. While it has been speculated that an optimum surface pattern would consist of discrete cavities, detailed investigation into the reduction of forming friction by utilizing discrete patterns is lacking. A series of discrete patterns were investigated to determine the dependence of the forming friction of automotive aluminum alloys on pattern lubricant carrying capacity and on material strength. Automotive aluminum alloys used in outer body panel applications were rolled on experimental rolls that had been prepared with a variety of discrete patterns. All patterns for each alloy were characterized before and after testing both optically and, to determine pattern lubricant capacity, using three dimensional laser profilometry. A <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> simulation (DBS) friction tester was designed and fabricated to determine the forming friction of the patterned sheets. Tensile testing and frictionless DBS testing were performed to ascertain the material properties of each sheet. The most striking result of this work was the inversely linear dependence of forming friction on the lubricant carrying capacity of the discrete patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of fuel consumption {{and carbon dioxide}} emissions are currently a key factor for the aviation industry due to major concerns about climate change and more restrictive environmental laws. One way to reduce both fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions is by significantly decreasing the vehicle’s weight while increasing engine's efficiency. In order to meet these requirements, the European aero engine industry is continuously focusing on alternative manufacturing methods for load carrying structures in advanced materials, such as titanium and nickel-based superalloys. Alternatively to traditional large-scale single castings, new manufacturing methods involve sheet metal parts, small castings and forgings assembled by welding. These new manufacturing methods allow more flexible designs in which each part is made of the most suitable material state, leading to several advantages such as {{reduction of}} product cost and weight while increasing engine's efficiency. Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in the aero engine industry, typically constituting up to 50 % of the total weight of the aircraft engine. Due to their excellent material properties at high temperatures in severe corrosive environments, these superalloys are employed most extensively in the hot sections of gas turbine engines for both military and civil aircrafts with running temperatures up to 650 °C. In this thesis, a manufacturing process chain including forming and welding in the nickelbased superalloy 718 is studied. The main focus in the work lies on determining the thermomechanical properties, modelling and simulation of cold forming, study forming limits based on Nakazima tests for forming limit curves (FLC) and applying a damage and failure criterion. The work also comprises a brief study on hot forming. Finally, modelling of a subsequent welding procedure is included where residual stresses from the forming simulation are used to predict shape distortions due to the welding procedure. The results are compared with experimental observations. The cold forming procedure of a double-curved component made of alloy 718 is studied using FE-analyses and forming tests. The same geometry was used to produce a hot forming tool. During forming tests at room temperature, micro cracks and open cracks were observed in the <b>draw</b> <b>bead</b> regions, not indicated when formability is assessed using a forming limit curve (FLC). Standard material models such as von Mises or Barlat Yld 2000 - 2 D were not capable of accurately predict the behaviour of the material after the point of diffuse necking, making the prediction of damage and failure during forming a challenge. The GISSMO damage model was therefore calibrated and used to predict material failure in forming of alloy 718. Tensile, plane strain, shear and biaxial tests at room temperature are performed up to fracture and continuously evaluated using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) by ARAMIS™. In this work, the GISSMO damage model is coupled with the anisotropic Barlat Yld 2000 - 2 D material model for forming simulations in alloy 718 at room temperature using LS-DYNA. Numerical predictions are able to accurately predict failure on the same regions as observed during the experimental forming tests. Comparisons {{of the distribution of}} damage on one of the draw beads between simulations and damage measurements by acoustic emission indicate that higher damage values correspond to bigger micro cracks. Numerical FE-predictions of the cold forming and subsequent welding procedure shows that the welding procedure further increases the shape distortions. This was found to agree with experimental observations. Virtuell processkedja för plåtformade flygmotorstrukturer i superlegeringar – Validering och demonstrato...|$|E
