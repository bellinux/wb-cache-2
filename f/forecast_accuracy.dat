40|$|M. Ing. Undoubtedly, <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{presents}} {{many advantages}} to a business, but {{the opposite is}} also true for forecasting inaccuracy. This paper is intended to outline the effects of <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> on business planning while also investigating factors that affect it. The role of the human element {{in this regard is}} also discussed in the report. The study is qualitative in nature with an exploratory approach. A survey and focus group interviews / discussions were conducted so as to achieve the aim of the project. The information obtained from these two methods was used to explore the research questions which in turn were designed to identify the impact of <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> and factors that affect this accuracy. The findings of the study indicate that the effect of <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> is more significant than commonly perceived. The findings also outline the important factors affecting <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The basis of this argument {{is that most of the}} factors that affect <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be controlled and are centered on people.

30|$|This {{decrease}} in <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> when {{the level of}} aggregation is reduced {{is the reason that}} data mining techniques are not applicable for the discussed problem. The advantage of data mining techniques is that its algorithms can capture more complex demand patterns compared to other forecasting methods. In this case however, more complex patterns can only be revealed when the level of aggregation is reduced. As this leads to lower <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> (due to superimposition by noise) data mining techniques cannot unveil their potential to increase <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> in this case.|$|R

This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called saving hypotheses, cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor. A study of the predictive validity of Occam’s razor found 32 published papers that included 97 comparisons of economic forecasts from simple and complex forecasting methods. None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved <b>forecast</b> <b>accuracy.</b> In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors {{by an average of}} 27 percent.|$|E

40|$|Hybridizing {{evolutionary}} algorithms with {{a support}} vector regression (SVR) model {{to conduct the}} electric load forecasting has demonstrated the superiorities in <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> improvements. The recently proposed bat algorithm (BA), compared with classical GA and PSO algorithm, has greater potential in <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy</b> improvements. However, the original BA still suffers from the embedded drawbacks, including trapping in local optima and premature convergence.

This paper presents a novel load forecasting approach, namely SVRCQBA model, by hybridizing the SVR model with the quantum computing mechanism, chaotic mapping function, and BA, to receive higher <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SVRCQBA model is superior to other alternative models in terms of <b>forecasting</b> <b>accuracy...</b>|$|R
