40|$|What are {{economic}} exchanges? The received {{view has}} it that exchanges are mutual transfers <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> motivated by inverse valuations thereof. As a corollary, the standard approach treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services as a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> We raise two objections against this standard approach. First, it is incomplete, as it fails to take into account, among other things, the offers and acceptances that lie {{at the core of}} even the simplest cases <b>of</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Second, it ultimately fails to generalize to <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services, in which neither inverse preferences nor mutual transfers hold true. We propose an alternative definition <b>of</b> <b>exchanges,</b> which treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> as a special case <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services and which builds in offers and acceptances. According to this theory: (i) The valuations motivating exchanges are propositional and convergent rather than objectual and inverse; (ii) All <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> involve <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services/actions, but not the reverse; (iii) Offers and acceptances, together with the contractual obligations and claims they bring about, {{lie at the heart of}} all cases <b>of</b> <b>exchange...</b>|$|R

25|$|Poverty {{and lack}} of {{educational}} and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work. As globalization opened up national borders to greater <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and capital, labor migration also increased. Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. Gender inequalities that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.|$|E

25|$|Trade is the {{voluntary}} <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, {{and is a}} form of economics. A mechanism that allows trade is called a market. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Because of specialization and division of labor, most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an absolute or comparative advantage in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of mass production.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no first pay stub for the first work-for-pay exchange, the first {{salaried}} work would have required a society advanced {{enough to have a}} barter system which allowed for the even <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> or services between tradesmen. More significantly, it presupposes the existence of organized employers—perhaps a government or a religious body—that would facilitate work-for-hire exchanges on a regular enough basis to constitute salaried work. From this, most infer that the first salary would have been paid in a village or city during the Neolithic Revolution, sometime between 10,000 BCE and 6000 BCE.|$|E

25|$|Several liberals, {{including}} Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, {{argued that}} the free <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> between nations would lead to world peace. Smith argued that as societies progressed, the spoils of war would rise but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations. Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened {{the welfare of the}} state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British imperialism, which he believed {{was the result of the}} economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden, and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{maritime}} trade between Europe and China began in 1557 when the Portuguese leased an outpost at Macau. Other European nations soon followed the Portuguese lead, inserting {{themselves into the}} existing Asian {{maritime trade}} network to compete with Arab, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese merchants in intra-regional trade. After the Spanish conquest of the Philippines the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> between China and Europe accelerated dramatically. From 1565 on, the Manila Galleons brought silver into the Asian trade network from mines in South America. China was the primary destination for the precious metals, as the imperial government mandated that Chinese goods could only be exported in exchange for silver bullion.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{findings of}} imported iron blades and local iron working appear in 500 BC. From about 50 AD, {{there are indications}} of a more intense long-distance <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in coastal Finland. Inhabitants exchanged their products, presumably mostly furs, for weapons and ornaments with the Balts and the Scandinavians {{as well as with}} the peoples along the traditional eastern trade routes. The existence of richly furnished burials, usually with weapons, suggests that there was a chiefly elite in the southern and western parts of the country. Hillforts spread over most of southern Finland at the end of the Iron and early Medieval Age. There is no commonly accepted evidence of early state formations in Finland, and the presumably Iron Age origins of urbanization are contested.|$|E

25|$|Cornwall's geography, a long, {{narrowing}} peninsula, pointing {{into the}} Atlantic, made travel by land (Cornwall is only joined to Devon {{by a short}} four-mile stretch of land—the River Tamar divides the rest) slow, unreliable and poor. (Crossing the Tamar was by a few ancient stone bridges and two ferries to Plymouth). Selling and distribution of market goods used the sea and major rivers. However, improved telecommunications stimulated growth in the ports of Cornwall and the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> particularly of mining products, like copper and tin. It also led to previously unexplored markets being discovered, for example arsenic, a by-product of tin production, was exported to the USA, where it {{was used in the}} production of pesticides in the cotton fields.|$|E
25|$|Geography {{contributed to}} {{important}} geopolitical differences. For {{most of their}} histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the Ottoman Empire controlled almost all the Middle East, the Ming dynasty ruled China, and the Mughal Empire held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided {{into a number of}} warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the Roman Empire, tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> people, ideas and inventions.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} area of Barranquilla {{did not include}} mineral or natural riches, and thus did not serve as a location where the Spanish maintained a permanent presence. Its importance was not appreciated until the mid-19th century, due {{to the introduction of}} steamships that navigated the Magdalena River by the German Juan Bernardo Elbers on behalf of Simón Bolívar at the founding of Gran Colombia in 1823. The route was opened on November 10, 1825. Barranquilla thus initiated a lively <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> with cities and towns of the Colombian interior, as well as with international merchants, and it became a principal port for the export of coffee. With the establishment of the new nation of the Republic of New Granada in 1831, two revolutions began in Barranquilla. One was led by Policarpo Martínez, Antonio Pantoja, Lorenzo Hernández, Crispín Luque, Esteban Márquez y Santos de la Hoz against the dictatorship of Rafael Urdaneta. The second was led by General Ignacio Luque, who had crushed the first revolution.|$|E
