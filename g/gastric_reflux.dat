25|$|Backing up {{of fluid}} through the {{intestinal}} tract is usually {{due to a}} downstream obstruction, ileus, or proximal enteritis, and its presence usually indicates a small intestinal disease. Generally, the closer the obstruction is to the stomach, the greater amount of <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux</b> will be present. Approximately 50% of horses with <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux</b> require surgery.|$|E
25|$|Proximal enteritis, {{also known}} as {{anterior}} enteritis or duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ), is inflammation of the duodenum and upper jejunum. It is potentially caused by infectious organisms, such as Salmonella and Clostridial species, but other possible contributing factors include Fusarium infection or high concentrate diets. The inflammation of the intestine leads to large secretions of electrolytes and fluid into its lumen, and thus large amounts of <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux,</b> leading to dehydration and occasionally shock.|$|E
25|$|Signs include acute {{onset of}} {{moderate}} to severe pain, large volumes orange-brown and fetid <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux,</b> distended small intestine on rectal examination, fever, depression, increased heart rate and respiratory rate, prolonged CRT, and darkened mucous membranes. Pain level usually improves after gastric decompression. It is important to differentiate DPI from small intestinal obstruction, since obstruction may require surgical intervention. This can be difficult, and often requires a combination of clinical signs, results from the physical examination, laboratory data, and ultrasound to help suggest one diagnosis over the other, but a definitive diagnosis can only be made with surgery or on necropsy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Because 24 -h esophageal pH {{monitoring}} {{is quite}} invasive, {{the diagnosis of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) -associated cough has usually been made based merely on the clinical efficacy of treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Case presentation We recently encountered two patients with PPI-responsive chronic non-productive cough for whom switching from bronchodilators and glucocorticosteroids to PPI resulted in improvement of cough. The cough returned nearly to pre-administration level {{a few weeks after}} discontinuation of PPI. Though GERD-associated cough was suspected, 24 -h esophageal pH monitoring revealed that the cough rarely involved <b>gastric</b> acid <b>reflux.</b> Following re-initiation of PPI, the cough disappeared again.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{characteristics}} of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes of gallbladder heat attacking the stomach and stagnant heat of the liver and stomach in patients with reflux esophagitis (RE), in terms of clinical symptoms, combination of gallbladder conditions, esophageal mucosal inflammation, <b>gastric</b> bile <b>reflux</b> under endoscopy and helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. Methods: Patients with RE were enrolled from Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine from June 2007 to December 2009 and patients exhibiting the syndrome of gallbladder heat attacking the stomach or stagnant heat of the liver and stomach were collected. The patients were requested to complete clinical questionnaires. The general data, characteristics of clinical symptoms, combination of gallbladder conditions, esophageal mucosal inflammation, <b>gastric</b> bile <b>reflux</b> under endoscopy and HP infection of the two patterns were compared. Results: The average age of the selected patients with gallbladder heat attacking the stomach was older than that of the patients with stagnant heat of the liver and stomach (P< 0. 01) and the accompanying clinical signs and symptoms were more severe (P< 0. 01). The incidence of gallbladder diseases in patients with gallbladder heat attacking the stomach was higher than that of the patients with stagnant heat of the liver and stomach (P< 0. 01). The extent of the esophageal mucosal inflammation under endoscopy as well as the <b>gastric</b> bile <b>reflux</b> and the incidence of HP infection was also more severe (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: There are significant differences in several regards between the syndromes of gallbladder heat attacking the stomach and stagnant heat of the liver and stomach in patients with RE. These characteristics may provide sound evidence for differentiation of signs and symptoms for this disease...|$|R
25|$|Nasogastric intubation, a {{mainstay}} of colic management, is often repeated multiple times until resolution of clinical signs, both {{as a method of}} <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux</b> removal and as a way to directly administer fluids and medication into the stomach. Reflux must be removed periodically to prevent distention and possible rupture of the stomach, and to track reflux production, which aids in monitoring the progression of the colic. Its use is especially important in the case of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, since both of these cause excessive secretion of fluid into the intestine, leading to fluid back-up and distention of the stomach. Nasogastric intubation also has the benefit of providing pain relief resulting from gastric distention.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the causes}} for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of {{miscellaneous}} factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux,</b> lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for laryngoscopy and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. Patients who suffer from the burning mouth syndrome, most likely menopausal women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.|$|E
25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by intravenous catheter, to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the intestinal lumen leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux</b> to the daily maintenance requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the IV fluid requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less IV fluid support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3–5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of IV fluid administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E

Replacement of the nomial squamous epithelium of the oesophagus with columnar epithelium (Barrett?s oesophagus) {{as a consequence of}} chronic <b>gastric</b> acid <b>reflux</b> is considered as a premalignant condition.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) remains a major clinical challenge to date. Repeated alveolar epithelial microinjuries are considered {{as the starting}} point and the key event in both the development and the progression of IPF. Various pro-fibrotic agents have been identified and shown to cause alveolar damage. In IPF, however, no leading cause of alveolar epithelial microinjuries can be identified and the exact etiology remains elusive. New results from epidemiologic studies suggest a causal relation between IPF and frequent episodes of <b>gastric</b> <b>refluxes</b> resulting in <b>gastric</b> microaspirations into the lung. The effect of gastric contents on the alveolar epithelium has not been investigated in detail. Here, we present a microfluidic lung epithelial wounding system that allows for the selective exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to gastric contents. The system is revealed to be robust and highly reproducible. The thereby created epithelial microwounds are of tiny dimensions and best possibly reproduce alveolar damage in the lung. We further demonstrate that exposure to gastric contents, namely hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsin, directly damages the alveolar epithelium. Together, this novel in vitro wounding system allows for the creation of in vivo-like alveolar microinjuries with the potential to study lung injury and alveolar wound repair in vitro...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of stricture formation arising from reflux esophagitis {{is considered to}} be as follows: <b>gastric</b> acid <b>reflux</b> causes inflammation in the lamina propria which is then disrupted, leading to stricture formation [6]. In addition, esophageal stricture caused by long-term nasogastric tube placement has also been reported, and according to the report, the use of a nasogastric tube for more than 2 – 4  weeks should be avoided [7]. The present patient had reflux esophagitis, had undergone long-term nasogastric tube placement, and did not receive PPIs, placing her at a high risk for stricture.|$|R

40|$|Injury of the {{oesophageal}} mucosa {{can result}} from exposure to <b>refluxed</b> <b>gastric</b> acid and pepsin. Competence of the lower oesophageal sphincter and peristaltic activity serve to reduce contract time between luminal acid and oesophageal mucosa, but intraluminal neutralisation of residual acid by bicarbonate may also be important in preventing oesophageal mucosal injury. Whereas swallowed saliva contains bicarbonate, recent experiments have also demonstrated alkali secretion from the mammalian oesophagus. Bicarbonate secretion from the human oesophagus was therefore examined with an intubation technique and perfusion of the oesophagus with a non-absorbable marker. Saliva, gastric, and oesophageal aspirates were collected and bicarbonate concentrations determined by measurements of pH and pCO 2 or by back titration. In 32 normal subjects (17 women, 15 men) median basal oesophageal bicarbonate secretion determined by a pH/pCO 2 method was 416 (range 139 - 1050) mumol/hour/ 10 cm. In a subgroup of 15 experiments median oesophageal bicarbonate output was 489 (range 157 - 1033) mumol/hour/ 10 cm (pH/pCO 2 method) compared with a median alkali output of 563 (range 135 - 799) mumol/hour/ 10 cm as determined by back titration. The difference was not significant. Salivary contamination of the oesophagus accounted for 25 % of all bicarbonate measured within the oesophagus and <b>refluxed</b> <b>gastric</b> bicarbonate accounted for 2. 5 %.

2500|$|The ileum is {{the last}} part of the small {{intestine}} that ends in the cecum. Ileal impaction can be caused by obstruction of ingesta. Coastal bermuda hay is associated with impactions in this most aborad (adj. [...] "In a direction away from the mouth".) segment of the small intestine, although it is difficult to separate this risk factor from geographic location, since the southeastern United States has a higher prevalence of ileal impaction and also has regional access to coastal Bermuda hay. Other causes can be obstruction by ascarids (Parascaris equorum), usually occurring at 3–5 months of age right after deworming, and tapeworms (Anoplocephala Perfoliata), which have been associated with up to 81% of ileal impactions (See Ascarids). Horses show intermittent colic, with moderate to severe signs and with time, distended small intestinal loops on rectal. Although most ileal impactions will sometimes pass without intervention, those present for 8–12 hours will cause fluid to back up, leading to <b>gastric</b> <b>reflux,</b> which is seen in approximately 50% of horses that require surgical intervention. Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs, presence of reflux, rectal exam, and ultrasound. Often the impaction can not be felt on rectal due to distended small intestinal loops that block the examiner. Those impactions that are unresponsive to medical management, which includes IV fluids and removal of reflux, may be treated using a single injection into the ileum with 1 liter of carboxymethylcellulose, and then massaging the ileum. This allows the impaction to be treated without actually cutting into the ileum. Prognosis for survival is good.|$|E
