5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first <b>forward</b> <b>guidance</b> as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate <b>forward</b> <b>guidance,</b> which it did on 7 August.|$|E

30|$|In [13], the DMND (Collecting Data from Mobile Using Named Data) {{model is}} {{proposed}} aiming at {{building a new}} architecture that can effectively handle vehicular mobility, intermittent connectivity, and data security. Different {{from the idea of}} our RSBLQ, the authors neglect the <b>forwarding</b> <b>guidance</b> of FIB in ICN and believe the most important advantage of NDN is its capability to fully utilize the broadcast nature of wireless channels. Therefore, they use a base station to broadcast routing announcements, Interest packets, and even PIT entries. Then, through the following naming scheme, DMND eliminates the limitations of TCP/IP and achieves high data collection efficiency. In addition, the network can use the application names directly for data communication, eliminating the need for any mapping system between application names and flat identifiers. Furthermore, with each piece of data standing on its own, one can secure the data directly instead of securing its containers. Thus, requested content {{does not have to be}} delivered directly from its originator to the data requester, as long as the latter has effective means to verify the integrity and origin of incoming data. At the same time, caching Interest packets and being able to broadcast from multiple base stations solve the problem of high-speed mobility. Therefore, the design of DMND improves network performance from different angles; it certainly achieves some advantage and gives us good inspiration for the content naming mechanism. However, we do not want to apply a broadcast way for packets in VANET.|$|R
