25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

[...] Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, [...] "the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory.

[...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis.

500|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, which stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. An action group was established. Hallgeir Matre stated that Stord had a lack of beaches and that the two islands [...] "were the last low, forested islands in the area after the paradise Eldøyane had been converted to an industrial area for Aker Stord during the 1970s". He further stated that environmentalists were skeptical to floating bridges, but that in this case it would be the lesser of two evils. The Stord Society for the Conservation of Nature applied for municipal grants to make a critical report, but this was rejected by the majority of the municipal council. By June, a new chapter had been established on Bømlo, and the group stated that it was irresponsible to build a link which would result in a massive increase in car use. Future <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Hands</b> started a petition which collected 1,600 signatures. A poll from 1990 showed that in Stord, 35 percent were in favor of the project, while 36.7 percent were opposed, given that the ferry service was improved, among other things with night ferries and increased comfort.|$|E

[...] Accordingly, sinners, themselves, cause their own loss. It is thus proper for people to mourn for their sins and for the evil consequences that they have brought upon their own souls. Jeremiah continues that since free choice is <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> and our own decision prompts us to commit wrongs, it is proper for us to repent and abandon our wickedness, for the choice is <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> This is implied by [...] "Let us search and examine our ways and return [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Second Intifada {{started in}} September 2000, when Ariel Sharon made {{a visit to}} the Temple Mount, also known as Al-Haram Al-Sharif, an area sacred to both Jews and Muslims. This visit was seen by Palestinians as highly provocative; and Palestinian demonstrators, {{throwing}} stones at police, were dispersed by the Israeli army, using tear gas and rubber bullets. On 28 September, Sharon, a Likud party candidate for Israeli Prime Minister, entered the Temple Mount, accompanied by over 1,000 security guards. He stated on that day, [...] "the Temple Mount is <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> and will remain <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> It is the holiest site in Judaism and it is the right of every Jew to visit the Temple Mount." [...] A riot broke out among Palestinians at the site, resulting in clashes between Israeli forces and the protesting crowd.
