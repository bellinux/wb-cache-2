Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> comet.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet.
