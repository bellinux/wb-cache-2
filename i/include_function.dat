50|$|This year's Cosplay Mania has {{increased}} their floor space to <b>include</b> <b>Function</b> Rooms 2 to 5, and Meeting Rooms 2 to 9, occupying over 7,000 sq/m. The layout {{has also been}} reversed, with the Exhibitor Hall occupying Function Rooms 4 and 5, and the stage area occupying 2 and 3. As a result, the Exhibitor Room, dubbed as Hall Ex, has over 200 exhibitor booths ranging from game booths to assorted merchandise. The stage are, dubbed Hall S, was smaller in size than last year, but has enough space in allowing audiences to comfortably enjoy the cosplay competition and the JAM concert. The meeting rooms are still assigned for Meet and Greet activities and merchandise selling.|$|E

50|$|In October 2015, {{plans were}} revised, as {{to allow for}} a {{skyscraper}} of 313 m in height, a six-star hotel with 388 rooms, and 680 residential apartments, across 90 levels; Nevertheless, by May 2016, plans submitted to the State Government revealed a further increase in height to 323.6 m - approximately two metres below the height limit imposed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The number of residential apartments was boosted to 708, whilst the number of 6-star hotel rooms remained at 388, and the footbridge across Queensbridge Street joining the development to Crown casino was preserved in the plans. Additionally, access to the 90th-level will be open to the public, which will <b>include</b> <b>function</b> space, bars, and gardens. London-based architectural firm WilkinsonEyre joined the project, after their design of One Queensbridge was chosen at an international design competition for the development in 2015. WilkinsonEyre previously collaborated with Crown Limited, having designed the Crown Sydney skyscraper currently under construction in Barangaroo, Sydney.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{protocols}} {{have been}} designed to implement memory coherency on clusters. The majority of these approaches support multiple readers and multiple writers accessing shared memory. By weakening this constraint we have designed and implemented a high performance, relatively transparent toolkit for multiple reader, single writer shared objects. The toolkit achieves a high degree of performance by using our implementation of Active Messages 2 to update copies of shared objects. Other key aspects of our design <b>include</b> <b>function</b> shipping and a lazy evaluation of updates. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{an extension}} of the concept of sketch, called a form, which allows the specification of entities other than limits and colimits in a model. A form can require that a diagram become (in a model) an instance of any categorial construction specifiable in an essentially algebraic way. Constructions which can be specified in this way <b>include</b> <b>function</b> space objects in and reflexive objects in a cartesian closed category, power objects in a topos, and list objects in a locos. This generalization is motivated by the desire to specify functional programming languages by sketches...|$|E
40|$|The main {{result of}} {{the paper is the}} use of {{orthogonal}} Hermite polynomials as the basis functions of feedforward neural networks. The proposed neural networks have some interesting properties: (i) the basis functions are invariant under the Fourier transform, subject only to a change of scale, (ii) the basis functions are the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator, and stem from the solution of Schrödinger's diffusion equation. The proposed feed-forward neural networks demonstrate the particle-wave nature of information and can be used in nonparametric estimation. Possible applications of the proposed neural networks <b>include</b> <b>function</b> approximation, image processing and system modelling. © Springer 2006...|$|E
