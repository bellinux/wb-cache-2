The resultant object, orbiting the former companion, now host star, could be a helium planet or diamond planet.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> haploid male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that they}} pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Route 33 {{begins in}} Trenton on a two-lane road. It passes through central Mercer County, joining {{northbound}} U.S. Route 130 in Robbinsville Township. It leaves the U.S. highway in East Windsor {{and becomes a}} local town road into the borough of Hightstown. It turns east again as it passes {{the east end of}} the Hightstown Bypass, where <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> divided arterial with four lanes as it makes its way through Monmouth County toward the shore. Around Freehold, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> freeway. It then crosses the Garden State Parkway's Exit 100 in Tinton Falls and Route 18 in Neptune. Here, it is locally known as Corlies Avenue. Route 33 ends at Route 71 in Neptune. It has two concurrencies along the route, one with Route 34 and the second with US 130.|$|E

5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of the {{activity}} of a hurricane season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Even before <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun {{will have}} nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over {{about half a}} billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

5|$|Several other SeeD members assist Squall's party. Dr. Kadowaki is the Balamb Garden {{doctor who}} tends to Squall's wounds after his fight with Seifer {{in the opening}} sequence. She also helps Headmaster Cid after his {{confrontation}} with NORG. Nida (another Star Wars reference, along with Biggs and Wedge) is a student at Balamb Garden who passes the SeeD exam along with Squall. He pilots Balamb Garden after <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> mobile base. Lastly, Xu is a high-ranking SeeD who helps Squall during the Dollet mission and the Garden civil war between NORG and Cid. She is friends with Quistis {{and a member of}} Squall's staff once he becomes the leader of Balamb Garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} medieval but became {{redundant}} during the 16th century. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> hall where Dutch merchants sold cloth.

5|$|At the {{intersection}} with County Line Road, PA 263 crosses the Bucks County line and enters Warminster Township as York Road. In this area, the route is a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes several businesses {{as it comes}} to the PA 132 (Street Road) intersection, where <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> four-lane divided highway that heads to the west of Archbishop Wood Catholic High School. The divided highway section ends at Roberts Road. PA 263 gains a center left-turn lane again as it continues north through more residential areas with a few businesses. Just before Bristol Road, Old York Road splits off from the route and PA 263 curves more to the northeast, retaining the name York Road.|$|E
5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the town line, NY275 enters the hamlet of Nile, where <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> two-lane {{residential}} street named Pennsylvania Avenue. In {{the center of the}} community, the route meets the east end of CR1 (Fifth Avenue). From here, NY275 bends back to the north, crossing through rural sections of the town of Friendship mostly populated by farms. The rural surroundings end ahead of the hamlet of Friendship, where NY275 heads through the residential western portion of the community. Near the center of Friendship, the highway intersects CR20 (West Main Street), the primary east–west street through the hamlet. NY275 continues on, crossing over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line (formerly the Erie Railroad's Main Line) to reach exit29 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY17). NY275 ends at the exit ramp leading away from the westbound direction of the freeway; however, NY275's right-of-way continues north to NY19 in Belfast as CR17.|$|E

5|$|NY12E {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of West Main and Bradley (NY12) streets in the city of Watertown. It initially proceeds northwest on West Main Street as a four-lane residential and commercial street; however, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> two-lane divided highway at a CSX Transportation railroad overpass just six blocks from NY12. Past the crossing, the road follows the Black River across the city line and into the town of Pamelia, where it becomes co-designated as CR190. The highway soon passes under Interstate81 and narrows to a two-lane undivided road before turning westward into the riverside village of Glen Park. It retains its Main Street name through the community, following a two-lane residential street through the village center and eventually into the adjacent village of Brownville.|$|E
5|$|No longer {{known by}} the BGCR name, the route meanders north, slowly edging east towards Reesor Road and now {{surrounded}} by undeveloped greenspace. It encounters Highway7, north of which <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> divided roadway travelling on {{the eastern edge of}} Cornell as well as parallel to and alongside Reesor Road. Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue, the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest, continuing to serve as the boundary of urban development in Markham. It narrows to a two lane road, with adjacent land along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes, before encountering Ninth Line again. Quickly curving north then east, sandwiched between the neighbourhood of Greenborough and Little Rouge Creek, the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
