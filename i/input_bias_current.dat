When the circuit functions as a universal biquad filter, the quality factor and pole frequency can be tuned orthogonally via the <b>input</b> <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> When it functions as a quadrature oscillator, the oscillation condition and oscillation frequency can be adjusted indepen-dently by the <b>input</b> <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> The proposed circuit can work as either a quadrature oscillator or a biquad filter without changing the circuit topology. The amplitude of the proposed oscillator can be independently controlled via the <b>input</b> <b>bias</b> <b>currents.</b> The proposed oscillator {{can be applied to}} provide amplitude modulated/amplitude shift keyed signals with the above-mentioned major advantages. The circuit is very simple, consisting of four dual-output second generation current controlled current conveyors (DO-CCCIIs), one operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), and two grounded capacitors.
