Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>return,</b> with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days."

Franco was offered Valenzuela's command, and promotion {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel. His ambition was too great to resist the opportunity, and he left for Morocco on 18 July 1923, making this promise to his fiancée: [...] "This year we will be married, above all else. If I do not die in combat, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>return</b> to you." [...] Having become Spain's most decorated soldier, Franco was eventually given a leave of forty days, and royal permission to marry. The wedding took place on 16 October/22 October 1923, in the church of San Juan el Real of Oviedo. Franco's best man was King Alfonso XIII, represented by General Antonio Losada, military governor of Asturias. Serving as maid of honour was Isabel Polo, Carmen's aunt. The witnesses were the Marquis de la Vega de Anzo, and Franco's brothers, Nicolás and Ramón. Franco did not invite his father, Nicolás Franco, whom he had never forgiven for leaving his mother and living in Madrid with another woman.|$|E
