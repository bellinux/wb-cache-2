5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

25|$|According to Pina, the Portuguese {{spent about}} a week raising a {{fortified}} siege camp on a hill west of Tangier. In a decision that was later to prove fateful, Henry ordered that the palisade protecting the Portuguese siege camp encircle the camp completely. This went against King Edward's advice to ensure the palisade extended <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> to offer the Portuguese besiegers protected access to the anchored ships. But given the unpopularity of the expedition, Henry probably calculated {{it was necessary to}} deprive the reluctant Portuguese levies of the temptation for an easy retreat back to the ships.|$|E

The line opened from Anzac Parade to Maroubra Beach in 1921, and closed in 1961. The line followed the current route of Sydney Buses' route 397.|$|E
25|$|At this time, {{the exiled}} Athenian leader Alcibiades {{was living in}} a castle near the Athenian camp. Coming <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> where the ships were gathered, he made several {{suggestions}} to the generals. First, he proposed relocating the fleet to the more secure base at Sestos. Second, he claimed that several Thracian kings had offered to provide him with an army. If the generals would offer him a share of the command, he claimed, he would use this army to assist the Athenians. The generals, however, declined this offer and rejected his advice, and Alcibiades returned home.|$|E
25|$|The Sant'Anna Church, {{built by}} the Armação fishing company, {{is part of the}} beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and {{attended}} the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds {{one of the most important}} archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction.|$|E

That July, they were married in Augsburg in southern Germany, where Marie's parents were residing. Rather than joining the artists' colony in Skagen directly, the Krøyers chose to spend their honeymoon alone in the little fishing village of Stenbjerg in Thy in the northwest of Jutland. They stayed at the local inn for two months, taking their easels <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> each day to paint.

Price, noticed the stranded vessel in the surf and gathered {{a group of people}} to assist in the rescue efforts. After learning of the disaster, Superintendent Hiram B. Shaw of the United States Life-Saving Service's Seventh Life-Saving District, hastened to the scene to assess the situation. Shaw quickly telegraphed for permission to have a life saving beach apparatus sent to him by train from Jupiter, Florida where the Jupiter Inlet Life Saving Station was located, approximately 180 miles south of Ormond Beach. This was quickly granted by General Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball. Because of the proximity and travel time from the Jupiter Inlet Station to Ormond Beach, Shaw had his small surf boat wheeled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> on a man-drawn wagon. He then went into town to procure necessary equipment and rope lines for the rescue.|$|E

500|$|Landing on {{the eastern}} flank No. 3 Commando would assault the Goebbels {{artillery}} battery, while No. 4 Commando {{would be responsible for}} the Hess battery on the western flank. The Hess battery consisted of six [...] guns in a concrete emplacement [...] inland from the coastal cliffs. The emplacement was surrounded by two rows of barbed wire, and protected by several machine gun posts. A nearby anti-aircraft tower could also defend against a ground attack on the guns. The commandos were responsible for their own planning and selected two landing beaches codenamed Orange one and two. Orange One at Varengeville was overlooked by a chalk cliff but had two gullies leading {{to the top of the}} cliff. Before the war there were steps <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> But these had been removed and the gullies filled with barbed wire and other obstacles. The second beach Orange Two was at Quiberville [...] further west at the mouth of the River Saane. This offered access to the top of the cliffs but was covered by two machine gun pillboxes and barbed wire and it was further away from their target. Intelligence had estimated that the strength of the battery was between 120–175 men, supported by two infantry companies stationed nearby.|$|E

Elliott was strongly opposed to this, as the men would have to row a long way, and the battalion would become disorganised from the start, but had to give way. Elliott went in the fifth boat. When his boat and the one following were about [...] from shore, they were met by a steam pinnace, which towed them to Anzac Cove, where Elliott stepped ashore at about 05:30. The plan called for the 2nd Brigade to advance on the left towards Hill 971, but Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan told him that the plan needed to be changed, and that the 2nd Brigade was required on the right, around the 400 Plateau. Climbing up to the 400 Plateau to view the situation for himself, Elliott was wounded in the ankle.
