2500|$|Rhapsody {{ranked the}} album #9 on its Rockâ€™s Best Albums of the Decade list. Rhapsody's Justin Farrar wrote [...] "Maybe there's {{something}} anachronistic about {{a band that}} plays funk music {{in the 21st century}} as if Parliament (let alone hip-hop) had never happened. It does sound like Sharon Jones could have cut her record in 1967, not 2007. But when the music's this good, those concerns fly out the window. Jones pours everything she's <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> album, and her gruff, passionate, brassy style grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go until the end. The Dap-Kings restrain themselves behind her, shuffling and jangling but leaving her plenty of space to maneuver on a clutch of good, if not great, songs." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was foolish}} not {{to wait until}} Sam {{came down to the}} water course. I started to get out alone and <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> pickle. Why didn't you shout when you came up?" ...|$|E
