5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was {{transformed}} from a localist union federation into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies.

5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E

Government intervention, <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> later colonial governments and continued since 1997, has steadily increased, with the introduction of export credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E
5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes <b>initiated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> previous government for housing and agricultural improvements.

On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E
