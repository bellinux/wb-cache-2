40|$|In my Diploma thesis I {{focus on}} {{rights and duties}} of the member of the Community of owners of housing units. The Community of owners of housing units and related issues are {{regulated}} in Act No. 72 / 1994 Coll., the <b>Flats</b> <b>Ownership</b> Act. Some general regulation can be found also in the Civil Code. First of all, in the introduction of my Diploma thesis I wanted to describe the reasons that lead me to choose this theme. After that I explained the methods I used {{in the process of}} completing of this thesis. After the explanation of the choice of the theme and the methods I concerned with the general regulation of the Community. In this chapter I described the birth of the Community and its articles of association. Here I was concerned with the approval and content of the articles of association and also with so called model articles of association and situations, when they are applicable. I also mentioned the regulation of bodies of the Community. According to <b>Flats</b> <b>Ownership</b> Act, the compulsory bodies of the Community are the meeting of unit owners and the statutory body, which can be represented either by committee or by the authorized owner. There is also a possibility to create special bodies of the Community by specific adjustment of the articles of association. At the end of this chapter I analyzed the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|I {{dedicated}} {{my thesis}} to the matters of <b>flat</b> <b>ownership</b> in Czech Republic. I chose the topic {{not only because}} it is my area of interest, but also because it is an acute problem, which impacts more than 1. 5 million of Czech citizens. During the 17 -year existence of the legislation and despite 13 amendments of the legislation, its application is often unclear. In my opinion, the legislation lacks sufficient regulations of the following: the establishment of a unit owners association, ensuring a proper management of unit owners association executive organs. In addition, some institutes have not been legislated but only regulated by secondary legislation - a Model Article - that however {{does not have to be}} adhered to by a unit owners association. In many cases, vague regulations or issues that have not been legislated, had to be resolved by judgment. First chapter provides an overview of the subject and the scope of the <b>Flat</b> <b>Ownership</b> Act (Act) and its concept and correlation with other acts, particularly the Civil Code. The second chapter discusses various types of establishment of <b>flat</b> <b>ownership.</b> The third chapter discusses various types of abolishment of <b>flat</b> <b>ownership,</b> including expropriation.

The topicality dwells not only in {{the fact that it is}} rather a new juridical institute but also in the fact that because of the increasing feature of common life in houses with flats owned by different people and because of the necessity to make decisions about the collective parts of the house and decisions about house operating, there are problems and disputes to be disclosed and there is a plethora of fundamentally different opinions on this topic. The legal regulations of these problems contained in the <b>flat</b> <b>ownership</b> law are rather complicated and from experience stemming from the law application one can see a whole row of insufficiencies that were taken care of by the above mentioned law updating and that did bring some improvement however attempts for preparation of the new <b>flat</b> <b>ownership</b> law seem to be uncertain.

40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of owner {{occupied}} housing in the Czech Republic. Attention is paid to the general importance of the provision of housing with emphasis on the social, economic and especially the legal aspects with respect to the rights that are granted by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It describes in brief the development of <b>flat</b> <b>ownership</b> since the 60 's {{and the role of the}} state in the housing policy, particularly with the aim to bring attention to the existing legal regulation of this area [...] the <b>Flat</b> <b>Ownership</b> Act.

Emphasis is put on the legal status of flat owners, the summary of rights and obligations that arise from ownership of a flat as a specific subject of property ownership. The ways in which <b>flat</b> <b>ownership</b> rights are formed are presented with regard to the consequences of the ownership rights being entered in the Land Registry.
