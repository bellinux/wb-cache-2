Despite suffering the least in terms of the stock exchange and financial markets among East Asian countries, the Philippines lagged in tax receipts in comparison to other nations. Meanwhile, private sector flows in the <b>external</b> <b>account</b> declined and led to a net outflow of $708 million in 2009, a sharp turning away from a net inflow of $507 million in 2008.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{theoretical}} and empirical insights into the effective use of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> by social activists in conflict arenas in order to bring about change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a longitudinal case study of Action on Smoking and Health UK (ASH) and their use of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> and other activist practices during the period 1999 - 2010. The authors explore these practices from the perspective of one organisation engaged in conflict arenas concerning the (un) acceptability of tobacco production, consumption and governance. The authors conduct the exploration based upon a dynamic conflict arena framework that attends to the range of <b>external</b> <b>accounting</b> and activist practices, tactical intentions and states of conflict used by ASH to confront the tobacco industry and bring about change in tobacco governance. Findings - The study identifies the use of a diverse range of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> and other activist practices. This assemblage of practices was used to confront, counter-act and to co-operate with actors engaged in tobacco-related conflicts. The evidence suggests that the deployment of different types of <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> by ASH was aligned to the context of the particular conflict arena involved, and was influenced by the strategy and engagement tactics of the activists and other actors, as well as power dynamics and acceptability of the tobacco governance in the conflict arena. Whilst ASH used different <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> in specific episodes of activism, these individual accounts also contributed to an emerging holistic account of the unacceptable consequences of tobacco production, consumption and governance. Originality/value - This study provides new theoretical and empirical insights into how <b>external</b> <b>accounts</b> can contribute to the problematisation of governance and development of social and environmental change agendas. The dynamic conflict arena framework developed in this paper creates new visibilities and possibilities for developing <b>external</b> <b>accounting</b> practices and for researching this fast-developing area of social and environmental accounting.

There are seven chapters.

The final three chapters: review previous analytical models; develop a simultaneous equation policy simulation model; and use the model to analyse the inter-relationships between Government expenditure, its consequent financing and impact upon both the private and the Government sectors' net current account position. The thesis highlights the impact of the Government's invisibles deficit, resulting from increased external borrowing, on the <b>external</b> current <b>account.</b> The major conclusion is that fiscal policy should not be used to insulate the economy from fluctuations in the <b>external</b> <b>accounts,</b> especially when financed by external borrowing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} fiscal deficits on the current account deficits in the Indian economy. In many developing countries, fiscal deficits are mostly financed through monetization, causing crowding out of private investment expenditures. However, fiscal deficits in India are mostly financed through official borrowings from various external sources, leading to higher interest payments and outgoings on the <b>external</b> <b>account.</b> Such a policy could eventually precipitate balance of payments crises despite favorable trade account and real exchange rate. Data over three decades for the Indian economy show that, {{in addition to the}} real exchange rate and the ratio of private investment to GDP, fiscal deficits significantly contribute to the current account deficits.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Economic Reform is {{described}} as a planned shift from one, Pareto inefficient, but quasi-stable, equilibrium (or 'trap') to a new Pareto superior equilibrium which is, or is designed to become, stable too. The concept is applied to recent 'shock' stabilization programs, with special reference to Israel, where the economy was credibly shifted from a 3 -digit inflationary process with considerable inertia, to relative price stability with higher real growth, at only small adjustment costs, by means of a 'heterodox' plan. This two-pronged stabilization program consisted of a substantial correction of budget and <b>external</b> <b>account</b> 'fundamentals' together with a synchronized, wage-price-exchange rate freeze. The idea is theoretically rationalized within a simple dual equilibrium inflation model, for which some econometric estimates are also given. ...|$|E
