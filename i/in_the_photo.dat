5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as {{the hub of the}} Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E

At the hospital, Keith hesitates when O’Dell asks him {{what he would do}} if Veronica were in danger. Veronica gets her necklace back from the perpetrator’s daughter. Because he gave bone marrow, the ex-husband now has a much more favorable divorce settlement. Veronica tracks down the suspect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo,</b> Wang Yi, but his roommate tells Veronica that he is Claire’s boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Mulder has Melissa undergo {{regression}} hypnosis for her {{to recount}} her past lives. She implies that she and Mulder have met over their past lives, always to be separated or lost to each other. To confirm her events, Mulder has himself hypnotized and recalls {{a time when he}} was a Jewish woman with a son, who had the same soul as his sister Samantha; his deceased father, who was Scully, is dead. Melissa was his husband in this life, and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man. Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War, when he was a man named Sullivan Biddle, while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh; Scully, Mulder claims, was his sergeant. Scully finds pictures of Biddle and Kavanaugh in the county's hall of records and gives them to Mulder. He wears Confederate uniform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo.</b>|$|E

5000|$|However, the CBS {{document}} {{does not}} illustrate the early {{versions of the}} flag and its description of the 1949 flag is not entirely consistent with <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> surviving from 1949.

5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for the man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photo,</b> and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near {{the end of the}} video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E
