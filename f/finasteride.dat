5|$|In late 2005, two NHL {{players who}} had been listed as {{potential}} Olympians failed drug tests administered by the WADA. American Bryan Berard, who had competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics, tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone. Canadian José Théodore failed a drug test because he was taking Propecia, a hair loss medication that contains the non-performance-enhancing drug <b>Finasteride.</b> Both players received two-year bans from international competition, although neither had made their team's final roster.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. <b>Finasteride</b> is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. <b>Finasteride</b> is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Finasteride</b> is a {{medication}} of the 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-ARI, <b>finasteride</b> prevents {{the conversion of}} testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in various tissues including the scalp. Increased hair on the scalp can be seen within three months of starting <b>finasteride</b> treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on the scalp at 24 and 48 months with continued use. Treatment with <b>finasteride</b> more effectively treats male-pattern hair loss at the vertex than male-pattern hair loss {{at the front of}} the head and temples.|$|E
25|$|Management {{may include}} simply {{accepting}} the condition. Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, <b>finasteride,</b> or hair transplant surgery. Evidence for <b>finasteride</b> in women, however, is poor {{and it may}} result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the association, <b>finasteride</b> {{improves}} glucose metabolism and decreases glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c, a surrogate marker for diabetes mellitus. The low SHBG seen with premature androgenic alopecia is also associated with insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|Hair loss can be slowed or {{reversed}} in {{its early}} stages with medication. Medications approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat male-pattern hair loss include minoxidil and <b>finasteride.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and <b>finasteride,</b> {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December 2007, Romário {{announced}} he had {{tested positive for}} <b>finasteride</b> (aka Propecia) after a match against Palmeiras on 28 October. He claims it was in an anti-baldness treatment; however, the drug is banned {{as it is a}} masking agent for anabolic steroids.|$|E
25|$|Treatment options {{including}} lifestyle changes, medications, {{a number}} of procedures, and surgery. In those with mild symptoms weight loss, exercise, and decreasing caffeine intake is recommended. In those with more significant symptoms medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as <b>finasteride.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} are being {{regularly}} screened, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (<b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride) reduce the overall risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer; however, there is insufficient data {{to determine if they}} {{have an effect on the}} risk of death and may increase the chance of more serious cases.|$|E
25|$|Dutasteride is a {{medication}} {{in the same}} class as <b>finasteride</b> but inhibits both type I and type II 5-alpha reductase. Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss in Korea and Japan, but not in the United States. However, it is commonly used off-label to treat male-pattern hair loss.|$|E
25|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to achieve this tissue selectivity of AR ligands. The most definitive evidence exists {{for the role of}} 5-alpha reductase. 5-alpha reductase is only expressed in specific tissues and could therefore be a unique contributor to tissue selectivity. Specific inhibition of the type 2 enzyme by <b>finasteride</b> blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT in the prostate.|$|E
25|$|There is also mixed/conflicting {{evidence}} that spironolactone may inhibit 5α-reductase, {{and thus the}} synthesis of the potent androgen DHT from testosterone, to some extent. However, the combination of spironolactone and the potent 5α-reductase inhibitor <b>finasteride</b> {{has been found to}} have significant improved effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism relative to spironolactone therapy alone, suggesting that any inhibition of 5α-reductase by spironolactone is only weak or at best incomplete.|$|E
25|$|This {{decrease}} in androgens and androgen receptors, {{and the increase}} in SHBG are opposite the increase in androgenic alopecia with aging. This is not intuitive, as testosterone and its peripheral metabolite, DHT, accelerate hair loss, and SHBG is thought to be protective. The ratio of T/SHBG, DHT/SHBG decreases by as much as 80% by age 80, in numeric parallel to hair loss, and approximates the pharmacology of antiandrogens such as <b>finasteride.</b>|$|E
25|$|MK-386 is a {{selective}} 5α-reductase type I inhibitor which was never marketed. Whereas 5α-reductase type II inhibitors achieve much higher reductions in circulating DHT production, MK-386 decreases circulating DHT levels by 20 to 30%. Conversely, {{it was found}} to decrease sebum DHT levels by 55% in men versus a modest reduction of only 15% for <b>finasteride.</b> Unfortunately, MK-386 failed to show significant effectiveness in a subsequent clinical study {{for the treatment of}} acne.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidelines}} {{were based on}} studies of SERMs from the MORE, BCPT P-1, and Italian trials. In the MORE trial, the relative risk reduction for raloxifene was 76%. The P-1 preventative study demonstrated that tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals. The relative risk reduction was up to 50% of new breast cancers, though the cancers prevented were more likely estrogen-receptor positive (this {{is analogous to the}} effect of <b>finasteride</b> on the prevention of prostate cancer, in which only low-grade prostate cancers were prevented). The Italian trial showed benefit from tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|Certain antiandrogens do {{not reduce}} {{testosterone}} or prevent its action upon tissues, but instead prevent its metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from forming. These medications {{can be used}} when the patient has male-pattern hair loss and/or an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), both of which DHT exacerbates. Two medications are currently available to prevent the creation of DHT: <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride. DHT levels can be lowered up to 60–75% with the former, and up to 93–94% with the latter. These medications have also {{been found to be}} effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} notable drug {{interactions}} with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline {{may increase the}} GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride, as well as inhibitors of 3α-HSD such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, inhibit the conversion of progesterone into its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites, and for this reason, may {{have the potential to}} block or reduce its sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include flutamide, and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in hirsutism. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride) may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
25|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors <b>finasteride</b> and {{dutasteride}} {{may also}} be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in patients were more severe symptoms and larger prostates. Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker. Side effects include decreased libido and ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction. The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their teratogenicity due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.|$|E
500|$|Fibres {{extracted}} from the leaf sheath of R.regia {{have been found to}} be comparable with sisal and banana fibres, but lower in density, making it a potentially useful source for the use in lightweight composite materials. [...] An extract from R.regia fruit known as D-004 reduces benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in rodents. [...] D-004, is a mixture of fatty acids, is being studied as a potential alternative to <b>finasteride</b> for the treatment of BPH.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the metabolism of NET, and 5α-reductase inhibitors such as <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride can inhibit its metabolism. The ethynyl group on the carbon 17 of NET is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites, this is due to the steric hindrance at that carbon.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors like <b>finasteride</b> and {{dutasteride}} {{can be used}} to slow {{or prevent}} androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss) and various other adverse androgenic symptoms (e.g., acne) in transgender men taking testosterone. However, they may also slow or reduce certain aspects of masculinization, such as facial and body hair growth and clitoral enlargement. A potential solution is to start taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor after these desired aspects of masculinization have been established.|$|E
2500|$|When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, it was {{revealed}} on February 9, 2006, that he failed a random drug test conducted prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics. [...] The failed test was later revealed {{to be caused by}} a prescription hair loss medication Propecia, which Theodore had been taking legally for eight years. Propecia contains the drug <b>finasteride,</b> which {{can be used as a}} masking agent for the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone among weight-trainers and bodybuilders, but it is not a performance-enhancing drug in itself. Theodore did not face any punishment from the NHL as he had applied and received approval for a therapeutic use exception. Theodore did, however, receive a two-year suspension from international play.|$|E
2500|$|Donors are {{screened}} for health risks {{that could make}} the donation unsafe for the recipient. [...] Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) for HIV risk. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year. A similar change was made in the U.S. in late 2015 by the FDA. [...] Autologous donors are not always {{screened for}} recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or a women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing) medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin, <b>finasteride</b> and dutasteride.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors are overall well-tolerated {{and show}} a low {{incidence}} of adverse effects. Sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate volume, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with <b>finasteride</b> or dutasteride. A small {{increase in the}} risk of affective symptoms including depression, anxiety, and self-harm may be seen. Both the sexual dysfunction and affective symptoms may be due partially or fully to prevention of the synthesis of neurosteroids like allopregnanolone rather necessarily than due to inhibition of DHT production. A very small risk of gynecomastia has been associated with 5α-reductase inhibitors (1.2 to 3.5%). Based on reports of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in males and the effectiveness of 5α-reductase inhibitors for hirsutism in women, reduced body and/or facial hair growth is a likely potential side effect of these drugs in men. There are very few studies evaluating the side effects of 5α-reductase inhibitors in women. However, due to the known role of DHT in male sexual differentiation, 5α-reductase inhibitors may cause birth defects such as ambiguous genitalia in the male fetuses of pregnant women. As such, they are not used in women during pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors like <b>finasteride</b> and {{dutasteride}} inhibit 5α-reductase type II and/or other isoforms and {{are able}} to decrease circulating DHT levels by 65 to 98% depending on the 5α-reductase inhibitor in question. As such, similarly to the case of 5α-reductase type II deficiency, they provide useful insights in the elucidation of the biological functions of DHT. 5α-Reductase inhibitors were developed and are used primarily for the treatment of BPH. The drugs are able to significantly reduce the size of the prostate gland and to alleviate symptoms of the condition. Long-term treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors is also able to significantly reduce the overall risk of prostate cancer, although a simultaneous small increase in the risk of certain high-grade tumors has been observed. In addition to prostate diseases, 5α-reductase inhibitors have subsequently been developed and introduced for the treatment of pattern hair loss in men. They are able to prevent further progression of hair loss in most men with the condition and to produce some recovery of hair in about two-thirds of men. 5α-Reductase inhibitors seem to be less effective for pattern hair loss in women on the other hand, although they do still show some effectiveness. Aside from pattern hair loss, the drugs may be useful in the treatment of other DHT-dependent skin and hair conditions including acne, seborrhea, and hirsutism as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finasteride</b> is a {{medication}} of the 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-ARI, <b>finasteride</b> prevents {{the conversion of}} testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in various tissues including the scalp. Increased hair on the scalp can be seen within three months of starting <b>finasteride</b> treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on the scalp at 24 and 48 months with continued use. Treatment with <b>finasteride</b> more effectively treats male-pattern hair loss at the vertex than male-pattern hair loss {{at the front of}} the head and temples.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Finasteride</b> is {{sometimes}} used in {{hormone replacement therapy}} for transgender women due to its antiandrogen properties, in combination with a form of estrogen [...] However, little clinical research of <b>finasteride</b> use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of efficacy is limited. Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing <b>finasteride</b> to transgender women, as <b>finasteride</b> {{may be associated with}} side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and in others at high risk already.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finasteride</b> {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial and/or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, <b>finasteride</b> produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using <b>finasteride</b> for hirsutism have also found it to be clearly effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finasteride</b> was {{developed}} under the code name MK-906. In 1992, <b>finasteride</b> (5 mg) {{was approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar. In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of <b>finasteride</b> (1 mg) for treatment of MPB, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{no reports}} {{specific}} to dutasteride currently exist, 5α-reductase inhibitors like <b>finasteride</b> {{have been found}} to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial and/or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, <b>finasteride</b> produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction in bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using <b>finasteride</b> for hirsutism have also found it to be clearly effective. Dutasteride may be more effective than <b>finasteride</b> for this indication due to the fact that its inhibition of the 5α-reductase enzyme is comparatively more complete.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 meta {{analysis}} found {{that none of}} the clinical trials testing <b>finasteride</b> in hair loss had adequate safety reporting and did not provide sufficient information to establish the safety profile for <b>finasteride</b> as a treatment for hair loss. The study concluded the existing clinical trials of <b>finasteride</b> for hair loss provide very limited information on toxicity, are of poor quality, and seem to be systematically biased toward under-detection of adverse events. Moreover, the trials submitted to the FDA for approval for hair loss excluded most men who would normally be prescribed <b>finasteride</b> for androgenic alopecia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finasteride</b> {{inhibits}} two 5α-reductase isoenzymes (II and III), while dutasteride inhibits all three. <b>Finasteride</b> potently inhibits 5α-R2 at a mean {{inhibitory concentration}} IC50 of 69 nM, but is less effective with 5α-R1 till an IC50 of 360 nM. <b>Finasteride</b> decreases mean serum level of DHT by 71% after 6 months, and {{was shown in}} vitro to inhibit 5α-R3 at a similar potency to 5α-R2 in transfected cell lines.|$|E
50|$|Management {{may include}} simply {{accepting}} the condition. Otherwise, treatments may include minoxidil, <b>finasteride,</b> or hair transplant surgery. Evidence for <b>finasteride</b> in women, however, is poor {{and it may}} result in birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
