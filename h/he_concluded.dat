Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. <b>He</b> <b>concluded,</b> though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Drenović {{subsequently}} led Serb-chauvinist agitation {{within the}} Partisan 3rd Krajina Detachment. After some vacillation, he eventually {{sided with the}} royalist Chetniks and became a Chetnik commander (vojvoda). In April 1942, he was defeated by the Partisans and fled to Banja Luka, where <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> an alliance with the Ustaše to fight the Partisans. He continued to oppose the Partisans until his death during an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|During Tsang's second term, he {{initiated}} modest {{reforms in}} areas of education, environment and food safety. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> his term, however, when a local news media uncovered evidence of him receiving favours and hospitality from business tycoons on various occasions. This resulted in further discovery of bribery in Tsang's government; then-Chief Secretary of Administration, Rafael Hui, was convicted of corruption in 2014.|$|E
5|$|He claimed similar phallic {{triplets}} {{for several}} other texts. However, {{in the majority}} of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E

5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Sirius {{became the}} first star to have its {{velocity}} measured, {{the beginning of the}} study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov {{was charged}} by the Russian {{government}} with investigating Wallenberg's fate. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka.

5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes {{modelled}} {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion, such as a Neptune-sized object at 1500 AU or a Mars-sized object at around 53 AU.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2011, Jarre {{performed}} a large-scale concert in Monaco {{to celebrate the}} marriage of Prince Albert and his bride Charlene.

5|$|On November 21, 1861, Johnson wrote Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{to request}} Kentucky's {{admission to the}} Confederacy.

5|$|The Fritz Pollard Alliance, a {{non-profit}} organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues, announced its support of a name change in 2015 after repeated attempts {{to discuss the issue}} with the team owner and representatives. An attorney for the Alliance, N. Jeremi Duru, an American University law professor, made a study of the controversy in which <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> that Native Americans are justified in finding the name offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} in Austria only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her personal physician, Gerard van Swieten, {{to investigate the}} claims of vampiric entities. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding {{the end of the}} vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8K in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill became {{convinced}} that the Kansas site could not be the correct one.
