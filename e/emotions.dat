40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of <b>emotion</b> and <b>emotion</b> control in children’s externalizing problems. Third- to sixth-grade children were administered a self-report measure of positive <b>emotion,</b> negative <b>emotion,</b> and <b>emotion</b> control. Peer- and teacher-reported adjustment problems were assessed. Structural equations modeling revealed that negative <b>emotion,</b> especially anger, was important in externalizing problems. Less positive <b>emotion</b> was associated with more external-izing problems. However, when negative <b>emotion</b> was examined in a more differ-entiated manner (anger, sadness and fear), the effect of positive <b>emotion</b> was diminished. Anger consistently emerged as {{a significant predictor of}} behavior problems. No interaction between either positive <b>emotion</b> and <b>emotion</b> control or negative <b>emotion</b> and <b>emotion</b> control was significant. Results showed main effects of each <b>emotion</b> component, with small interaction effects. Methodological and conceptual implications of the findings from the present study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} psychological approaches {{to the meaning of}} <b>emotion</b> terms are presented, namely the dimensional, basic <b>emotion,</b> and componential <b>emotion</b> approaches. According to the dimensional approaches the <b>emotion</b> domain can be represented by a small number of continuous dimensions. The basic <b>emotion</b> approach assumes that the <b>emotion</b> domain is organized into categorically different affect programs. This approach has inspired psycholinguistic research that represents the <b>emotion</b> domain by hierarchical structures. The componential <b>emotion</b> approach represents <b>emotion</b> terms by profiles of activity in each of the <b>emotion</b> components. Although these three approaches are in many respects incompatible {{when it comes to the}} presumed underlying <b>emotion</b> processes, they are compatible with respect to the meaning of <b>emotion</b> terms. The chapter ends by discussing how the GRID paradigm, which is based on the componential <b>emotion</b> approach, can also be fruitfully applied to study categorical and dimensional representations of the <b>emotion</b> domain...|$|R
50|$|Theories on <b>emotion</b> {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of <b>emotion</b> and <b>emotion</b> perception include what type of <b>emotion</b> is perceived, how <b>emotion</b> is perceived somatically, and at what stage of an event <b>emotion</b> is perceived and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
5|$|<b>Emotions</b> are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic <b>emotions</b> to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to <b>emotions,</b> and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the <b>emotions,</b> while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly <b>emotions,</b> which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or <b>emotions</b> (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the <b>emotions.</b> The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the <b>emotions</b> when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the <b>emotions</b> in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to <b>emotions</b> such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

In this paper, we provide a robust and versatile <b>emotion</b> annotation scheme based on cognitive <b>emotion</b> theories, which not only can annotate both explicit and implicit <b>emotion</b> expressions, but also can encode different levels of <b>emotion</b> information for the given <b>emotion</b> content. In addition, motivated by a cognitive framework, an automatic <b>emotion</b> annotation system is developed, and large and comparatively high-quality <b>emotion</b> corpora are created for <b>emotion</b> computing, one in Chinese and the other in English. Such an annotation system can be easily adapted for different kinds of <b>emotion</b> applications and be extended to other languages...|$|R

30|$|In {{the studies}} that are {{specific}} to <b>emotion</b> and language, where the center of concern is the encoding and decoding of <b>emotion</b> in language, {{one of the most}} important tasks is to map the <b>emotion</b> taxonomy to linguistic expressions of <b>emotion</b> (i.e., <b>emotion</b> words and phrases), which would result in a representational model of the <b>emotion</b> lexicon 3. In addition to <b>emotion</b> type and intensity, the third feature that is often coded in an <b>emotion</b> lexicon is valence, which generally speaking, refers to the overall positivity or negativity of the word. Valence judgment (or sentiment classification) of <b>emotion</b> words and emotion-laden words has been carried out in both lines of <b>emotion</b> studies, by psycholinguists and computer scientists, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Natural {{language}} has attracted importance to some researchers working on <b>Emotion</b> recognizing. Our study {{focuses on the}} semi-automatic acquisition technique to obtain the <b>emotion</b> information with the constructed <b>emotion</b> thesaurus we have made. In this paper, we made two models, one is the <b>emotion</b> thesaurus, {{the other is the}} <b>emotion</b> analyzer. Firstly we construct Chinese language <b>emotion</b> thesaurus, the word in which thesaurus has its own classifying of the corresponding <b>emotion</b> information. Secondly, using the thesaurus we set up a model to recognize the object sentence including functions of lexical analysis syntax analysis, <b>emotion</b> sensing and <b>emotion</b> computing. The following investigations are presented to show that the concept of “image value ” can be used by the constructed system to obtain the <b>emotion</b> information from the sentence based on the constructed <b>emotion</b> thesaurus...|$|R

5|$|<b>Emotions</b> debuted at {{the number}} four {{position}} on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 129,000 copies, surprising critics following the success of Mariah Carey (1990). In total, the album spent twenty-seven weeks in the top twenty {{and a total of}} fifty-five on the albums chart, becoming Carey's lowest-peaking album until Glitter (2001). <b>Emotions</b> was certified quadruple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of four million copies within the United States. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album's stateside sales are estimated at 3,595,000. On the Canadian RPM Albums Chart, <b>Emotions</b> debuted at number fourteen, on the issue dated October 5, 1991. Four weeks later, on the issue date November 2, 1991, the album reached its peak position of number six, staying there for one week. At the end of the year, <b>Emotions</b> finished number 35 on the Year-End Albums Chart of 1991. To date, the album has been certified quadruple-platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), denoting shipments of 400,000 units. In Japan, <b>Emotions</b> debuted at number three on the official Oricon chart, and according to Sony Music, has shipped 1,000,000 copies throughout the country. In Australia, the album debuted at number ninety-six on the ARIA Albums Chart during the week ending October 6, 1991, attaining its peak position of number eight four weeks later.

30|$|Strictly speaking, {{variation}} in judgment may exist {{both in the}} understanding of the <b>emotion</b> word (e.g., what <b>emotion</b> is referred to by the word upset) and in the categorization of the encoded <b>emotion</b> (e.g., what <b>emotion</b> type and intensity level the <b>emotion</b> upset belongs to). In this paper, we do not make the distinction between an <b>emotion</b> word and the <b>emotion</b> it refers to (i.e., the word upset vs. the <b>emotion</b> upset), but see Nabi (2002) and Russell (1991) for a discussion on possible differences between the two.|$|R

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate <b>emotions</b> and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking <b>emotions.</b> In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, <b>emotions</b> and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
40|$|Relations between {{parent-child}} <b>emotion</b> {{talk and}} children’s <b>emotion</b> understanding {{were examined in}} 63 Spanish mothers and fathers and their 4 - (M = 53. 35 months, SD = 3. 86) and 6 -year-old (M = 76. 62 months, SD = 3. 91) children. Parent-child <b>emotion</b> talk was analyzed during two storytelling tasks: a play-related storytelling task and a reminiscence task (conversation about past experiences). Children’s <b>emotion</b> understanding was assessed twice through a standardized test of <b>emotion</b> comprehension (TEC; Pons, Harris, & de Rosnay, 2004), once before {{one of the two}} parent-child storytelling sessions and again six months later.

40|$|Implicit <b>emotion</b> {{regulation}} {{defined as}} goal-driven processes modulates <b>emotion</b> experiences and responses automatically without awareness. However, the temporal course of implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation is not clear. To address these issues, we adopted a new Priming-identify task (PI task) to manipulate implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation directly and observed the changes of early (N 170), middle (early posterior negativity, EPN), and late event-related potentials (ERPs) components (late positivity potentials, LPP) under the different implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation conditions. The behavioral {{results indicated that}} the PI task manipulated subjective <b>emotion</b> experience effectively by priming <b>emotion</b> regulation goals. The ERP results found that implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation induced more negative N 170 without altering the EPN and the LPP amplitudes, indicating that implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation occured automatically in the early perceptual stage not in the late selective attention stage of <b>emotion</b> processing. The correlation analysis also found the enlarged N 170 was associated with decreased negative <b>emotion</b> subjective rating, suggesting that the N 170 was probably an effective index of implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation. These observations imply that implicit <b>emotion</b> regulation probabbly occurs in the early stage of <b>emotion</b> processing automatically without consciousness. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} links between <b>emotion</b> {{processing}} and social participation in the acute and chronic phases of stroke. Three aspects of <b>emotion</b> processing are examined: 1) <b>Emotion</b> Perception 2) <b>Emotion</b> Regulation 3) Depression and Anxiety. Social Participation refers to engagement in life situations including a range of social activities and social networks. Stroke survivors are known to experience a reduction in social participation, independently of activity limitations. The current research tests the hypothesis that impairments {{in any of the}} aspects of <b>emotion</b> processing may affect social participation. Previous research has established that following stroke, difficulties in <b>emotion</b> perception and depression and anxiety occur, but there is little research on post stroke <b>emotion</b> regulation difficulties. While the link between post stroke depression and anxiety and social participation has been explored, {{this is not the case}} with <b>emotion</b> perception or <b>emotion</b> regulation. In a pilot study, <b>emotion</b> processing and social participation measures were administered to stroke patients. <b>Emotion</b> processing difficulties were shown to occur in stroke survivors and were significantly correlated with social participation. In the main study participants’ <b>emotion</b> processing, social participation and activity limitations were assessed at 2 and 18 months post stroke. In the acute phase, all three aspects of <b>emotion</b> processing correlated with social participation, but only <b>emotion</b> regulation predicted social participation restrictions independently of activity limitations. In the chronic phase, <b>emotion</b> processing correlated with social participation, with <b>emotion</b> regulation and depression predicting social participation independently of activity limitations. Further analyses revealed acute phase problems with <b>emotion</b> perception predicted chronic phase social participation limitations, while acute phase social participation restrictions predicted chronic phase depression and <b>emotion</b> regulation. These findings highlight the importance of {{the links between}} <b>emotion</b> processing and social participation post stroke. Future research priorities in this field are outlined.
