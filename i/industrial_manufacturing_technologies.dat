40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{set out to}} achieve two major objectives. The first {{is to examine the}} {{philosophy}} underlying the technology decisions in Malaysian Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) manufacturing companies. The second objective is to identify and validate factors impacting the technology decisions in Malaysian manufacturing companies. A mixed methodology has been utilized to answer three research questions. The mixed methodology involves two phases which are the quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The exploratory sequential design is the specific mixed methods design employed in this study. The purpose of the two-phase, exploratory mixed methods study was to explore participants&rsquo; views with the intention of using the information to validate the construct developed based on the literature and past researches, investigating new constructs to be included in this study, refining the questionnaire and further testing the hypotheses. The researcher conducted Study 1, a qualitative pre-study interview of the selected companies to obtain as much information and data as possible {{to be included in the}} questionnaire survey to be made useful in Study 2. Study 1 was conducted using semi-structured interview questions. The objectives were to show the reason for Malaysian manufacturing SMEs engagement in technology adoption and to validate the existing variables and determine more variables to incorporate into a choice-based survey questionnaire. The first finding shows that the reason of the technology decision by Malaysian manufacturing SMEs lies in survival. Based on the second major finding, the researcher has found that there are significant factors to be included in the initial theoretical framework for this study; cost and top management commitment. Based on the literature, both factors have been tested empirically in some prior research of technology adoption by other authors. This indicates the importance of these factors to be included in the proposed theoretical framework. Additionally, the researcher builds new hypotheses for both. Further investigation is presented in Study 2. For Study 2, the researcher has conducted the questionnaire survey with a sample number of Malaysian manufacturing SMEs in order to gauge ample relevant information required to achieve the research objectives. In Study 2, the researcher analysed the stages using the Factor Analysis and found that from five stages proposed by Rogers (1962), they then became two stages. These were renamed the &lsquo;Initiation&rsquo; stage which consists of knowledge, persuasion, and decision stages and &lsquo;Implementation&rsquo; stage which consists of implementation and confirmation stages with some items dropped. Furthermore, multiple regression revealed the significant predictors technology decision process by Malaysian manufacturing SMEs. The factors that influence the initiation stage of the technology decision process are: technology attributes (relative advantages, complexity), organizational factors (adhocracy culture, top management support), and external environment factors (environmental dynamism, environmental hostility). The factors that influence the implementation stage of the technology decision process are similar to the initiation stage for organizational factors and external environment factors. The difference technology attributes namely compatibility and complexity that influence the implementation stage of the technology decision process. Based on the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, and findings of Study 2, the model for the technology decision process in Malaysian manufacturing SMEs is suggested to illustrate the technology decision process in Malaysian manufacturing SMEs. This thesis allows the understanding of the technology decision process with the intention to facilitate manufacturing companies&rsquo; decision makers to consider and plan potential adoption of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies.</b> At a practical level, the findings from the research provide important implications towards Malaysian manufacturing companies&rsquo; decision makers and stakeholders regarding technology adoption. The discussion reveals that the understanding of process behaviour may accelerate technology diffusion and tighten links between technology developers and users/adopters, as well as create and nurture supportive systems and infrastructure for technology diffusion. The outcomes also contribute to the theoretical understanding of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technologies</b> adoption and diffusion by manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia...|$|E

Due to their complex emission spectra, trace levels of REEs are difficult to analyze by conventional ICP-AES techniques. The present study investigates possible spectral interferences of matrices (rare earth oxides of Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Dy) on the analytical lines (+/- 0. 1 nm) of a target REE. Detailed and well-resolved spectra for selected REEs are presented, and procedures used to rectify the problem of spectral interferences caused by REE matrices are discussed. A computer-assisted system (GAS) for spectral recognition has been developed and used {{to assist in the}} study of matrix interference. To determine directly trace {{rare earth elements}} in REE matrices without sample pre-separation, the application potential is demonstrated with a one meter sequential instrument retrofitted with a 3600 grooves/mm grating.

Authorities in a variety of fields – including evolutionary economics, innovation and regeneration studies, urban modelling and history – re-evaluate their disciplines within this framework. The book explores the complex dynamic processes that give rise to socio-economic change over space and time, with reference to empirical cases including the emergence of knowledge-intensive industries and decline of mature regions, the operation of innovative networks and the evolution of localities and cities. Sustainability is a persistent theme and the practicability of intervention is examined in the light of these perspectives. Specialists in disciplines that include economics, evolutionary theory, innovation, <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>technology</b> change, and archaeology will find much to interest them in this book. In addition, the strong interdisciplinary emphasis of the book will attract a non-specialist audience interested in keeping abreast of current theoretical and methodological approaches through evidence-based and practical examples...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} two scale {{method for}} {{the prediction of}} tensile and bending stiffness and strength of medium density ﬁberboards (MDF) is proposed with the aim to study the ﬁber orientation inﬂuence on mechanical properties of MDF. The method requires less experi- mental data to optimize MDF and to improve <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technology</b> of MDF. A new method for computing orientation tensors of the compressed ﬁber network is proposed. First, the virtual microstructure is generated by simulations of a ﬁber lay- down and a subsequent compression to obtain the necessary density. The density proﬁle, ﬁber length, thickness, and orientation are used for the microstructure generation, which are obtained from lCT images and image analysis tools. Then a new damage model for the wood ﬁber cell walls and joints is introduced. The microstructural problem is formu- lated as a Lippmann–Schwinger type equation in elasticity and solved by using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The macroscopic three point bending test is simulated with hexahe- dral ﬁnite elements and analytical methods based on Euler–Bernoulli theory. The differ- ence between bending strength and stiffness numerically obtained and corresponding experimentally measured values is less than 10 %. This study lays a foundation for the opti- mal design of MDF ﬁber structures and the optimization of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing</b> pro- cesses.

40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the nonlinear steady state boundary layer flow and heat transfer of an incompressible Jeffery non-Newtonian fluid from a permeable horizontal isothermal cylinder. The transformed conservation equations are solved numerically subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions using a versatile, implicit, finite-difference technique. The numerical code is validated with previous studies. The {{influence of a}} number of emerging non-dimensional parameters, namely with Deborah number (De), surface suction parameter (S), Prandtl number (Pr), ratio of relaxation to retardation times (λ) and dimensionless tangential coordinate (ξ) on velocity and temperature evolution in the boundary layer regime are examined in detail. Furthermore, the effects of these parameters on surface heat transfer rate and local skin friction are also investigated. It is found that the velocity is reduced with increasing Deborah number whereas temperature is enhanced. Increasing λ enhances the velocity but reduces the temperature. The heat transfer rates is found to be depressed with increasing Deborah number, De, and enhanced with increasing λ. Local skin friction is found to be decreased with a rise in Deborah number whereas it is elevated with increasing values of relaxation to retardation time ratio (λ). Increasing suction decelerates the flow and cools the boundary layer i. e. reduces temperatures. With increasing tangential coordinate, the flow is also decelerated whereas the temperatures are enhanced. The simulation is relevant to polymer coating thermal processing. Polymeric enrobing flows are important in <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>technology</b> and process systems. Such flows are non-Newtonian.

40|$|According to {{standard}} literature on development economics, development processes may cause dualism. Dualism {{means that there}} are huge sectors (or regions) with modern technology as well as small sectors (or regions) with traditional technology. As far as development policies are concerned, the dualism is a disturbing problem. Because dualism reflects inequality and may cause socially ramified impacts. Alleviating tension of dualism implicitly should becomes a goal of policy makers. If {{we assume that the}} level of <b>industrial</b> (<b>manufacturing)</b> <b>technology</b> is measured in term of capital-labor ratio, the increases in capital-labor ratio in manufacturing represent an improvement in industrial technological capability. Thus, under the paradigm of dual-industrial growth, the problem Indonesia faces {{is whether or not the}} growth of capital-intensive industries exceeds those of labor-intensive ones. So, the central problem sent to this research is: Does dualism within manufacturing sectors exist? By employing the input-output analysis, this research finds Indonesian manufacturing sector can be considered dualistic in its size and export-import structure. There are significant disparity between capital-intensive industries and labor-intensive ones. Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Menurut literatur standard ekonomika pembangunan, proses pembangunan ekonomi bisa menyebabkan dualisme. Dualisme berarti ada sektor besar dengan kemampuan modern berdampingan dan tumbuh bersamaan dengan sektor kecil dengan kemampuan tradisional. Dualisme ekonomi ini bisa berdampak sosial sebab ia mencerminkan ketimpangan (inequality). Sehingga secara implisit meredakan tensi dualisme merupakan salah satu tujuan kebijakan ekonomi. Jika dianggap bahwa level kemampuan sektor industri diukur dengan rasio modal per tenaga kerja, maka peningkatan rasio ini mencerminkan peningkatan kapabilitas teknologi sektor industri. Jadi, menurut paradigma dual-industrial growth, masalah yang dihadapi Indonesia adalah: "Adakah dualisme di dalam sektor manufaktur?" Dengan menerapkan analisis input-output, studi ini melihat bahwa sektor manufaktur Indonesia dapat dianggap dualistis dalam hal besarnya dan struktur eskpor-impornya. Di samping itu, adan disparitas yang signifikan antara kelompok industri padat modal dan kelompok industri padat karya. Kata kunci:. dualisme, perubahan struktural, input-output analisis...|$|R
