2500|$|The {{biosphere}} reserve in Querétaro is managed by Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas of Semarnat [...] The management {{system is a}} combination of federal authorities working with the participation of local communities. The land is generally not owned by the government. Thirty percent of the reserve is communally owned land with the rest privately owned, with the government issuing regulations. Cooperation between federal authorities and local communities has not always gone smoothly, with local residents complaining that the government has issues decrees without consulting them. [...] The CESG and the biosphere project have attracted international support from sponsors such as the Schwab Foundation, Shell, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Grupo Bimbo and nongovernmental organizations such as , conservation foundations and U.N. agencies. The Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda was one of 94 winners of the Energy Globe competition among 700 entrants. It received 10,000 Euros to help fund its projects. Conservation of the area has also attracted the attention of people such as director James Cameron, who sponsored a reforestation project on 120 hectares. This is in addition to various other reforestation projects that have been ongoing since the 1990s. These projects even include an overall <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> designed to produce enough wood for local woodcutters to earn a living.|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{upon the}} {{historical}} framework {{of origin and}} development, and a long tradition in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> in Slovenia and Croatia, and based on a survey of literature and research to date, this paper addresses problems and perspectives of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning.</b> Comparison is made of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> concepts, which generally differ {{from country to country}} in terms of natural, social and economic circumstances. Impacts of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> on the condition and trends in forest resources are discussed. Perspectives of <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>management</b> are viewed as a permanent and continuous task. This task involves sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> through the development of integral and close-to-nature management. Within the adaptive approach to management as the main focus of future planning development, the core elements of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> are discussed: planning as a process, inventory and planning, project planning and design, team work, importance of management monitoring and analyses, spatial levels of planning, and finally, creativity and restrictions of adaptive management. Involvement of the public and of all interested subjects in the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> process is highlighted as an essential prerequisite for developing a planning approach, and so is the establishment of an efficient system of private <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> and entrepreneurship...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate the use of NDFI images (Normalized Difference Fraction Index) for assessing <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> in the Amazon region. To do this, we combined the digital maps of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> from the States of Pará and Mato Grosso with NDFI images. This procedure allowed us to identify authorized (<b>forest</b> <b>management)</b> and non-authorized (illegal logging) timber harvesting, and to integrate this information with information from the forest control systems to assess the status of the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Finally, we assessed the qualify of the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> using fieldcalibrated NDFI thresholds: NDFI 0. 84 indicating low quality (predatory logging); NDFI between 0. 85 and 0. 89, intermediate quality (there was an attempt at adopting management, but the configuration of roads, log landings and clearings reveals serious harvest planning problems); and NDFI 0. 90, good quality, reduced impact logging as a results of better <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> Our analyses reviewed that t 85 % of the logged area in Pará was unauthorized, while only 15 % authorized by the environmental agency. As for Mato Grosso, the unauthorized logged area represented 39 % against 61 % of authorized. Intermediate quality in <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> was predominanted in Pará (65 %) and in Mato Grosso (52 %). Yet, large areas of the authorized <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> in Pará (23 %) and Mato Grosso (41 %) showed low quality for timber harvesting. We also identified several problems in execution of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> in those States, such as logging carried out before logging authorization, area deforested before logging authorization, logged area beyond the authorized boundaries, among others.

40|$|The <b>Forest</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Planning</b> Package {{represents}} a general fundamental {{structure of a}} <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> system based on two inventory phases. It is an existing calculation system used in practical forestry in Sweden. The <b>Forest</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Planning</b> Package integrates economic theory, objective inventory measurements and accurate growth forecasts.

Detailed growth forecasts and economic calculations with high resolution (individual trees) permit analysis of various silvicultural treatment options in all types of Swedish stands. A non-linear objective function and mathematical optimization result in a compromise between maximum net present value and sustained net-revenue profile. Application of the system contributes to a much improved economic result through the removal of uncertainties concerning the real production possibilities and it has significantly altered the management strategies of the forest companies that have implemented it...|$|R
