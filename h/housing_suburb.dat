50|$|Radford in {{the parish}} of Plymstock in Devon is an {{historic}} manor, the oldest recorded seat of the prominent Harris family.

However, various traces of the estate remain, including most notably the deerpark, now a public amenity known as Radford Park, with its large lake, an early 19th century gate-lodge at the entrance drive to the former mansion house, with gatepiers, on Radford Park Road, a bridge and boathouse with follies of a sham castle and another sham-ruin.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, for {{the second}} time since {{becoming}} Prime Minister, Howard came up short of a majority in the first count for the seat. He was assured of re-election on the third count, ultimately winning 53.3 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. The two-party-preferred vote for the Liberals declined 3.4% in the 2004 election, contrary to a strong national trend to the Coalition (and a particularly strong one to the Coalition in outer-suburban metropolitan seats), making Bennelong a marginal seat at that time, with a margin of just 4.3%. The 2006 redistribution pushed this margin slightly further into Labor territory, due to the inclusion of the predominantly working-class and public <b>housing</b> <b>suburb</b> of Ermington in Bennelong's boundaries. The Greens increased their vote at this election by 12.34% to 16.37% at this election, owing to the pre-selection of the high-profile Andrew Wilkie as candidate.|$|E

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1976, when the {{property}} of Highlands was being subdivided for suburban residential use that the name of Eagle Vale surfaced once again, {{to be applied to}} the new subdivision between the newly developed suburb of Eschol Park and the public housing estate of Claymore. In 1978, the first housing lots were released, and several land releases continued into the 1980s, with some smaller releases continuing into the early 1990s. The relatively low price of the land meant that it quickly attracted first home buyers, often young families. Eagle Vale, much like the rest of Campbelltown area, has often attracted an unfortunate reputation for being a somewhat undesirable suburb, an attitude that is compounded by its proximity to the public <b>housing</b> <b>suburb</b> of Claymore which itself is often negatively perceived. This negative image of Claymore even prompted residents of privately owned houses in the suburb to lobby for the suburb borders to be altered in order to place them into Eagle Vale, which was eventually achieved in 1986. This explains why some of the streets on {{the eastern side of the}} suburb have names following Claymore's street naming theme, Great Australian Artists, such as Albert Namatjira, rather than Eagle Vale's theme of minerals and gemstones, such as Emerald, Cameo and Aquamarine.|$|E

These interrelated forms of memory influence understanding of place and sense of place. Personal memories corroborate and collaborate with intersubjective memories to inform collective memory. Both personal and collective memories are held within a fusion of cultural myths. Evolved memory binds us deeply within {{the history of the}} earth and the evolution of life. Risdon Vale provides fertile ground for considerations of place and memory. This former public <b>housing</b> <b>suburb</b> is adjacent to Risdon Cove, the site of first occupation by the British in 1803 and the site of the first massacre of Aboriginal Tasmanians in 1804...|$|E
40|$|State housing {{areas are}} an {{accepted}} and typical {{part of the}} New Zealand urban landscape. However, {{little research has been}} carried out on this topic and existing findings in the disciplines of geography, sociology, education and architecture are largely unrelated. The need for further and more intensive investigation has been stressed by Pool in his study of the areal groupings of the social characteristics of inhabitants of the Auckland urban area. Pool defined State housing areas as one of his ten 'social regions' and concluded that "State suburbs are unique and their character and problems require separate research". 1 Pool, 1959 (a), 115. This thesis aims to investigate the physical characteristics of a state <b>housing</b> <b>suburb</b> and the demographic and social characteristics of its residents. The hypothesis will be explored that within a suburb planned by the State, different policies on housing administration have led to different demographic patterns. The name 'Takaro' is applied loosely and inconsistently by residents in Palmerston North to a wide area {{to the west of the}} city. For the purposes of this thesis Takaro is defined as the part on the outskirts of the city that was planned as an entity by the Housing Division of the Ministry of Works, also including Monrad Street as a boundary (Figure 3). Takaro covers an area of 287 acres and contained in August 1969 an estimated 3, 368 people. It is a relatively new <b>housing</b> <b>suburb,</b> for the main period of building construction was between 1959 and 1966. The majority of houses are State-built (52 per cent) or State-financed group houses (22 per cent). The remaining private houses include a number built for the Department of Maori Affairs. This study consists of a survey and an analysis of findings and their implications. The basic research tool was an interview survey carried out in order to gain information related to the aims of the thesis. The nature of the survey and the methods used are detailed in Appendix A. The work is in three parts. The first establishes the legislative setting, in which the introduction of State housing in New Zealand, its growth and development are outlined. The second consists of the study of Takaro, its physical growth and structure, and of the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the residents and their patterns of community interaction. In the third part the implications of State policies are discussed upon the basis of research findings and suggestions are made for future policies. The author is grateful for the supervision and encouragement of Professor K. W. Thomson and Mr B. G. R. Saunders of the Geography Department, Massey University. Appreciation is also extended to the members of the Housing Division of the Ministry of Works, Palmerston North, for their very willing assistance; to the Town Planning Department of the Palmerston North City Council for their co-operation and providing the base map for Figure 3; to Mr B. J. Allen for his constructive criticism; to Miss D. Scott of the Central Photographic Unit, Massey University, for reproduction of photographs, maps and graphs and to Mrs J. C. Herbert for typing the final manuscript.

40|$|Improvements in technology, {{transport}} and communication have given people choice {{on where to}} live and conduct business. Today, place managers have the ability {{and the opportunity to}} design and implement activities to attract and/or retain residents in a particular place. Place marketing literature has given limited consideration to place attachment and whether it can {{play a role in the}} process of attracting and retaining residents to a place. Place attachment is the bond between people and their place. Place scale in this study includes house (single family home or apartment), suburb (spatially limited area from a block to a section of the city) and city (mix of housing, demographics). Following a review of place attachment studies, place attachment was measured relative to its physical (form and space) and social (emotional) dimensions and applied to the scale of <b>house,</b> <b>suburb</b> and city. Seven hypotheses were tested based on attachment and gender, age, income, length of residency, suburb of residency, property ownership and living situation. The chi-square statistic was significant for five of the seven hypotheses. This research shows that place attachment is not a unitary concept. The variables tested show differences in the relationship with place attachment and also between the place scales of <b>house,</b> <b>suburb</b> and city. The findings show that place marketers need to understand the types of attachment that is important to different residents if successful resident attraction/retention strategies are to occur. The questionnaire developed in this thesis can effectively measure place attachment and aid more informed decisions for the betterment of places...|$|R
