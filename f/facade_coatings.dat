40|$|The use of {{external}} thermal insulation systems (ETICs) {{is a powerful}} instrument in the energetic improvement of residential buildings. With that measure, the façade surface is thermally decoupled from the wall construction and consequently the humidity balance on the façade changes. This fact leads to better conditions {{for the growth of}} microorganisms. Therefore biocidal ingredients are often added to <b>façade</b> <b>coatings.</b> To evaluate the effectiveness and the durability of biocidal equipped <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> a comprehensive research project was conducted at the Holzkirchen branch of the Fraunhofer-Institute for Building Physics. 33 different types of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> were applied to test specimen and exposed to real weathering conditions for five years. The general efficiency of the biocidal equipping of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> could be proven. The development of biological growth on biocidal equipped <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> was significantly reduced, showing much less species than without biocide. Depending on the type of the coating, different biocides show a varying durability within the coatings. This has an influence on the species involved in the primary colonization. The biocide content in the coating itself allows no prediction of the susceptibility to biological growth. <b>Façade</b> <b>coatings</b> with biocidal paints showed better results than biocidal renders without additional paint coating...|$|E

40|$|Growth {{of algae}} and fungi {{is a well}} known {{phenomenon}} on exterior building surfaces. Modern <b>façade</b> <b>coatings,</b> especially coatings based on organic resins, therefore contain antimicrobial agents. The biocides are meant to inhibit {{or at least to}} delay microbiological growth significantly. Visible microbiological activity in the form of coloured spots is accepted as deficit in German prevailing law cases. Besides juristic aspects the leaching of biocidal ingredients from coatings may also have environmental effects and points out the necessity for product optimisation to minimize the impact of biocides on water and soil. In a four year outdoor study the behaviour of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> equipped with different biocidal agents was examined. Special test specimen based on external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) were designed and furnished with different <b>façade</b> <b>coatings.</b> The coatings contained four different mixtures of biocides. In sum, 20 different types were exposed to real climatic conditions at two locations in Germany. At defined times the biocide content to the coatings was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Additionally, the run-off water from the specimen was collected and analyzed. In all coatings the concentrations of the active ingredients declined {{depending on the type of}} the ingredient and the matrix. In the run-off water the highest concentrations were found within the first three months of exposure. The results show clearly that the decrease of the antimicrobial ingredients in the coatings can not only be explained by leaching. Other ways of release are also possible, as well as the formation of transformation or degradation products...|$|E
30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Sources of organic micropollutants {{occuring}} in surface waters are often unknown. Regarding environmental risk assessments for surface waters, construction materials have as till now, not been given much consideration, although biocides used as preservatives are known to reach urban storm water runoff. The study focused on biocides for <b>facades</b> <b>coatings</b> and aimed (1) to determine ecotoxicological effect values, (2) to quantify the leaching behaviour and (3) to assess the environmental risk for surface waters using a dynamic transport model.|$|R

40|$|Rainwater {{runoff from}} {{building}} facades {{is a complex}} process governed by {{a wide range of}} urban, building, material and meteorological parameters. Given this complexity and the wide range of influencing parameters, {{it is not surprising that}} despite research efforts spanning over almost a century, wind-driven rain and rainwater runoff are still very active research subjects. Accurate knowledge of rainwater runoff is important for hygrothermal and durability analyses of building facades, assessment of indirect evaporative cooling by water films on facades to mitigate outdoor and indoor overheating, assessment of the self-cleaning action of <b>facade</b> surface <b>coatings</b> and leaching of particles from surface coatings that enter the water cycle as hazardous pollutants. Research on rainwater runoff is performed by field observations, field measurements, laboratory measurements and analytical and numerical modelling. While field observations are many, up to now, field experiments and modelling efforts are few and have been almost exclusively performed for plain facades without facade details. Field observations, often based on a posteriori investigation of the reasons for differential surface soiling, are important because they have provided and continue to provide very valuable qualitative information on runoff, which is very difficult to obtain in any other way. Quantitative measurements are increasing, but are still very limited in relation to the wide range of influencing parameters. To the knowledge of the authors, current state-of-the-art hygrothermal models do not yet contain runoff models. The development, validation and implementation of such models into hygrothermal models is required to supplement observational and experimental research efforts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A broad outdoor {{weathering}} {{experimental study}} was conducted to gain better insight into whether for future building product authorization in Europe mortars and plasters could be classified as products without testing / products without further testing (WT/WFT). To cover a wide range of mineral building products for outdoor use, worst-case-formulations were created in cooperation with industry. In a three year outdoor weathering experiment elution tests of mortars and plasters for outdoor use were performed. Leaching results were recorded and evaluated. The concentration of dangerous compounds in the rainwater running down the test specimen is not suitable for assessing the environmental impact of weathered <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> because filtration by soil and dilution by other rain water is not considered. Also an existing evaluation scheme for the environmental impact of concrete in direct contact with groundwater cannot be applied. Under real conditions there is no direct correlation between substance concentration in the run-off water and the amount of substance released. It could be shown that elution of compounds of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> under real conditions are in most cases below the prescriptive limits...|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{biocidal}} products, such as wood preservatives and film preservatives in <b>facade</b> <b>coatings,</b> are submitted to a detailed environmental risk assessment under the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012. Laboratory leaching tests for biocidal products that are based either on constant or intermittent water contact, as well as semi-field tests, are listed in a guidance document of the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA. These tests also apply to biocidal products that are included in construction products [33].|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Concentrations {{with high}} {{environmental}} risk are expected at new facades, especially at facades with thermal insulation. With the given low predicted no effect concentrations {{in a range}} of a few ng/L and large amounts of biocides applied in paints and renders, the environmental risk for common biocides used in <b>facade</b> <b>coatings</b> has to be investigated in laboratory and field scale. It seems plausible that source control measures as the most efficient and sustainable precautionary principle need to be evaluated.|$|E

40|$|CEN TC 351 WG 1 {{is working}} on release {{scenarios}} for dangerous substances from building materials into the soil and groundwater. Therefore, different laboratory methods for the estimation of substance release are being discussed. In the evaluation scheme proposed by the German Working Group on Water Issues (Bund/Länder Arbeitsgemeinschaft Wasser, LAWA), concentration values are given for organic and inorganic substances, which are considered as non-critical for the groundwater. Results of laboratory leaching experiments are commonly used as input values for this evaluation scheme. The scope of these experiments is focussed on building elements {{in direct contact with}} the groundwater. To date no long-time real-climate surveys of irrigated façade materials regarding the leaching of organic and inorganic matter have been published. In a three year experiment, test speciments of mineral plasters and mortars were exposed to real climate conditions. The concentrations of selected organic and inorganic compounds in the run off rain water were measured after nearly each rainfall. Comparing concentrations or release rates measured for a single rainfall with the insignificance threshold values, shows that there is no simple way of evaluating the release behaviour of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> using the values derived from building elements in direct contact with the groundwater. The release mechanisms of <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> under real climatic conditions are, due to the intermittent water contact, quite different. Concentrations and release rates determined in the exposition experiment give important about the leaching characteristics of plasters and mortars...|$|E
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} Eight {{biocides}} used in resin based <b>facade</b> <b>coatings</b> were investigated. Some biocides are substances known as pesticides for agricultural purposes like diuron, carbendazim and terbutryn. Ecotoxicological effect values for aquatic organisms were determined for every biocide. Leaching of four biocides from a render under UV-irradiation {{has been investigated}} in the laboratory including the influence of varying temperatures. Using 80 irrigation intervals over 28 days, facade runoff was sampled and followed by biocide chemical analysis. The total losses were calculated based on the concentration patterns. These data were used for modelling the transport of cybutryn from facades to surface waters. Biocide specific effect values and leaching characteristics have been taken into consideration.|$|E
40|$|Release of {{biocides}} from hydrophobic fa ade coatings: encapsulated vs. non-capsulated biocide systems. Due {{to driving}} rain biocidal active substances, which prevent or delay the overgrow of fa ades with algae and fungi, can be leached {{out of the}} <b>facade</b> <b>coatings.</b> For the past 10 years encapsulated active substances are increasingly used. During a one year field trial the leaching of the substances Terbutryn (2 -Methylthio- 4 -tert-butylamino- 1, 3, 5 triazine), Diuron (DCMU, 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea), IPBC (3 -Iodoprop- 2 -ynyl-N-butylcarbamate), OIT (2 -n-Octyl-isothiazolin- 3 -one) and DCOIT (4, 5 -Di-chloro- 2 -n-octyl-isothiazolin- 3 one) have been investigated in capsulated and non-capsulated form. It shows that a well adjusted rate of encapsulation of the active substances could significantly reduce the release (up to 85 % in case of Diuron) from highly hydrophobic fa ade coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of thermal insulation standard of buildings causes {{a much higher}} risk of infestation by black fungi or algae on <b>facade</b> <b>coatings.</b> The fundamental criterion for the risk of microbial infestation on facades is the availability of sufficient amounts of humidity. For this, night time condensation is most relevant. Compared to monolithic walls, walls with external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) are most vulnerable. Therefore especially for those systems, methods against microbial infestation are in demand. While during the last decades the aim was always lower water absorption coefficients, peaking in ultra-hydrophobic systems, it is now tending towards hygric optimisation with slightly hydrophilic systems. But {{there will always be}} climatic and micro-climatic habitat conditions which make the use of biocidal active agents unavoidable. Even the equipment with active compounds is subject to naturally given processes like leaching which in medium and long term notedly reduce their permanence and the durability of the façade coating against biological infestation. The interaction of active agent combination, coating type, building physical und climatic conditions also has a crucial relevance...|$|E
40|$|Red, {{green and}} blue paints were {{prepared}} for use as thickness insensitive spectrally selective (TISS) paint coatings for solar façade absorbers. The paints were composed of a polyurethane resin binder in which various pigments were incorporated {{in such a way}} that they formed stable paint dispersions, satisfying stability criteria for <b>façade</b> <b>coatings.</b> A low emittance of the paints was achieved by using low-emittance aluminium flake pigments combined with iron oxide (red coloured paints). Black pigment was added to adjust solar absorptance. Blue and green paints were made by the addition of coloured aluminium flake pigment and the solar absorptance was also adjusted by the addition of black pigment. Efficiency for photo-thermal conversion of solar radiation was assessed by evaluation of the corresponding performance criteria, which enabled the selection of paints whose performance criteria values were higher than 0 (spectrally non-selective black coating). The results confirmed that blue and green paints and to minor extent red ones, combined selectivity with colour. The morphology of the paints was assessed, revealing that the colours originated from the deposition of finely dispersed colour and/or black pigment on the surface of the aluminium flakes during paint preparation...|$|E
40|$|There are two European {{standards}} describing {{test methods}} {{for the evaluation}} of the leaching properties and the environmental impact of construction materials in contact with water. CEN/TS 16637 - 2 is a harmonised horizontal testing method developed by CEN/TC 351 WG 1 derived from a Dutch standard and a German guideline for concrete in permanent contact with groundwater, a so-called dynamic surface leaching test. During this 64 -day test a specimen is stored under water. The water is replaced for eight times and the samples are not allowed to dry during this procedure. The test according EN 16105 is derived from a procedure for wood preservatives. It is deemed to be a test method suitable to evaluate the leaching behaviour of renders like <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> in intermittent contact with water within three weeks. Depending on the analytes and on the mortar or render types the findings of both laboratory experiments are quite different. So up to now {{it is not possible to}} decide which laboratory test reflects better the behaviour of the renders under real climate conditions. Therefore a large number of mineral and organic renders were exposed to the real climate and also subjected to both standardised tests. A set of sum parameters and compounds were analysed to get a first overview of the substance release under different experimental and realistic conditions. Compound concentrations in the leachates and the runoff are compared...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the 1960 s and 70 s {{extensive}} experimental investigations {{were carried}} out at the open air test site of the Fraunhofer-Institute of Building Physics concerning the driving rain protection of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) walls coated with innovative synthetic resin renders. Since some of the exposed test walls did not perform as well as others, a correlation between the water absorption and the vapour diffusion properties of the <b>façade</b> <b>coatings</b> was established. This correlation was subsequently introduced into the German Standard for exterior rendering systems with a slight modification {{to account for the}} special characteristics of mineral renders. When models to simulate transient heat and moisture transport processes in the building envelope were successfully applied {{in the middle of the}} 90 s, parametric studies confirmed that the empirical correlation, established 30 years ago, is appropriate to define the rain protection characteristics of façade systems. However, the magnitude of the parameters depends on the climate conditions and the wall assembly. While the existing specifications are suitable for moderately insulating masonry, walls made out of well-insulated blocks may get too wet. Similarly, masonry structures with interior insulation may accumulate too much moisture behind the insulation layer unless the existing limit for the water absorption coefficient is reduced by 60 % for high wind driven rain zones. Recent calculation results show that the local driving rain load and intermittent drying conditions as well as the characteristics of the substrate are the principle factors for selecting limit criteria for rain protecting rendering systems...|$|E
