In doing so, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration and error correction model are applied to test the long run and short run relationships, respectively. The direction of causality between the variables is investigated by the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality test and robustness of causality analysis is tested by applying innovative accounting approach (IAA). The analysis confirms cointegration {{for the long run}} relation between exports, <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development in case of Pakistan. The results indicate that <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development spur exports growth in Pakistan. The causality analysis reveals feedback hypothesis that exists between <b>financial</b> development <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> growth, <b>financial</b> development <b>and</b> exports, <b>and,</b> exports <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> growth. This study provides new insights for policy makers to sustain exports growth by stimulating <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> developing <b>financial</b> sector in Pakistan. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{objective}} of the thesis is to evaluate connection between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development. Especially, identify if there is causal relationship between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development. Previous studies are still in disagreement of causal relationship. Therefore, the thesis tries to clarify this connection. The study concentrates its efforts on developing markets, particularly on Russian <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> its effect on financial development. Previously, the growth-finance relationship concerning the Russian market has been omitted, hence, the thesis is trying to fulfill this gap. The study uses cointegration and Granger causality tests, as well as case-study analysis to evaluate the link <b>and</b> causality between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development. DATA The data in the thesis is obtained from variety of different sources. Empirical {{part of the study}} utilized data from International Financial Statistics reports published by the International Monetary Fund. The data measures <b>economic</b> growth, <b>financial</b> development, <b>and</b> capital markets in Russia and other countries for the period of 1995 - 2008. The case study part employed diverse sources of data such as the Russian Federal State Statistic Service, International Monetary Fund database, The Central Bank of Russian Federation, BankScope and others. RESULTS The empirical results of the study indicate there might be bi-directional causality between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> development. Moreover, the empirical study did not find any effect of country’s economic development on the growth-finance relationship. Additionally, the outcomes indicate the growth-finance relationship being country specific. In terms of Russia, the results demonstrate there is demand-leading relationship between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> efficiency, {{at the same time a}} bidirectional causal relationship between <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> equity markets...|$|R
