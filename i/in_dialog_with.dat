40|$|Abstract—Acquisition and {{representation}} of semantic concepts {{is a necessary}} requirement for the understanding of natural languages by cognitive systems. Word games provide an interesting opportunity for semantic knowledge acquisition {{that may be used}} to construct semantic memory. A task-dependent architecture of the knowledge base inspired by psycholinguistic theories of human cognition process is introduced. The core of the system is an algorithm for semantic search using a simplified vector representation of concepts. Based on this algorithm a 20 questions game has been implemented. This implementation provides an example of an application of the semantic memory, but also allows for testing the linguistic competence of the system. A web portal with Haptek-based talking head interface facilitates acquisition of a new knowledge while playing the game and engaging <b>in</b> <b>dialogs</b> <b>with</b> users. I...|$|R

We used six rule-based strategies to determine the placement of BCs. The BCs were performed by an intelligent virtual agent using nods and vocalizations. In a user perception experiment, participants were shown video fragments of a human speaker together with an artificial listener who produced BC behavior according to one of the strategies. Participants were asked to rate how likely they thought the BC behavior had been performed by a human listener. We found that the number, timing and type of BC had a significant effect on how human-like the BC behavior was perceived...|$|R

5000|$|Attributing {{meaning to}} {{something}} follows from sensing it, {{and is a}} prelude to action. [...] " [...] One always acts according {{to the meaning of}} whatever one faces [...] " [...] and the consequences of these actions in turn become part of the meanings of what one interacts with. Meanings are always someone's construction and depend on context and culture. The same artifact may invoke different meanings at different times, in different contexts of use, and for different people. To design artifacts for use by others calls on designers to understand the understanding of others, a second order understanding that is fundamentally unlike the understanding of physical things. Since meanings cannot be observed directly, designers need to carefully observe the actions that imply certain meanings; involve themselves <b>in</b> <b>dialog</b> <b>with</b> their stakeholders; and invite them to participate in the design process.|$|E
