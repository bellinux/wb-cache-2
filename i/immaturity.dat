40|$|AbstractSensitivity to {{orientation}} {{is critical for}} making a whole and complete picture of the world. We measured the orientation tuning of mechanisms in the visual cortex of typically developing 3 -month-olds and adults using a nonlinear analysis of the two-input steady-state Visually Evoked Potential (VEP). Two gratings, one a fixed test {{and the other a}} variable orientation masker were tagged with distinct temporal frequencies and the corresponding evoked responses were measured at the harmonics of the test and masker frequencies and at a frequency equal to the sum of the two stimulus frequencies. The magnitude of the sum frequency component depended strongly on the relative orientation of the test and masker in both infants and adults. The VEP tuning bandwidths of the 3 -month-olds measured at the sum frequency were similar to those of adults, suggesting that behavioral <b>immaturities</b> in functions such as orientation discrimination and contour integration may result from other <b>immaturities</b> in long-range lateral projections or feedback mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the properties of}} the foveal, parafoveal, and near peripheral cone lattice in human neonates. To estimate the ability of these lattices to transmit the information used in contrast sensitivity and visual acuity tasks, we constructed ideal-observer models with the optics and photoreceptors of the neonatal eye at retinal eccentricities of 0, 5, and 10 °. For ideal-observer models limited by photon noise, the eye's optics, and cone properties, contrast sensitivity was higher in the parafovea and near periphery than in the fovea. However, receptor pooling probably occurs in the neonate's parafovea and near periphery as it does in mature eyes. When we add a receptor-pooling stage to the models of the parafovea and near periphery, ideal acuity is similar in the fovea, parafovea, and near periphery. Comparisons of ideal and real sensitivity indicate that optical and receptoral <b>immaturities</b> impose a significant constraint on neonatal contrast sensitivity and acuity, but that <b>immaturities</b> in later processing stages must also limit visual performance...|$|R
40|$|Inhibitory control, {{the ability}} to inhibit {{impulsive}} responses in favor of voluntary responses, remains immature during adolescence. Although this behavior has been well documented, the cognitive and neural processes associated with immature inhibitory control during adolescence are still not well understood. To address this question, we collected Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 17 adolescents (age 14 - 16) and 20 adult participants (age 20 - 30), where participants performed the antisaccade (AS) and control prosaccade (PS) tasks. Leveraging MEG’s high temporal resolution, {{our goal was to}} delineate developmental changes in local neural oscillations and inter-regional neural synchronization associated with preparatory inhibitory control. Participants were shown a preparatory cue (a red “x” for AS or a green “x” for PS) for 1500 ms, followed by a peripheral target where participants were instructed to make a saccade toward (PS) or away (AS) from the target. Neural activity estimates from a priori brain regions were then extracted for oscillatory power and phase synchrony analyses. We found that compared to adults, adolescents showed decreased alpha-band power in the oculomotor regions in preparation to inhibit an upcoming reflexive saccade, suggesting <b>immaturities</b> in functional inhibition of task-inappropriate activity. Furthermore, adolescents showed weaker beta-band power in prefrontal cognitive control regions, which could reflect less robust top-down biasing of sensory and motor processes. Lastly, we found that adolescents showed decreased levels of phase synchrony between frontal and parietal regions, possibly reflecting <b>immaturities</b> in iv coordinating distributed cortical activities. Our results suggest that <b>immaturities</b> in functional inhibition, top-down control, and inter-regional synchrony collectively contribute to immature inhibitory control during adolescence...|$|R

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the <b>immaturity,</b> assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTAdolescent rats show <b>immaturities</b> in {{executive}} function {{and are less}} able than adult rats to learn reinforcement reversals and shift attentional set. These two forms of {{executive function}} rely on the functional integrity of the orbitofrontal and prelimbic cortices respectively. Drugs used to treat attention deficit disorder, such as atomoxetine, that increase cortical catecholamine levels improve executive functions in humans, non-human primates and adult rats with prefrontal lesions. Cortical noradrenergic systems {{are some of the}} last to mature in primates and rats. Moreover, norepinephrine transporters (NET) are higher in juvenile rats than adults. The underdeveloped cortical noradrenergic system and higher number of NET are hypothesized to underlie the <b>immaturities</b> in executive function found in adolescents. We assessed executive function in male Long-Evans rats using an intra-dimensional/extra-dimensional set shifting task. We administered the NET blocker, atomoxetine (0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 9 mg/kg/ml; i. p.), prior to the test of attentional set shift and a reinforcement reversal. The lowest dose of drug facilitated attentional set shifting but had no effect on reversal learning. These data demonstrate that NET blockade allows adolescent rats to more easily perform attentional set shifting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study we {{investigate}} the dependence of photopic contrast thresholds on retinal illuminance in infants and adults. Contrast thresholds were measured at five retinal illuminances between about 6 and about 20   000 Td in subjects in both age groups. The forced-choice preferential looking technique was used in 3 -month-old infants, and standard forced-choice techniques were used in adults. The stimulus was a 0. 25 cy/deg squarewave grating phase alternated at 6 Hz. Infants’ contrast thresholds were more than two log units {{higher than those of}} adults at all retinal illuminances. Contrast thresholds had a similar dependence on retinal illuminance in both infants and adults. For both age groups, contrast thresholds initially decreased with increasing retinal illuminance. However, at both ages, above a critical illuminance of about 200 Td, contrast thresholds remained constant, following Weber's law. Thus a vertical shift was sufficient to bring the two data sets into correspondence. In the context of a two-site model of light adaptation, our results imply that infants’ elevated contrast thresholds cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} photoreceptoral <b>immaturities.</b> Later physiological <b>immaturities</b> must also limit infants’ photopic contrast thresholds...|$|R

5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of <b>immaturity,</b> such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E

Historians have also discussed an exaggerated fear of communism as a factor, along with the lack of a stable center that could reach out to parties on the left and right; these parties accused each other of Bolshevism and fascism. According to historian Anatol Lieven, Smetona and Voldemaras saw themselves as the dispossessed true heroes of the independence movement, who despaired of returning to power by democratic means.|$|E

Below this frequency demarcation, phase steepens. Cochlear scaling and its breaking have been described in the adult cochlea but have not been studied in newborns. It is not clear whether <b>immaturities</b> in cochlear mechanics exist at birth in the human neonate. In this study, DPOAE phase was recorded with a swept-tone protocol in three, octave-wide segments from 0. 5 to 4 kHz. The lowest-frequency octave was targeted with increased signal averaging to enhance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and focus on the apical half of the newborn cochlea where breaks from scaling have been observed. The results show: (1) the ear canal DPOAE phase was dominated by the distortion-source component in the low frequencies; thus, the reflection component cannot explain the steeper slope of phase; (2) DPOAE phase-frequency functions from adults and infants showed an unambiguous discontinuity around 1. 4 and 1 kHz when described using two- and three-segment fits, respectively, and (3) newborns had a significantly steeper slope of phase in the low-frequency portion of the function which may suggest residual <b>immaturities</b> in the apical half of the newborn cochlea...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{investigators}} have related infants' low contrast sensitivity to <b>immaturities</b> in the optics and receptor lattice of the immature eye. A critical {{element in the}} modeling is how much the lower photon catch of the immature retina reduces sensitivity; the assumptions vary from square-root to Weber's law and lead to very different modeling outcomes. We measured the relationship between retinal illuminance and contrast sensitivity at different spatial frequencies. The sweep visual-evoked potential {{was used to measure}} thresholds in 2 - and 3 -month olds and adults over a 2. 5 -log-unit range of illuminances. The contrast threshold vs illuminance functions were fit by power functions. The best-fitting exponents for adults were about − 0. 5 at higher spatial frequencies (consistent with square-root law) and lower at lower frequencies. The best-fitting exponents for 2 - and 3 -month olds were − 0. 2 to − 0. 35 which indicates that threshold is less affected by changes in illuminance than is the case in adults. These results suggest that none of the models relating optical and receptoral <b>immaturities</b> to infants' spatial vision has assumed an appropriate relationship between lower photon catch and contrast sensitivity. Once the models are modified to incorporate the relationship obtained in the present experiment, the predictions fall well short of explaining 2 -month old's low contrast sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:: We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} RF center-surround organization of V 2 neurons is immature during early development (Zhang et al, PNAS, 2005). Because the receptive-field properties of V 2 neurons in neonates may be differentially influenced {{by the type of}} anesthetic/analgesic agents that are used for acute microelectrode experiments, we compared the response properties of V 1 and V 2 neurons at 2 - and 4 -weeks of age and at maturity in monkeys that were anesthetized with barbiturate or non-barbiturate agents. Methods:: Seven infant and 6 adult macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were prepared for microelectrode recording experiments. Anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of one of the following two anesthetic/analgesic agents: 1) Sodium Pentobarbital (Nembutal, 2 mg/kg/hr), or 2) a mixture of Propofol (4 mg/kg/hr) /Sufentanyl citrate (0. 05 µg/kg/hr). Results:: Regardless of which anesthesia was used, the average RF center size of V 1 and V 2 neurons in 2 -week-old infants was about 2 - 3 times as large as those in adults. The majority of V 2 units recorded in 2 -week-old infants lacked RF surrounds. Surround suppression in V 2 was weaker by a factor of 5 - 6 in 2 -week-old infants and by a factor of about 2 in 4 -week-old infants.

40|$|Introduction Relative to adults, human infants {{are born}} with limited perceptual, motor, linguistic, and {{cognitive}} abilities.

That is, they are <b>immaturities</b> or de ciencies which serve no positive purpose. A newer view is that these apparent inadequacies are in fact helpful, perhaps necessary, stages in development. According to this theory, limited mental abilities reect simple neural representations which are useful stones" or blocks" for the subsequent development of more complex representations (Turkewitz and Kenney, 1982).
