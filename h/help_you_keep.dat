Finding these passes is no easy task, as you must hunt out secret passages and traverse complex mazes to obtain them. So just like the previous title, it's an Easter Egg hunt.

There are fewer randomly hidden passages in this title, which allows him to enjoy exploring the stage more. The player will {{have plenty of time to}} enjoy the many diversions as he goes along his way, be it fighting off police and stray rabbits, buying video game cartridges, or trying to sneak into the woman's onsen. And to clear the difficulty of getting lost in towns, new signs have been added to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> track of where the player is going. Also, just about every stage also offers a store or two that will sell the player's passes in case he is burnt out from all the searching.|$|E

[...] He often drew on the disparate ways customers around the world perceived product benefits. For example, as diet soda brands grew popular in the 80s, he explained:"In the American market, if you say a diet drink is to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> in shape, it’s like saying a car has four wheels.
