40|$|Most herbivorous {{arthropods}} are <b>host</b> {{specialists and}} the question is which mechanisms drive the evolution of such specialization. The theory of antagonistic pleiotropy suggests that there is a trade-off between adaptation of herbivores to a novel <b>host</b> and their native <b>host.</b> The mutation accumulation hypothesis proposes that herbivores on a novel <b>host</b> lose their adaptation to the native <b>host</b> through the accumulation of mutations with negligible effects on performance on the novel <b>host.</b> Experimental evidence for either of the two hypotheses is scarce. We compared the fitness of two sympatric moth strains from an introduced <b>host</b> and a native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> did not perform better on this <b>host</b> than the strain from the native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> performed less well on the native <b>host</b> than did the strain from the native <b>host.</b> Hence, selection on the novel <b>host</b> did not result in noticeable gain in performance, but adaptation to the native <b>host</b> was lost.

40|$|Obligate avian brood parasites show {{dramatic}} {{variation in}} {{the degree to which}} they are <b>host</b> specialists or <b>host</b> generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single <b>host,</b> the bay-winged cowbird (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing <b>host</b> specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as <b>hosts</b> evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, <b>host</b> specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable <b>hosts</b> that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of <b>host</b> defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in alternative <b>hosts</b> is lower than that in the main <b>host.</b> We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as alternative <b>hosts</b> two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus). We assessed <b>host</b> defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and alternative <b>hosts.</b> Alternative <b>hosts</b> did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and alternative <b>hosts,</b> but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in alternative <b>hosts.</b> Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel <b>hosts,</b> but higher reproductive success in the current <b>host</b> may favour <b>host</b> fidelity...|$|R

40|$|Phytophagous (plant-feeding) {{insects are}} {{extremely}} species-rich and typically display tight <b>host</b> associations (meeting and mating {{on or near}} their <b>host</b> plant) with one or {{a small number of}} <b>hosts.</b> This specialized lifestyle can promote diversification through assortative mating, ultimately leading to genetically differentiated <b>host</b> races (<b>host</b> associated differentiation; HAD). It has been shown that HAD can cascade up to the parasitic wasps (parasitoids) that utilize the phytophagous insects as <b>hosts.</b> Cascading HAD occurs when there is genetic differentiation among parasitoids as a result of differential <b>host</b> plant use by their <b>host</b> insects. Thus, <b>host</b> switching can promote parasitoid diversification as well. Here, I present three studies designed to help understand aspects of parasitoid shifts to novel <b>hosts</b> and environments. All of the studies in this dissertation utilize the Rhagoletis complex of flies and their associated parasitoids. Specifically, I address i) the role of subtle trait variation and environmental context in predicting successful parasitoid <b>host</b> shifts; ii) whether parasitoid <b>host</b> discrimination (a trait that can influence <b>host</b> shifts) is an innate or learned behavior; and iii) whether contemporary patterns of <b>host</b> shifts among parasitoids are echoed by historical <b>host</b> shifts in cophylogenetic analyses of <b>host</b> and parasitoid genera? Towards my first aim, I present a phenomenological model developed to predict successful <b>host</b> shifts by parasitoids. The simulations of the model explore how environmentally mediated traits can affect successful parasitoid colonization of a new <b>host.</b> For my second aim, I hypothesize that behaviors impacting parasitoid <b>host</b> plant preferences <b>host</b> shifts will be genetically based rather than a learned behavior. Shifting to a new <b>host</b> plant has been shown to cause reproductive isolation in phytophagous insects because of strong fidelity with their <b>host</b> plant. Parasitoids, however, have no direct contact with the <b>host</b> plant as they develop entirely within the <b>host</b> insect. The differences in life history traits could result parasitoid <b>host</b> shifts being driven by random changes in <b>host</b> preferences. I present preliminary results suggesting that parasitoids preferentially respond to their ancestral <b>host</b> plant’s olfactory cues, suggesting that <b>host</b> preferences have a genetic basis. Finally, I present a cophylogenetic analysis of Rhagoletis <b>hosts</b> and their parasitoids. I find that cospeciation is the most common coevolutionary event, although there is evidence of recent <b>host</b> shifting that contributes to current parasitoid species diversity. The results of these studies can help us understand how <b>host</b> shifts can act as a potential mechanism driving diversification in parasitoids...|$|R
