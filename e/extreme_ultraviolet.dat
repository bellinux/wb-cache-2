In 1975, the first extra-solar source of <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet,</b> the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices.

5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{radiation}} emitted by white dwarfs varies {{over a wide}} color range, from the blue-white color of an O-type main sequence star to the red of an M-type red dwarf. White dwarf effective surface temperatures extend from over 150,000K to barely under 4,000K. In accordance with the Stefan–Boltzmann law, luminosity increases with increasing surface temperature; this surface temperature range corresponds to a luminosity from over 100 times the Sun's to under 1/10,000 that of the Sun's. Hot white dwarfs, with surface temperatures in excess of 30,000K, have been observed to be sources of soft (i.e., lower-energy) X-rays. This enables the composition and structure of their atmospheres to be studied by soft X-ray and <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> observations.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of solar <b>extreme</b> and far <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) irradiance variations {{is essential for}} the characterization of the Earth’s upper atmosphere. For a long time, this knowledge has been based on empirical models, which are themselves based on proxies of the solar activity. However, the accurate modeling and prediction of the Earth’s upper atmosphere necessitate to improve the precision on the irradiance and its variations below about 200 nm. Here, we present a review of recent works made by the authors that aim at quantifying the irradiance variability at these wavelengths, and that lead to new way of monitoring the solar EUV/FUV irradiance spectrum. In more details, it is shown that the quantification of the high level of redundancy in the solar spectrum variability allows to envisage measuring {{only a small portion of}} the spectrum without losing essential knowledge. Finally, we discuss what should and could be measured in order to retrieve the solar <b>extreme</b> and far <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrum...|$|R

25|$|Reducing defects on <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) masks is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or be on top of the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} nanoflares might heat the corona was {{proposed}} by Eugene Parker in the 1980s {{but is still}} controversial. In particular, ultraviolet telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> light, but {{there seem to be}} too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the TRACE data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} wave heating {{has been the}} {{complete}} absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the <b>extreme</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) {{for long periods of}} time with stable photometry. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 millihertz (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.|$|E
40|$|We study atomic autoionization {{processes}} in the time domain. With the emerging attosecond <b>extreme</b> vacuum <b>ultraviolet</b> and soft x-ray pulses, we first address how to characterize the time evolution of the decay of a discrete state into a degenerate continuum. A short pump beam generates a number of resonance states in a series and the nearby background continuum, and the resultant wave packet evolves with time until the full decay of the bound states. Taking the 2 pns(^ 1 P^o) resonance series embedded in the 2 sEp(^ 1 P^o) continuum in beryllium atom as an example, the time evolution of the autoionizing wave packet in energy domain and in coordinate space is calculated and analyzed, where Fano profiles build up in the photoelectron energy during the process. A proposed pump-probe scheme assumes that the probe beam ionizes the 2 s inner electron in the wave packet. The lifetimes of the resonances and the photoelectron energy distribution {{can be obtained from}} the ionization yield versus the time delay of the probe. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|Occupational skin {{diseases}} such as contact dermatitis, skin cancers, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly. Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups.

Physical agents such as <b>extreme</b> temperatures and <b>ultraviolet</b> or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure. Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions. Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.|$|R
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{nitrogen}} fixation process by photochemistry in the Titan atmosphere are not fully understood. The recent Cassini mission revealed organic aerosol formation in the upper atmosphere of Titan. It is not clear, however, how much and by what mechanism nitrogen is incorporated in Titan’s organic aerosols. Using tunable synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Light Source, we demonstrate the first evidence of nitrogenated organic aerosol production by <b>extreme</b> ultraviolet–vacuum <b>ultraviolet</b> irradiation of a N 2 /CH 4 gas mixture. The ultrahigh-mass-resolution study with laser desorption ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry of N 2 /CH 4 photolytic solid products at 60 and 82. 5  nm indicates the predominance of highly nitrogenated compounds. The distinct nitrogen incorporations at the elemental abundances of H 2 C 2 N and HCN, respectively, are suggestive of important roles of H 2 C 2 N/HCCN and HCN/CN in their formation. The efficient formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is observed in the gas phase without abundant nitrogenated neutrals at 60  nm, and this is confirmed by separately using 13 C and 15 N isotopically labeled initial gas mixtures. These observations strongly suggest a heterogeneous incorporation mechanism via short lived nitrogenated reactive species, such as HCCN radical, for nitrogenated organic aerosol formation, and imply that substantial amounts of nitrogen is fixed as organic macromolecular aerosols in Titan’s atmosphere...|$|R
