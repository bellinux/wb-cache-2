I am helping her gild fir-cones for a Christmas-tree for the quire, and they will sing carols. Macrae brought some for us the day before yesterday, and a famous lot of holly and ivy and {{mistletoe}} and flowers, and three turkeys and some hams and pheasants and partridges. Aunt Jane sent the biggest turkey and ham in a basket covered up with holly to Mrs. White, and another to Mrs. Hablot, and they are doing the church with the holly and ivy. We are to eat the other the day after to-morrow, and Mr. Grant and Miss Burne, who teaches the youngest form, are coming. It was only cold beef to-day, to let Mrs. Mount go to church; but we had mince pies, and I am going to Kitty's Christmas party to-morrow, and we shall dance---so Aunt Ada {{has given me a}} new white frock and a lovely Roman sash of her own. Poor old Mrs. Vincent is dead, and Fergus's great black rabbit, and poor little Mary Brown with dip---(blot). I can't spell it, and nobody <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me how, but the thing in people's throats, and poor Anne has got it, and Dr. Ellis says it was a mercy we were all away from home, for we should have had it too, {{and that would have been}} ever so much worse than the whooping-cough.|$|E
50|$|The narrator starts {{telling the}} story of a {{goldfish}} but… he suddenly realizes that he is mistaken. He <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Emilie Jolie’s story! While her parents are out, the young Emilie lying alone in her bed is frightened by the darkness. She finds a picture book on the floor and, she immerses herself in it with the voice of the narrator. The first song called “song of the young girl in the empty bedroom” is displayed.|$|E

When people stand inside, they speak in whispers. It is a sacred place. I believe it <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story - the story of the {{internal}} slave trade to future generations." [...] Visitors to the museum can walk through the holding pen and touch its walls. The first names of some of the slaves believed to have been held in the pen are listed on a wooden slab in the pen's interior; they were documented in records kept by slave traders who used the pen.|$|E

40|$|Wilcox County Confederate Monument - Abbeville, GA This {{monument}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} Wilcox County Library directly {{across the street from the}} Wilcox County Courthouse. It is a prominent feature in such a small community and eye-catching to anyone passing through town. A top a tall square shaft a Civil war soldier stands wearing a Confederate uniform and hat. The shaft rests on a three tiered base. This monument was fabricated by McNeel Marble Works, and dedicated on April 26, 1909. It was erected by the Abbeville Chapter, United daughters of the Confederacy. The text on the left side reads as : 2 ̆ 2 This craven stone <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> to all the world the love we bear to those who fought and bled and fell whose battle cry was do and dare.

6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, Don Pedro, that if {{you will}} hold your hand for three days, I will {{undertake}} to raise the ransom you demand, which Don Miguel de Espinosa refuses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Nita, {{clasping}} {{her hands}} with a force peculiar to her demonstrative nature, [...] "how wonderful! How I do wish the Professor <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us how and what it be." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am not here," [...] {{continued}} Andre-Louis, [...] "merely {{to demand}} at your hands vengeance upon Philippe de Vilmorin's murderers. I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{the things he}} would to-day have told you had he lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a brave fellow," [...] {{he said to}} Cuitcatl, who had {{accompanied}} them, [...] "and fought manfully and well. Had he not guarded my back during the fight, I should not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale, now." ...|$|R
60|$|Morton (slowly and seriously). He {{has left}} me <b>here</b> <b>to</b> answer the {{unanswered}} question you asked him. (Enter Don Jose and Col. STARBOTTLE, R. and L.) I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I am his father, {{and that he}} is Alexander Morton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] he remarked, [...] "you {{have had}} a pretty narrow escape. If we had not got in when we did, you would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale. I don't know that I ever saw any one much nearer to the undertaker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasant enough, sir, on the whole; {{but we were}} {{attacked}} by the Malay pirates, and I should certainly not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale, at present, {{had it not been}} for the quickness and shrewdness of a lad, who had been shipwrecked on the coast." ...|$|R

6000|$|She was {{somewhat}} reassured, and presently went on--'I don't wonder they are vexed. I {{know how much}} beneath him I am, but I could not help that. Oh!

6000|$|... "Judge," [...] he said slowly, with {{an attempt}} to control his voice, [...] "wouldn't it have been fairer to wait awhile, before you made a remark like that?

6000|$|... 'Heaven {{bless you}} for your goodness!' rejoined the girl. 'If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed.

5000|$|In 2012, National Journal named Love one of ten Republicans {{to follow}} on Twitter.

60|$|Now, {{all these}} {{conditions}} {{of which you}} complain should be remedied, and I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you just how to do it. I've been a statesman without salary for many years, and I have accomplished great and widespread good. I don't know that it has benefited anybody very much, {{even if it was}} good; but I do know that it hasn't harmed me very much, and is hasn't made me any richer.|$|R
5000|$|Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly also {{commented on}} the {{relation}} between the opening scene and the episode's overall concept of truth: [...] "The truth is pliable, and it can be swayed by those with power. Making the assertion that something is fact when there is no one powerful enough to hold you accountable — ahem! — can transform the statement into a version of the truth. 'We <b>are</b> not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories,' the Stasi officer says. 'We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth.' The show itself performs its own tongue-in-cheek take on this idea each week by stating that following is true when the audience has no way to refute it." [...] He also noted that the science fiction-related elements in Ennis Stussy's house (a film on television and the books Gloria finds) are reminiscent of the occasional science fiction elements in season 2.|$|R
6000|$|Selecting a rosebud, {{from some}} flowers in her hand, she {{handed it to}} him. [...] "That is my first rosebud this year," [...] she said; [...] "it is for you because you are {{painting}} me. To-day I am thirteen, Herr Harz; there {{is not to be}} a sitting, because it is my birthday; but, instead, we are all going to Meran to see the play of Andreas Hofer. You are to come too, please; I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, and the others shall <b>be</b> <b>here</b> directly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bob Grant as Jack Harper, Stan's conductor, {{best friend}} and next-door neighbour. He and Stan are always getting into trouble and getting reprimanded by Inspector Blake. Whether it is {{tampering}} with radio controls, putting [...] "DIVERSION" [...] road signs in the wrong places or going on dates with the buxom clippies, they are always getting into scrapes. Jack is also the shop steward of the bus depot, and frequently abuses his position to thwart Blakey's schemes, usually with the catchphrase [...] "As shop steward I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you.....".|$|R
5000|$|He {{returned}} to Broadway on September 19, 2006, {{in the role}} of Gaston in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. He was scheduled to perform for nine weeks, but due to popular demand he extended his run through December 24. Liz Smith of the New York Post wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you he <b>is</b> charmingly campy, good-looking and grand as the villain 'Gaston', patterned after our old friend Elvis", and noting [...] "Donny is divine". On July 29, 2007, Osmond played Gaston again for the final performance of Beauty and the Beast.|$|R
5000|$|The joke, which spread far {{and wide}} and was {{repeated}} everywhere, was said to end with an assertion that this line had caused his detention — and would cause his later self-exile from Cuba in the same year. However, this story was later denied in Miami by Fernández, who, on hearing it from an alleged theater hand present at that performance, corrected the storyteller with visible displeasure and said: [...] "Gentlemen, had I done and said those things, I would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the story… [...] ".|$|R
5000|$|Todd Mowatt of Electric Playground wrote, [...] "Like a flame broiled Whopper at Burger King, {{this game}} is being loaded with features, {{including}} an original storyline. Gamers aren't strangers to prehistoric reptiles and the previous Jurassic Park games were anything but stellar--the words 'dinosaur dung' come to mind--so Savage and Universal have their {{work cut out for}} them. ... I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that there is hope.

5000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{a little}} bit about what a Cajun is. A Cajun is a person who his {{homeland}} was France. Went into Nova Scotia, at the time Acadia, and settled there and was there for about a hundred years, and afterwards the British took over the territory and then the French-speaking people, the French descendants, known as the Acadians, came down to the South-Western part of Louisiana, and that was back in 1755. So over all of these years, your language, and your music has been preserved from daddy to son or daddy to daughter or momma to daughter." ...|$|R
