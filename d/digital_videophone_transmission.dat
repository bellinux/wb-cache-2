40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} system for improving <b>videophone</b> <b>transmission</b> over EDCA. We {{consider that a}} videophone contains a constant bit rate (CBR) voice source and a rate-adaptive video source. Two issues are addressed in this research. Firstly, how to solve the AP bottleneck problem, and secondly, how to adjust video source rate to improve the network performance. For the first issue, we propose the adjustment of the transmission opportunity (TXOP) to give AP a higher priority in voice transmission in order to eliminate the AC 3 transmission bottleneck at the AP. For the second issue, our principle is to guarantee the throughput of voice traffic while transmitting as much video traffic as possible. Moreover, we consider more realistic multi-rate WLANs, where multiple transmission rates {{are used in the}} PHY layer depending on the underlaying channel conditions. I...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{communication}} channels {{are subject to}} multipath fading, which in turn results in burst errors occurring in the transmitted bit stream. When the data is source coded video data, such errors will cause a rapid deterioration of the decoded image sequence. This paper presents a method for reducing the effects of such errors on the H. 263 coded bit stream using Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional (RCPC) codes for Unequal Error Protection (UEP) and describes some modifications made to the source decoder for error concealment. Numerical results are obtained for RCPC codes over Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels and they are compared with a sequence coded using a burst error correcting block code RS(15, 11) and one without any form of channel coding. Keywords: H. 263, unequal error protection, video coding, Rayleigh fading, burst errors 1.

40|$|Video {{compression}} is {{the process}} of reducing the amount of data required to represent digital video while preserving an acceptable video quality. Recent studies on video compression have focused on multimedia <b>transmission,</b> <b>videophones,</b> teleconferencing, high definition television (HDTV), CD-ROM storage, etc. The idea of compression techniques is to remove the redundant information that exists in the video sequences. Motion compensated predictive coding is the main coding tool for removing temporal redundancy of video sequences and it typically accounts for 50 - 80...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{prospect}} of using a Binary Discrete Cosine Transform as an integral component of an image compression system. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) algorithm is well known and commonly used for image compression. Various compression techniques are actively being researched as they are attractive for many industrial applications. The particular compression technique focused on was still image compression using the DCT. The recent expansion of image compression algorithms and multimedia based mobile, including many wireless communication applications, handheld devices, <b>digital</b> cameras, <b>videophones,</b> and PDAs has furthered {{the need for more}} efficient ways to compress both digital signals and images. The objective of this research to find a generic model to be used for image compression was met. This software model uses the BinDCT algorithm and also develops a detection system that is accurate and efficient for implementation in hardware, particularly to ru...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of more processing demanding applications on the Internet (video broadcasting) {{on one hand and}} the popularity of recent devices at the user level (<b>digital</b> cameras, wireless <b>videophones,</b> [...] .) on the other hand introduce challenges at several levels. Today, such devices present processing capabilities and bandwidth settings that are inefficient to manage scalable QoS requirements in a typical media delivery framework. In this paper, we present an impact study of such a scalable data representation optimized for QoS (Matching Pursuit 3 D algorithms) on processor architectures to achieve the best performance and power efficiency. A review of state of the art techniques for processor architecture enhancement let us expect promising opportunities from the latest developments in the reconfigurable computing research field. We present here the first design steps of an efficient reconfigurable coprocessor especially designed to cope with future video delivery and multimedia processing requirements. Architecture perspectives are proposed with respect to low development cost constraints, backward compatibilty and easy coprocessor usage using an original strategy based on a hardware/software codesign methodology...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the BinDCT algorithm, a fast {{approximation}} of the Discrete Cosine Transform, and its efficient VLSI architectures for hardware implementations. The design {{objective is to}} meet the real-time constrain in embedded systems. Two VLSI architectures are proposed. The first architecture is targeted for low complexity applications such as <b>videophones,</b> <b>digital</b> cameras, and digital camcorders. The second architecture is designed for high perform applications, which include high definition TV and digital cinema. In {{order to meet the}} real-time constrain for these applications, we decompose the structure of the BinDCT algorithm into simple matrices and map them into multi-stage pipeline architectures. For low complexity implementation, the proposed 2 -D BinDCT architecture can be realized with the cost of 10 integer adders, 80 registers and 384 bytes of embedded memory. The high performance architecture can be implemented with an extra of 30 adders. These designs can calculate realtime DCT/IDCT for video applications of CIF format at 5 MHz clock rate with 1. 55 volt power supply. With its high performance and low power consumption features, BinDCT coprocessor is an excellent candidate for real-time DCT-based image and video processing applications...|$|R
40|$|Image {{compression}} {{is widely}} used in today's consumer applications such as digital camcorders, <b>digital</b> cameras, <b>videophones</b> and high-definition television (HDTV). As Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is dominant in many international standards for image/video and audio compression, the introduction of multiplierless algorithm for fast DCT computation known as BinDCT (Binary DCT) is very well suited for VLSI implementation. Its performances in term of Peak Signal-to-Noise (PSNR), compression ratio and coding gain is proved to be best approximation to the DCT algorithm. In this work, the design and implementation of 8 x 8 block 2 -D forward BinDCT algorithm on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is presented. As this algorithm uses simple arithmetic operations (shift and add) rather than floating-point multiplications, low power hardware implementation is very promising. The aim for low power implementation was achieved at architectural level by employing 4 stages pipeline architecture with parallel processing in each stage. However, due to the tradeoff between hardware area and speed, this design is focusing on optimising hardware area in each stage such that it can fit the target FPGA device. The 8 x 8 block two-dimensional (2 -D) forward BinDCT implementation can be run at 68. 58 MHz with the power consumption of 144. 10 mW. This implementation achieved 12. 45 % less power compare {{with the implementation of}} BinDCT presented previously if the design runs at the same speed. Furthermore, results have shown that this implementation achieved good accuracy compare with software implementation as the maximum error of the output from 2 -D computation is 1. 26 %. Several works can be done for further power optimisation such as data gating and latency balancing at each stage (which can improves the throughput as well). Besides,the implementation of 8 x 8 block 2 -D inverse BinDCT should be carried out such that its accuracy over floating-point DCT in terms of hardware implementation can be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the demand}} for digital video {{products}} has witnessed a boom. Some examples of popular applications are video communication, security and surveillance, industrial automation, and the biggest of all, entertainment, which includes DVD, highdefintion (HD) TV, satellite TV, HD set-top boxes, Internet video streaming, digital cameras and HD video camcorders, video jukeboxes, high end displays (LCD, Plasma and DLP) and personal video recorders. A slew of new and exciting applications are currently in design or early deployment. For example, HD-DVD (Blu-ray), digital video broadcast, both to {{the home and the}} handset through terrestrial or satellite (DVB-T, DVB-H, DMB), HD <b>videophones,</b> <b>digital</b> cinema and IP Set-top boxes. End products are also increasingly becoming mobile and converged as a result of higher computational power in handsets, advances in battery technology and high-speed wireless connectivity. Video compression is an essential enabler for all these exciting new video products. Compression-decompression (codec) algorithms make it possible to store and transmit digital video. Typically, codecs are either industry standards such as MPEG- 2, MPEG- 4, H. 264 /AVC and AVS or proprietary algorithms, such as On 2, Real Video, Nancy and Windows Media Video (WMV). WMV is an exception as it was originally a Microsoft proprietary algorithm that is now also standardized by SMPTE as VC- 1. Codec technology has continuously improved in the last decade. The most recent codecs, H. 264 /AVC and VC- 1, represent the third generation of video compression technology. Both codecs are capable of squeezing very high compression ratios utilizing the available processing horsepower in low-cost ICs suc...|$|R
40|$|Three {{telemedicine}} applications which {{depend on}} relatively simple telephone technology to transfer {{data in the}} care of patients managing chronic conditions at home are investigated in order to evaluate their application from the users’ perspectives. Part one provides an evaluation of four mobile cameraphones, of varying quality, such as those commonly used to photograph patients for remote diagnosis. The cameraphones are compared with a <b>digital</b> camera, two <b>videophones</b> and an ISDN 6 conferencing facility, in their ability to replicate colour and shape. The effects of uploading the images to a laptop computer and of transferring an image by MSN messaging are also evaluated. Part two provides an evaluation of electronic weighing scales connected via a wireless gateway to a landline telephone for the purpose of remote weight monitoring in patients with chronic heart failure. Self-reported experiences of patients, carers and specialist nurses are explored and outcomes compared with previously published opinion. The idiosyncratic nature of health care is highlighted as a main factor in {{the success or failure of}} the system. The third application is a patient-operated 12 -lead ECG unit which transmits data via a home landline to a call centre, where it is displayed as an ECG trace and a report is given by specialist clinicians. Self-reported experiences of patients with arrhythmia reveal systematic phenomena which hinder the effectiveness of the device and which are related to human, not technological, failings. ECG traces obtained by unskilled lay persons on paediatric patients are compared with the ECG traces obtained by skilled and experienced paediatric nurses on the same patients. The results show that in the case of the cameraphones the technology is less accurate than normally assumed. In the case of the weight monitoring and ECG equipment however it is more usually human factors which cause a disappointing outcome...|$|R
40|$|Aim: A {{systematic}} literature review, covering publications from 1994 to 2009, {{was carried}} out {{to determine the effects}} of teleconsultation regarding clinical, behavioral, and care coordination outcomes of diabetes care compared to usual care. Two types of teleconsultation were distinguished: (1) asynchronous teleconsultation for monitoring and delivering feedback via email and cell phone, automated messaging systems, or other equipment without face-to-face contact; and (2) synchronous teleconsultation that involves real-time, face-to-face contact (image and voice) via videoconferencing equipment (television, <b>digital</b> camera, webcam, <b>videophone,</b> etc.) to connect caregivers and one or more patients simultaneously, e. g., for the purpose of education. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant publications about asynchronous and synchronous teleconsultation [Medline, Picarta, Psychinfo, ScienceDirect, Telemedicine Information Exchange, Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, Google Scholar]. Reference lists of identified publications were hand searched. The contribution to diabetes care was examined for clinical outcomes [e. g., hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), dietary values, blood pressure, quality of life], for behavioral outcomes (patient-caregiver interaction, self-care), and for care coordination outcomes (usability of technology, cost-effectiveness, transparency of guidelines, equity of access to care). Randomized controlled trials with HbA 1 c as an outcome were pooled using standard metaanalytical methods. Results: Of 2060 publications identified, 90 met inclusion criteria for electronic communication between (groups of) caregivers and patients with type 1 and 2 or gestational diabetes. Studies that evaluated teleconsultation not particularly aimed at diabetes were excluded, as were those that described interventions aimed solely at clinical improvements (e. g., HbA 1 c or lipid profiles). In 63 of 90 interventions, the interaction had an asynchronous teleconsultation character, in 18 cases interaction was synchronously (videoconferencing), and 9 involved a combination of synchronous with asynchronous interaction. Most of the reported improvements concerned clinical values (n = 49), self-care (n = 46), and satisfaction with technology (n = 43). A minority of studies demonstrated improvements in patient-caregiver interactions (n = 28) and cost reductions (n = 27). Only a few studies reported enhanced quality of life (n = 12), transparency of health care (n = 7), and improved equity in care delivery (n = 4). Asynchronous and synchronous applications appeared to differ in the type of contribution they made to diabetes care compared to usual care: asynchronous applications were more successful in improving clinical values and self-care, whereas synchronous applications led to relatively high usability of technology and cost reduction in terms of lower travel costs for both patients and care providers and reduced unscheduled visits compared to usual care. The combined applications (n = 9) scored best according to quality of life (22. 2 %). No differences between synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultation could be observed regarding the positive effect of technology on the quality of patient-provider interaction. Both types of applications resulted in intensified contact and increased frequency of transmission of clinical values with respect to usual care. Fifteen of the studies contained HbA 1 c data that permitted pooling. There was significant statistical heterogeneity among the pooled randomized controlled trials (χ 2 = 96. 46, P < 0. 001). The pooled reduction in HbA 1 c was not statically significant (weighted mean difference - 0. 10; 95 % confidence interval - 0. 39 to 0. 18). Conclusion: The included studies suggest that both synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultations for diabetes care are feasible, cost-effective, and reliable. However, it should be noted that many of the included studies showed no significant differences between control (usual care) and intervention groups. This might be due to the diversity and lack of quality in study designs (e. g., inaccurate or incompletely reported sample size calculations). Future research needs quasi-experimental study designs and a holistic approach that focuses on multilevel determinants (clinical, behavioral, and care coordination) to promote self-care and proactive collaborations between health care professionals and patients to manage diabetes care. Also, a participatory design approach is needed in which target users are involved in the development of cost-effective and personalized interventions. Currently, too often technology is developed within the scope of the existing structures of the health care system. Including patients as part of the design team stimulates and enables designers to think differently, unconventionally, or from a new perspective, leading to applications that are better tailored to patients' needs...|$|R
