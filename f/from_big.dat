He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E

The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.|$|E

5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference <b>from</b> <b>Big</b> Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena <b>from</b> <b>Big</b> Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at Hell in a Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 13,000 Royal Military Police (“redcaps”). They were unpopular, {{at a time}} when the police were often unpopular with young men <b>from</b> <b>big</b> cities. Besides policing, a large part of their job was {{maintaining}} discipline on the march and keeping roads running smoothly, and collecting stragglers from a battle. During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military Police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by Military Police, no reliable first-hand accounts exist of this happening.|$|E

5|$|In early 2004, Cena {{participated in}} the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, {{making it to the}} final six before being {{eliminated}} by Big Show. Chris Benoit was the eventual winner of the match. The Royal Rumble elimination led to a feud with Big Show. At No Way Out, Cena faced Big Show and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to earn a WWE Championship match, with Angle beating Cena by submission. Cena won his first singles championship in WWE, the United States Championship <b>from</b> <b>Big</b> Show at WrestleMania XX after delivering an F-U for the pinfall victory. The reign ended almost four months after successful title defences against the likes of Rene Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T, when he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of SmackDown! by Angle after he accidentally knocked him over, thus attacking an official. Cena won the championship back defeating Booker T in a best of five series that culminated at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean Cool the following week on SmackDown!. After the loss to Carlito, the duo began a feud, which resulted in Cena allegedly being stabbed in the kidney while at a Boston-area nightclub by Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús. This worked injury was used to keep Cena out of action for a month while Cena was filming The Marine. Immediately on his return in November, Cena won the United States Championship back from Carlito. Cena later successfully defended the championship against Jesus at Armageddon in a street fight match.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{made his}} debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892. The club played in The Combination, a league which {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} town clubs and reserve teams of clubs <b>from</b> <b>big</b> cities. At {{the end of his}} first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2–1 to Wrexham. Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right William Owen, a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike. In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses. Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from the Football League {{at the end of the}} 1893–94 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win. Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup.|$|E
