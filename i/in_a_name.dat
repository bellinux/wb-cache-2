5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E

After many other stage appearances, some with the Provincetown Players, she and her partner, the photographer Francis Bruguière, moved to London in 1927.

Hurwitz sold the Starry Night in February 1991, claiming he had [...] "lost {{the support of the}} local music industry".

500|$|The boy was curious, {{he was a}} big Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking the name of the film.

A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday!

500|$|Another {{aspect of}} naming was the {{importance}} {{attached to the}} wider meaning contained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>name.</b> In 17th-century England {{it was believed that}} choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names. In 1652 William Jenkyn, an English clergyman, argued that first names should be [...] "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master". In 1623, at a time when Puritan names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian William Camden wrote that names should be chosen with [...] "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions. With the rise of the British Empire the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.|$|E
500|$|Gender studies {{critics have}} argued that Rosaline's name {{suggests}} that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. [...] Thus, when Juliet cries [...] "What's <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>name?</b> A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," [...] she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view {{of her as a}} substitute for Rosaline. [...] That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo. Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society. [...] Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. [...] As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. [...] Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. [...] Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as [...] "beauties Rose." [...] This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's [...] "What's in a name?" [...] soliloquy. [...] When Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.|$|E
