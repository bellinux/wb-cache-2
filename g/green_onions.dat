5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, <b>green</b> <b>onions,</b> ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E

40|$|The radical {{scavenging}} activity (RAS), chain-breaking activity, H 2 O 2 -scavenging, reducing {{capacity and}} total phenolics of {{four types of}} <b>onions</b> (<b>Green</b> <b>onion,</b> Yellow, Red and Purple) and garlic were investigated. Total phenolics varied from 30 mg (<b>green</b> <b>onion)</b> to 49 mg. 100 g- 1 fresh weight (garlic). Garlic extract showed the highest RAS, while <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> showed the lowest one. The chain-breaking activity of <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract was higher (0. 48) than garlic extract (0. 029). Chain-breaking activity of yellow, red and purple onion extracts was 0. 19, 0. 048 and 0. 032 respectively. However, heating treatment (90 ºC, 3 h) caused an increase in this activity. Low ability of <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract to scavenge hydrogen peroxide was noted (35 %), whereas high ability was noted in other onion and garlic extracts and ranged from 60 to 90 %. The lowest reducing capacity was noted in <b>green</b> <b>onion</b> extract (18 %), whereas the highest in garlic extract (196 %).

25|$|Many new foods were {{introduced}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries, following Western contacts and settlements. The cassava plant was one such introduction; it is called manioke in Tongan. While it lacks {{the prestige of the}} yam, it is an easy plant to grow and a common crop. Introduced watermelons became popular. They were eaten either by themselves, or pulped and mixed with coconut milk, forming a popular drink called 'otai. Other fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes, became popular. Tongans also adopted onions, <b>green</b> <b>onions,</b> cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, and other common vegetables. In the last few decades, Tongan farmers with access to large tracts of land have engaged in commercial farming of pumpkins and other easily shipped vegetables as cash crops.|$|E
500|$|Gumbo {{is usually}} {{identified}} by its dark roux, cooked {{until it is}} a color [...] "a few shades from burning". The roux is used with okra or filé powder. [...] Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. [...] The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. [...] Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and <b>green</b> <b>onions.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot {{until the end of the}} process. [...] As the gumbo finishes cooking, <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{outbreak}} of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred {{among people who}} ate at a now defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak {{was brought to the}} attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in [...] cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the <b>green</b> <b>onions</b> may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected individuals. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.|$|E

60|$|When {{she came}} back, Ramona in a {{pleasant}} lather, Saxon rode {{to the rear}} of the house, past the chicken houses and the flourishing berry-rows, to join Billy on the rim of the bench, where he sat on his horse in the shade, smoking a cigarette. Together they looked down through an opening among the trees to the meadow which was a meadow no longer. With mathematical accuracy it was divided into squares, oblongs, and narrow strips, which displayed sharply the thousand hues of green of a truck garden. Gow Yum and Chan Chi, under enormous Chinese grass hats, were planting <b>green</b> <b>onions.</b> Old Hughie, hoe in hand, plodded along the main artery of running water, opening certain laterals, closing others. From the work-shed beyond the barn the strokes of a hammer told Saxon that Carlsen was wire-binding vegetable boxes. Mrs. Paul's cheery soprano, lifted in a hymn, doated through the trees, accompanied by the whirr of an egg-beater. A sharp barking told where Possum still waged hysterical and baffled war on the Douglass squirrels. Billy took a long draw from his cigarette, exhaled the smoke, and continued to look down at the meadow. Saxon divined trouble in his manner. His rein-hand was on the pommel, and her free hand went out and softly rested on his. Billy turned his slow gaze upon her mare's lather, seeming not to note it, and continued on to Saxon's face.|$|E
