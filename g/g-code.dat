The language is {{a modified version of the}} conventional <b>G-codes</b> with added features. The {{machining center}} has the facility to use either the <b>G-codes</b> or the modified language. The modified language also has the facility of using functional parameters within a program by substituting them with variables which are either entered at a later stage or calculated by the controller. When executing the program, the control then uses the numerical values generated. ^ The functions that can be used are Assign, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square Root, Sine, Cosine, Root Sum of Squares, If Equal, If Unequal, If Greater Than and If Less Than. This work involves making use of these functional parameters to program complex curves. By defining the part geometry with the help of equations and mathematical definitions other functions such as Exponential, Logarithmic to any Base and Hyperbolic functions can be machined. ^ The use of the mathematical equations and parametric functions in defining the part geometry while programming reduces the tedious computations required for calculating the locations of each point on the curve. The human errors while computing are reduced and also human errors in defining the coordinate values in the program is eliminated. The time required for programming is reduced and the prior knowledge of either programming or high level language is not required. The central idea of this thesis is to implement the above complex curves with no loss in accuracy for commercial applications. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and create a process for manufacturing replacement glass prisms for the Piedras Blancas lighthouse and several other lighthouses nationwide. The prisms were designed to be in multiple metal arrays spread across {{the floor of the}} beacon room (the topmost room of the lighthouses). The prisms functioned to transmit extra, radiant light from the beacon light through the floor of the beacon room and disperse it into the maintenance room below. Using computer aided drafting (CAD) software, an original prism was measured and modeled; the corresponding mold was also modeled. <b>G-codes</b> for controlling the movement of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill were created to machine the two halves of the mold. A donated block of graphite was machined according to the developed <b>G-codes.</b> As a proof of concept method for casting these prisms, I used a lampworking setup – consisting of a propane-oxygen torch, the associated hoses, regulators, and tanks, an annealing kiln, and the necessary lampworking tools – to melt one end of a borosilicate glass rod into a large gather of molten glass. I forced this gather into the mold, thereby filling the mold, and allowed the glass to solidify. Then I opened the mold, removed the prism, melted off the extra rod, and flattened the top face of the prism. This method, although suitable for the proof of concept, will not be efficient for casting the needed quantity of prisms due to the additional, time consuming steps required. For producing large quantities of these prisms, suggested future work may involve pouring molten glass into the mold via the use of a crucible...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze turning {{performance}} of Aluminium Alloy 6061 based on selected cutting conditions such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut, in terms of acceptable range of surface roughness, with the integration of STEP-NC as a data structure. STEP-NC, an acronym for Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data for Numerical Control is developed by the ISO committee with the intention of replacing the outdated <b>G-codes</b> used for machine execution. <b>G-codes</b> only contain point to point instructions directing the machine to move and machine the parts with lack of intelligence. Important machining parameters such as tolerance information, feature information and cutting tools information are missing and cannot be utilized at CNC level. In addition, it commonly embedded with specific extension of different vendors’ added code depending on its controller making it lacks of interoperability. STEP-NC on the other hand provides comprehensive data structure and may provide information such as material properties, value of surface roughness, part feature and workingstep for the process. In this study, dry cutting operations of a 100 mm Aluminum Alloy 6061 bar were turned into a 50 mm length and 24 mm final diameter based on the combinations of various cutting parameters set using Design of Experiments (DOE) method. The experimental results were statistically analyzed to study the influence of cutting parameters on surface roughness. Based on this, to suit the smart CNC turning environment, regression model were developed and were used in Graphic User Interface (GUI) algorithm in STEP-NC for the surface roughness value output. The outcome of this study shows that feed rate, cutting speed and depth of cut have significance effects on the surface roughness and the best surface roughness condition is achieved at a low feed rate 0. 07 mm/rev, high cutting speed 280 m/min and depth of cut 0. 1 mm. The results also show that the feed rate has big effect on surface roughness followed by cutting speed and depth of cut...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since <b>G-codes</b> {{have been}} proved {{limiting}} the modern manufacturing industry, ISO 14649 was put forward. This paper presents {{a solution to}} generate ISO 14649 files for circuit board milling. The process planning is given, and all the processes needed are contained in the ISO 14649 file. Features and machining operations are identified for each process, such as the closed pocket having a “General_closed_profile ” attribute and bosses, round holes, slots, the planar face, contour parallel strategy, contour bidirectional strategy and etc. The scenario of one feature with multi tools are put forward to promote the milling efficiency and an entity “Combined_Machining_workingsteps ” is proposed. Besides, some other extensions are made, such as entities for representing circuit geometries in machining features. Algorithms for tool paths generation are demonstrated for contour parallel milling and bidirectional milling, where a new algorithm based on pixels is used. The new algorithm {{can be used in}} other functions such as detecting uncut regions...|$|R
