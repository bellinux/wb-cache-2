5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{appears to be an}} elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} rich archaeological and {{linguistic}} evidence of earlier Germanic religious ideas, these sources are all mute, and cannot {{be interpreted with}} much confidence. Seen <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{we know about the}} medieval survival of the Germanic religions as practiced by the Nordic nations, some educated guesses may be made. However, the presence of marked regional differences make generalization of any such reconstructed belief or practice a risky venture.|$|E

25|$|The Reform Judaism movement, {{the largest}} branch of Judaism in North America, has {{rejected}} the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, {{they do not}} prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is seen as current scientific evidence {{about the nature of}} homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, Martin Offiah, who {{was working}} as a pundit for {{broadcaster}} Sky Sports during the match, spoke to the News of the World, stating that he believed the blood replacement in the final minute of extra time where Julien Dupuy returned to the field [...] "looked very suspicious and, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened in the previous round with Harlequins, I think Hipkiss and Leicester should be called to question." [...] Leicester coach Richard Cockerill responded that the replacement was within the laws of the game and that the club had done nothing illegal. ERC confirmed that the match commissioner had spoken to the referee regarding the incident and on the basis that the referee was satisfied, no further action was required. Cardiff also confirmed that they were satisfied that no wrongdoing had taken place and would not seek any further action.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work was}} {{being used by the}} Jews of India during Maimonides' lifetime. In {{response}} to a letter from the Rabbis of Lunel, France requesting him to translate his Guide of the Perplexed from Arabic to Hebrew, Maimonides applauded their piety <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he viewed as the general stagnation of religiosity {{throughout the rest of the}} Jewish world. However, he commented: [...] "Only lately some well-to-do men came forward and purchased three copies of my code [...] which they distributed through messengers...Thus the horizon of these Jews was widened and the religious life in all communities as far as India revived." [...] Further support for the Mishneh Torah circulating in India comes in the form of a letter sent from Safed, Israel to Italy in 1535. In it David del Rossi claimed that a Tripolitan Jewish merchant had told him the India town of Shingly (Cranganore) had a large Jewish population who dabbled in yearly pepper trade with the Portuguese. As far as their religious life, he wrote they: [...] "only recognize the Code of Maimonides and possessed no other authority or Traditional law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} BioShock {{received some}} criticism from PlayStation 3 owners, {{who found the}} port from the native Windows and Xbox 360 developed by a separate studio, Digital Extremes, to be lackluster. To address this, Irrational Games has stated that the PlayStation 3 version of Infinite {{would not be a}} port, as that version is being developed in-house simultaneously with the Windows and Xbox 360 versions. In addition, the PlayStation 3 version of the game will support stereoscopic 3D. BioShock Infinite will support the PlayStation Move motion controller. Though some reports believed that a new Move controller would be produced for the game based on information from Sony, 2K Games debunked these stories, stating that no new hardware is being developed for the game. The North American PlayStation 3 version of the game will include a copy of the original BioShock. Levine has expressed interest in a Wii U version of Infinite <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> abilities the touchscreen controller can offer, but contends that the decision to develop for that platform is [...] "really a discussion that the business people have and see if it makes sense for Nintendo, if it makes sense for Take Two". Aspyr helped to port Infinite to the OS X platform and was released on August 29, 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Seventeenth-century {{philosopher and}} {{scientist}} René Descartes was highly interested in anatomy and physiology. He discussed the pineal gland both {{in his first}} book, the Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664), and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as [...] "the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed." [...] In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul. In the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by [...] "a certain very small gland situated {{in the middle of}} the brain's substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brain's anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities". Descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part rather than one-half of a pair. Most of Descartes's basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards, but also <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was already known in his time.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E
