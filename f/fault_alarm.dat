40|$|Abstract- Network {{survivability}} is {{the ability}} to protect and restore the data in optical network after nodes and/or links fail. Till now, many kinds of protection/restoration mechanisms proposed, but their realizations depend in part on triggering of <b>fault</b> <b>alarms</b> and corresponding detection of fault location. If a failure occurs in the network without being detected or the failure cannot be localized exactly, it will lead to network’s inability to start the normal protection/restoration mechanism. Hence, fault detection and location is a direct impact on network survivability. Fault location problem in optical network has been difficult to deal with, because when network failures happen, all related nodes and detection points will report alarms. When many alarms reach the manager through the management communication network, it becomes difficult to locate the multi failures exactly without much troublesome manual checking and measuring...|$|R

30|$|The FMS {{applications}} {{perform a}} variety of analytics and are mostly characterized by a reactive behavior. They receive (monitoring) data, e.g., a change in vehicles’ operation and, as a response, perform (control) actions. Such monitoring and control tasks are executing in heterogeneous, dynamic FMS environment and interact with many geographically distributed vehicles and their low-level capabilities, e.g., engine control points. Further, FMS applications have different requirements regarding communication protocols. For example, the <b>fault</b> <b>alarms</b> need to be pushed to the services, e.g, via MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and vehicle’s diagnostics should be synchronously accessed via RESTful protocols such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) or Simple Measurement and Actuation Profile (sMAP). Therefore, from the developers perspective such tasks and capabilities need to be decoupled from the underlying physical infrastructure, but also easily specified, provisioned and managed programmatically (as code), without worrying about the complexity of low-level device services, communication channels and raw sensory data streams.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Plating of {{metallic}} Lithium (Li) is {{an important}} battery degradation, failure mechanism, and a safety concern of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries during charging process, which can short circuit the battery and lead to uncontrollable energetic chemical reactions. It happens when the transport rate of Li ions to the negative electrode exceeds the rate that Li ions can be inserted (intercalated) into the graphite. This paper presents a two-step Plating Mechanism Detection (PMD) algorithm {{which is based on}} the model-based fault diagnosis theory. In the first step, an estimation of the Li ions ’ transport rate in both positive and negative electrodes is obtained from an electrochemical model of the battery through a particle filtering approach.

To this purpose, two approaches are proposed in this work.

The latter is based on the preprocessing of the signals by means of Haar wavelet transforms. The performance of the two proposed approaches are compared to that of the traditional reconstruction approach used for stationary conditions, with respect to a case study concerning {{the condition}} monitoring of a gas turbine during start-up transients...|$|E

However, this becomes challenging when investigating <b>fault</b> <b>alarms</b> that cannot be verified, diagnosed or even duplicated under standard manual inspection regimes.

Understanding occurrences in parameter deviations (and their impact) can help with understanding the requirements for improving system fault tolerance. It is shown that, in many cases of practical importance, components {{do not have the same}} sensitivity to intermittent variations and hence can be better suited for monitoring.

The pursued general approach to the real-time adaptive estimation of complete traffic state in freeway stretches or networks is based on stochastic nonlinear macroscopic traffic flow modeling and extended Kalman filtering. One major innovative aspect of the estimator is the real-time joint estimation of traffic flow variables (flows, mean speeds, and densities) and some important model parameters (free speed, critical density, and capacity), which leads to four significant features of the traffic state estimator: (i) avoidance of prior model calibration; (ii) automatic adaptation to changing external conditions (e. g. weather and lighting conditions, traffic composition, control measures); (iii) enabling of incident alarms; (iv) enabling of detector <b>fault</b> <b>alarms.</b> The purpose of the reported real-data testing is, first, to demonstrate feature (i) by investigating some basic properties of the estimator and, second, to explore some adaptive capabilities of the estimator that enable features (ii) -(iv).
