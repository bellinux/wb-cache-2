40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need <b>for</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to corpus consultation, and how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|E
40|$|Although many {{researchers}} {{have shown the}} positive effects of teacher feedback on second language (L 2) writing, it is still unclear to what extent L 2 learners are able to self-correct their errors accurately in their revisions responding to indirect teacher feedback. Likewise, potential application of electronic corpora that improves L 2 writers 2 ̆ 7 writing skills has been explored over the past decade. However, there are only few empirical studies examining the effect of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by L 2 learners on improved learning outcomes. ^ The present study investigated the role that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> plays in the correction of errors via four types of indirect feedback (uncoded indirect feedback only, coded indirect feedback only, uncoded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> and coded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation)</b> <b>for</b> lower level Japanese as Foreign Language (JFL) learners. It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only. Likewise, from the short-term perspective, uncoded feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was significantly more effective than uncoded/coded indirect feedback only. As to long-term effect, however, <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> had a significant positive effect when uncoded indirect feedback was provided on the students 2 ̆ 7 writings. Overall, the JFL learners expressed positive attitudes toward the use of corpus and agreed that it was beneficial to improve their writing skills. In specific, as compared to traditional references such as a paper-based dictionary and a textbook, they felt that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was more helpful. ...|$|R
40|$|Alongside {{developments}} in language research, {{the potential of}} corpora as a resource in language learning and teaching has been evident to researchers and teachers since the late 1960 s. Despite publications which emphasise the benefits of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>for</b> language learners (Bernardini, 2002; Kennedy & Miceli, 2001), {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> is coming {{to be seen as a}} complement or alternative to consultation of a dictionary, course book, or grammar by the majority of learners. There is thus a need for research to underpin the integration of corpora and concordancing in the language-learning environment. This study begins with an account of published research relating to course design and structure in the area of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by language learners. The focus then narrows to the initial training of learners in <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> using as an example a course involving undergraduate students on several language degree programmes. The results of the students 2 ̆ 7 <b>consultation</b> of the <b>corpora</b> are examined, including choice of search word(s), analytical skills, the problems encountered, and their evaluation of the activity.

40|$|International audienceCorpora in {{language}} learning {{are not the}} sole preserve of teachers: {{they can also be}} used directly by learners to promote autonomy and language awareness. However, this “data-driven learning” (DDL) approach has not been widely taken up in traditional teaching contexts, partly because it is thought to require substantial resources and considerable investment {{on the part of the}} teachers, as well as being appropriate only for the most advanced learners following specific training. This paper addresses these issues in describing an experiment with lower-intermediate learners of English, 43 undergraduate students at a technical college in France. The study suggests that the use of a <b>corpus</b> <b>for</b> DDL-style <b>consultation</b> in conjunction with other resources (dictionaries and on-line translation engines) allows these learners to improve written work without help from a teacher...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{learning}} has been increasingly incorporated into learners' <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> {{as a type}} of pedagogic mediation. However, studies found that collaborative {{learning has}} negative aspects as it may cause conflicts and power inequality among members. Given the two sides of collaboration, this study provides a critical investigation on the functions of collaboration in learners' <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> Through two collaborative corpus analysis sessions, three students of different L 2 proficiency levels assisted each other’s understanding of corpus data to complete group activities. The students’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors during corpus analysis became the main source of investigation, complemented by the results of pre-/post-interviews and the researcher's direct observations. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} collaboration creates significant power inequality among the participants by gradually marginalizing the less capable student in the group from the learning process and increasing the psychological burden for the most capable student. In addition, collaborative work during <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could impede critical learning opportunities for individual students to pursue personal queries during collaboration. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study provide a realistic picture of collaboration in learners’ <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> and suggest pedagogical implications to corpus-based instruction...|$|R
40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, electronic literacies have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

One possibility is that quantitative results conceal the diversity of learner profiles.

These results are then analysed in relation to learning preferences {{as measured by the}} Index of Learning Styles, an instrument which goes much further than the traditional inductive-deductive dimensions. If the advantages of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> can be connected to specific learning styles, this could help teachers to use corpora more efficiently in class and adapt the procedures to different contexts...|$|R

40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{has contributed}} considerably to the arsenal of tools available for language description, with methodologies applicable to virtually any area of language study. Yet like most academic disciplines, corpus linguistics is generally limited to researchers and other professionals; {{in the fields}} of foreign/second language teaching and learning, this involves considerable mediation upstream before the results filter down to the end users - teachers and learners. An alternative would be <b>for</b> <b>corpus</b> data to feature directly in the learning process, with learners acting as "researchers" to explore the language themselves. This is commonly referred to as "data-driven learning" (DDL), an idea particularly associated with the seminal collection of papers edited by Johns and King (1991). The last 20 years has seen substantial research interest in DDL, with countless scholarly articles arguing its various merits, though it is frequently remarked that empirical research is disturbingly lacking. However, Boulton (forthcoming) lists over 70 studies which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> This suggests that the research exists, but is fragmented and lacking in visibility and accessibility to a wider community. The aim of the present paper is to bring together the DDL research in ESP, where Gavioli (2005) argues convincingly that the learners represent a major population who stand to gain from DDL. An overview is presented of the tools, corpora, methodologies and research questions covered in 20 empirical DDL studies for ESP. The overwhelming majority show that learners are able to work with corpora in many contexts and for many purposes, and respond positively to the approach. In terms of learning outcomes, the results are generally promising, though not perhaps as conclusive as one might hope. Reasons for this are discussed, but it is argued that there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding corpus use in ESP {{in a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|R

To this end, 26 corpus project work assignments produced by two different groups of students were assessed and tagged according to specific parameters that reflect the skills needed in corpus analysis. The data were analysed applying both parametric (ANOVA) and non parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test), which showed that, despite clear individual and teaching/learning environment {{differences between the two}} groups of students, the students’ results in most of the tasks were due to different levels of intrinsic difficulty.
