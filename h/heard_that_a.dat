5|$|In May 1993, {{the band}} <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> record {{executive}} from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut's in Glasgow. Together, {{they found the}} money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had {{been added to the}} bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
25|$|In Bihar, the Muslim widows were stated to be {{carrying}} out a related practice. Buchanan Hamilton in his early 19th century Shahabad report wrote that Sati-like practice had spread to Muhammadans because he had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> widow had herself buried in the coffin of her dead husband.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} story, he <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> horse {{was to be}} put down, so he bought the horse, bought a few grassy acres nearby, and turned it out to recover. When it did, he gave the horse to someone needy, {{exacting}} a promise to treat it humanely.|$|E
25|$|The captain, first officer, flight engineer, {{a flight}} attendant, and several First Class {{passengers}} were found still strapped {{to their seats}} inside the nose section when it crashed in a field by a tiny church {{in the village of}} Tundergarth. The inquest <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> flight attendant was found alive by a farmer's wife, but died before her discoverer could summon help. Some passengers may have remained alive briefly after impact; a pathologist report concluded that at least two of these passengers might have survived if they had been found soon enough.|$|E
25|$|After a fruitless {{attempt to}} seize Valencia in March, Suchet {{determined}} {{to move against}} Lérida. By mid-April, the French were before the city. Suchet <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Spanish army commanded by Henry O'Donnell was trying {{to interfere with the}} planned operation. O'Donnell's column was intercepted and in the Battle of Margalef on 23 April, it was routed with heavy losses. This action was followed by a siege in which Suchet used brutal methods to bring a speedy surrender. On 13 May, García Conde capitulated with his 7,000 surviving soldiers. This event was the start of an astonishing series of successful sieges from 1810 to 1812 in which Suchet's troops seemed to be unstoppable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it was you, senor! We <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> English {{officer was}} {{in command of}} the troops who cut all the roads, and took numbers of French prisoners, and {{defeated}} 5000 of their troops and, as they said, nearly captured Valladolid and Burgos." ...|$|R

"Chebron, tell Mysa to come here," [...] Ameres said, and the lad at once fetched Mysa, who {{had already}} <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Israelite girl was coming to be her special attendant, and had been much {{interested}} in Chebron's account of her and her rescue from the crocodile.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lindsay's {{prevision}} {{turned out}} correct. Harry remained a week longer at Parley House. Then he <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> estate was for sale, two miles away, and drove over quietly to inspect it. Ten {{days later he}} wrote from London, {{and said that he}} had bought the place.|$|R
25|$|After a {{brief period}} of farmworking and odd jobs at Mount Vernon, New York, Riis {{returned}} to New York, where he read in the newspaper New York Sun that the newspaper was recruiting soldiers for the war. Riis rushed there to enlist, but the editor (whom he later realized was Charles Anderson Dana) claimed or affected ignorance but offered the famished Riis a dollar for breakfast; Riis indignantly refused. Riis was destitute, at one time sleeping on a tombstone and surviving on windfall apples. Still, he found work at a brickyard at Little Washington in New Jersey, and was there for six weeks until he <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group of volunteers were going to the war. Thereupon he left for New York.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1952, Garfield {{moved out}} of his New York {{apartment}} for the last time, indicating to friends {{it was not a}} temporary separation from his wife Roberta. He confided to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in Look magazine that triggered the separation. He <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called Taxi, but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.|$|E
25|$|The way to Martaban was now open. Unlike before, Laukpya had not {{opened the}} western front. But Byattaba did not panic. He {{still had the}} support of his other brothers, E Bya Bon and U-Lo, who were commanders in his army, and had {{collected}} enough men and arms. When the Martaban command <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Pegu army was taking a circuitous route through the woods to encircle the city from the east, the brothers planned a surprise attack outside the city. In the wee hours, the Martaban army, led by the three brothers themselves, ambushed and destroyed the five vanguard regiments of the Pegu army. But the Martaban command did not know that two Pegu rearguard regiments, led by generals Smim Than-Byat and Dein, were still in the area. While the Martaban army dispersed to mop up the remaining enemies in the area, Than-Byat launched a surprise attack targeting the battalions guarding the Martaban command. It worked. Byattaba, E Bya Bon and U-Lo all fled. The remaining Martaban forces surrendered.|$|E

25|$|In October 1942, the Kamionka Jewish council (Judenrat) {{informed}} the Jewish residents {{that they would}} be resettled in the Lubartów Ghetto. Blaichman slipped out of Kamionka and went to a gentile farmer in the village of Kierzkówka who offered him assistance (the family of Aleksander and Stanisława Głos, which would later be listed among the Polish Righteous Among the Nations). He later learned that the Jews of Kamionka had not been relocated to the Lubartów Ghetto but rather were deported on trains to an unknown destination. Blaichman <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group of Jews were hiding in the forest, so after two days with the farmer, {{he made his way to}} the forest and found more than one hundred Jews living in an encampment of small bunkers in the forest. He realized that the group was in constant danger. Blaichman encouraged the group to form a defense unit to guard the camp even though they had no firearms. In December 1942 the group managed to acquire firearms from a local Polish farmer. (However, according to another biography, it was only in summer of 1943 that Blaichman left the Głos family and joined the resistance).|$|E
25|$|William Carson (July 15, 1825 New Brunswick – February 20, 1912 Eureka), {{for whom}} the house was built, arrived in San Francisco from New Brunswick, Canada, {{with a group of}} other woodsmen in 1849. After rolling out gold slugs in San Francisco, they joined in the {{northern}} gold rush, arriving in the Trinity Mountains via the Eel River and Humboldt Bay. They left the Trinity Mountains to overwinter at Humboldt Bay and contracted to provide logs for a small sawmill. In November 1850 Carson and Jerry Whitmore felled a tree, the first for commercial purposes on Humboldt Bay. All winter, Carson and his team hauled logs from the Freshwater slough to the Pioneer Mill on the shores of Humboldt Bay. In spring, the party went back to the mines where they had previously staked claim on Big Bar by the Trinity. They built a dam and continued mining until they <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large sawmill was being built at Humboldt Bay. They went south through the Sacramento Valley, bought oxen, and returned to Humboldt Bay by August 1852, where Carson, alone, went into the lumber business permanently. In 1854, he shipped the first loads of redwood timber to San Francisco. Previously, only fir and spruce had been logged.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year (497 BC), Onesilus (still besieging Amathus), <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Persian force under Artybius had been dispatched to Cyprus. Onesilus thus sent messengers to Ionia, {{asking them to}} send reinforcements, which they did, [...] "in great force". A Persian army eventually arrived in Cyprus, supported by a Phoenician fleet. The Ionians opted to fight at sea and defeated the Phoenicians. In the simultaneous land battle, the Cypriots gained an initial advantage, killing Artybius. However, the defection of two contingents to the Persians crippled their cause, they were routed and Onesilus was killed. The revolt in Cyprus was thus crushed and the Ionians sailed home.|$|E
60|$|The last halting-place {{was at a}} villa {{belonging}} to a Roman, where they <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> assembly was being held in the fields near Bordigala for judgment on the slaughter of a young Goth of high rank. On learning how deeply they were concerned, their host lent them two horses, and rode with them himself, as they hastened on in speechless anxiety.|$|R

500|$|A fifth {{movie was}} written, {{and may have}} been produced, but it was never released. Frankie Thomas {{believes}} that he and Granville made five films, not four, and in August 1939 Harriet Adams wrote to Mildred Benson, [...] "three have been shown in this area, and I have just <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fifth is in production." [...] The cancellation of the series was a result of Bonita Granville and Glenda Farrell both leaving the studio (Granville going to MGM and Farrell returning to the stage), Warner Bros. deciding to discontinue both series after the final Torchy Blane film (with Jane Wyman replacing Farrell) flopped, and the onset of World War II.|$|E
500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al-Rashid Mosque:The Al-Rashid Mosque has the {{distinction}} of being the first purpose-built mosque in Canada. Though it was built in 1938, outside of 1920 Street's apparent range, its move to Fort Edmonton Park saved it from demolition. Historically, many Muslim immigrants to Canada chose to live in Edmonton [...] because they had <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mosque was there.|$|E
60|$|Then Jone {{went on to}} {{say that}} of course he could not make head or tail out of such <b>a</b> story as <b>that,</b> but when he <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> awful row had been kicked up in a garden he {{immediately}} thought that as like as not I was in it, and so he and Mr. Poplington ran back, leaving their bicycles against the hedge, and bringing the young man with them.|$|R
25|$|The {{meetings}} in the Home District met with an increasing amount of Orange Order violence, so that the reformers began to protect themselves and resort to arms to do so. Mackenzie was accompanied by 50 young farmers from the Lloydtown meeting, for example, after they <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Orange riot was planned for Albion. As the violence continued, peaceable reform meetings tapered off in October, {{to be replaced by}} instances of men drilling for battle.|$|R

2500|$|... 1996 – Robert Wilensky once jocularly remarked, [...] "We've all <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> million monkeys {{banging on}} a million {{typewriters}} will eventually reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare.

2500|$|Having <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{person might}} pawn his {{soul to the}} Devil for a {{thousand}} pounds, Pierce decides to seek a solution in that direction and appeal to the Devil, reasoning that if the Devil were to remove certain souls {{from the land of}} the living and recruit them into his domain where they belong, it would liberate and make available the wealth that they've been hoarding: [...] Gold—that “mighty controller of fortune and imperious subverter of destiny, delicious gold, the poor man's god, and idol of princes.” ...|$|E

50|$|Campbell {{began his}} speed record {{attempts}} {{in the summer}} of 1949, using his father's old boat, Blue Bird K4, which he renamed Bluebird K4. His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful, although he did come close to raising his father's existing record. The team returned to Coniston Water, Lancashire in 1950 for further trials. While there, they <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> American, Stanley Sayers, had raised the record from 141 to 160 mph, beyond K4's capabilities without substantial modification.|$|R
