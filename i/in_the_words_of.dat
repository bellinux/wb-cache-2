5|$|In a {{collaboration}} with Kliment Voroshilov, Molotov contributed both musically and lyrically to the 1944 {{version of the}} Soviet national anthem. Molotov asked the writers to include a line or two about peace. Molotov's and Voroshilov's role {{in the making of}} the new Soviet anthem was, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, acting as music judges for Stalin.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's {{frequent use of}} religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or {{might have been a}} device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} six days, the Japanese attacked the bridgehead, launching {{a series of}} assaults that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Robert Burla, bordered upon suicidal. These attacks were repulsed and the Australians began to launch patrols in all directions around the ridge. On 29 January, the Japanese launched a large-scale attack on 'C' Company's positions and although the Australians resisted, the attack succeeded in breaking through {{one part of the}} perimeter and managed to roll up the position {{all the way to the}} main battalion position around Puto before it was turned back. The Australian counter-attack, organised by the 'C' Company's commander, Captain Alwyn Shilton, and supported by accurate artillery fire, came on 1 February and resulted in over 30 Japanese killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scholars}} have emphasised, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Ármann Jakobsson, that:the {{time has come}} to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> Christianity, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> {{wisdom is}} a spiritual gift listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8. The {{function}} that this gift is given varies.

This gift is closely related with <b>the</b> gift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> knowledge.|$|R

5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|Tự Đức {{continued}} {{to hope that}} Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain {{the possibility of a}} territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court of violating the treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this as a pretext to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên and An Giang.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E

5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E
5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Plovdiv did {{not seem}} to have had a {{profound}} effect on Ivan's career, and he remained a royal favourite. In 1328, Ivan was tasked by Tsar Michael Shishman with the defence of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the residence of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. Andronikos II, facing imminent defeat at the hands of his grandson and co-emperor Andronikos III in a protracted civil war, was distrustful of his own guard, and had requested the assistance of Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor sent Ivan the Russian along with 3,000 horsemen to Constantinople in aid. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine historian Nikephoros Gregoras, the actual intentions of Michael Shishman were to use Ivan and his men as a Trojan Horse. In a suitable moment, the Bulgarian guard would arrest the emperor and take hold of the palace before allowing Michael Shishman with a large army and Tatar mercenaries into Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E
