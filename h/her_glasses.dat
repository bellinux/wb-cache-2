5|$|Stafford {{appeared}} in films from the 1930s onwards, including Alexander's Ragtime Band. Her final on-screen appearance {{was in the}} Frank Sinatra tribute Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come in 1990. She declined several offers of television work because {{she was forced to}} memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without <b>her</b> <b>glasses),</b> and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is shocked when Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) yells at him, and is unsure {{how to handle the}} situation. Michael tries to assert his power over Stanley, by pretending to fire him, but that only makes matters worse. The two eventually end up alone in the office. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) receives a warning about his job performance, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is forced to wear <b>her</b> <b>glasses,</b> and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) buys Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) car.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
60|$|Of the two Mrs. Watson was {{certainly}} the most nervous. Her fingers shook so that the wine in <b>her</b> <b>glass</b> was spilt. She set <b>her</b> <b>glass</b> down and looked across at her companion.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, an {{undercover}} investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) used a camera hidden in <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> to make 50 hours of {{videotape of the}} HLS laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. She also made four 90-minute audiotapes, photocopied 8,000 company documents, and copied the company's client list. According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, Alan Staple, said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.|$|E
25|$|Gallant {{at first}} {{considered}} the possibility that Philip had used the attack to flee her mounting personal problems and {{start a new life}} under a new identity. But her computer's hard drive revealed no evidence of any such plans or contacts, and she had also left <b>her</b> <b>glasses,</b> passport, driver's license and credit cards, except the American Express card, behind. Lieberman kept the account open in case any leads developed from attempts to use it, but none ever did. Gallant and Lieberman eventually concluded that Philip witnessed the attack and, as a physician, rushed to the site to render aid and subsequently perished there, either within the towers or in the ensuing collapse.|$|E
25|$|Shigure is {{the student}} council {{president}} and hugely {{popular with the}} ladies. He {{comes across as a}} sweet guy so he can get the girls to confess their love to him and then reject them for fun. After Yukina blackmails him, Shigure does things to try to get out of it, one of them being finding out <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> secret to no avail. Shigure denies that he has feelings for Yukina but for some reason can't understand why he feels he needs to keep Yukina to himself. He is also jealous of Akira and Hisame but denies it, he later on confesses his love to Yukina but because of her unsure feelings in the past, she did not respond to his feelings until after Shigure came back from his studies and told him her feelings. They started going out.|$|E

500|$|The Oregon writer Stewart Holbrook {{interview}}ed {{her in the}} early 1950s, {{a few years after}} her retirement, observing that she [...] "still weighs 104 pounds. Her eyes are clear and blue behind <b>her</b> <b>glasses.</b> There is not a gray hair on her head. She lives as quietly as she has always lived, except for those dreadful few days so long ago [...]" [...] Holbrook noted during his interview that [...] "the subject of Copperfield bores her" [...] and concluded his account of her as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|According to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her {{ubiquitous}} sunglasses {{are actually}} corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision {{as her father}} did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy. [...] "I {{think at this point}} they've become, you know, really armour," [...] Wintour herself told 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private. As she rebounded from the end of her marriage and the turnover in the magazine's editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that [...] "she's not hiding behind <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> anymore. Now she's having fun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), after {{spending}} the night at [...] "a friend's" [...] (Jim's) house, forgot her contact lens solution, so she must wear <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> all day. She finds it difficult to handle Michael's criticism and Kevin's sexual advances, and spends {{the rest of the}} day without <b>her</b> <b>glasses,</b> reducing her productivity. [...] Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) comes to Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, and after a talk with Toby, Ryan tells Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that he is giving him an official warning about his job performance. Ryan denies that his action is motivated by Jim's previous complaints to David Wallace, saying he thrives on constructive criticism (while Toby's comments to the documentary crew indicate he is not upset about the warning, owing to his envy of Jim's relationship with Pam). [...] Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is selling his 2001 Nissan Xterra for $8,700, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) pressures him into selling it for $1,500 less than the asking price, because according to Dwight, [...] " [...] car is crap". Dwight assures Andy that he will only use it as a wagon and dragged by a mule on Dwight's beet farm. Andy then sells it to Dwight, who, in a passive-aggressive method of getting back at him for dating Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), washes it and posts a sign asking for $9,995 for the vehicle, which upsets Andy when he finds Dwight's advertisement posted on the cabinet in the office kitchen. Dwight declares that it is already on Ebay which he claims is the subject of a three-way bidding war.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her {{duration}} {{she held}} a nickname [...] "Plain Jane Superbrain", for her early intelligent, yet geeky image, which she was referred to by other character and media alike. She is portrayed as a mousy type character, going on a journey of self-discovery as she transformed into a heart breaker. Her most notable point in this storyline is her makeover in which she wears make-up in place of <b>her</b> <b>glasses,</b> dresses sexy and acts thick {{in order to win}} Mike Young's (Guy Pearce) heart. Her makeover has been well documented by critics and holds a place in popular culture, where she is often referred to in cases of extreme makeovers. However, some academic publications have criticised her makeover for conforming to the stereo type that females cannot be sexy and intelligent at the same time. Jones also received the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress while portraying Jane.|$|E
500|$|Leeds culture website, Leeds Confidential {{stated the}} [...] "makeover genre" [...] has always fascinated them and {{mentioned}} the makeover as their prime example. Europe’s leading drinks trade publication, The Drinks Business compared Jane to their brand of Antipodean beer commenting it's not as bland as it first appears. However {{they said that}} Jane is [...] "notoriously nerdy". TV Cream refer to Jane as the [...] "neighbourhood dag" [...] and stated that she conformed to the [...] "plain, bespectacled, bookish female" [...] taking <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> off and becoming the [...] "ravishing beauty", they also brand her a minx for her antics with Scott. Sky Showbiz brand Jane as the serial's [...] "super swot". Rod McPhee of Yorkshire Evening Post, stated that she went from [...] "ostracised bookworm, who one day went from mousey nobody to sought-after siren, all because she lost the lenses". Additionly, he was confused why popular culture feels the need downgrade or upgrade someone's sex appeal {{because of the presence}} or absence of glasses. Geoff Dean also agrees with this point in his book [...] "English for Gifted and Talented Students: 11–18 Years". However he added that able students seem to [...] "lack a positive collective story or identity", making an example of Jane.|$|E
500|$|Naomi Alderman of The Guardian branded her {{purposely}} failing her maths {{tests to}} get Mike's attention as [...] "ridiculous", however she added: [...] "As a teenager I remember having earnest discussions with other girls about it: {{was it really}} true? Did men not like clever girls? Ought we to try to appear less clever?" [...] Whilst Owen Gibson of the newspaper said she was the [...] "school swot" [...] before she turned into a [...] "beauty queen". Columnist Felicity Cloake compiled an advice guide to attending Christmas parties for the workplace, on style she advised her readers to look to Jane for inspiration {{if they want to}} [...] "dress to impress". Josh Burt of entertainment website Hecklerspray ran a make over feature inspired by Jane's make over, he also branded Jane a whore and said he thought her make over was astonishing. He also stated: [...] "Ever since Plain Jane the Superbrain took off <b>her</b> <b>glasses,</b> smeared some slutty red lipstick around her mouth, and rubbed ice cubes on her stupid nipples, the celebrity makeover has been a must for anyone hoping to increase their fame. For those unaware, the whole Plain Jane thing happened in the Australian drama serial, Neighbours. She went from geek to whore in a matter of moments." ...|$|E

500|$|Character {{designs were}} cooperatively handled by Kunihiko Tanaka and Kouichi Mugitani, while mecha designs were handled by Mugitani and Junya Ishigaki. Mugitani also {{worked on the}} game as {{production}} designer. The art director was Yasuyuki Honne, who had previously worked on both Xenogears and Chrono Cross, while character motion was handled by Norihiro Takami. Honne collaborated with Takami in creating the character motions for cutscenes. When creating the designs, Tanaka was given an outline of a character by Takahashi in addition to comparisons with real-life actors, and then created the designs from that. Tanaka's art style—which gave characters large eyes dominating their faces—provided a challenge for the team as Takahashi wanted to be {{as close to the}} original artwork as possible, but the expressive power of the large-eyed facial design could easily be [...] "destroyed" [...] by the wrong lighting. Takami worked hard on character models to make sure the large eye styling was preserved without upsetting the model's balance. Mugitani and Ishigaki respectively handled the designs for Vector staff and the Federation. KOS-MOS was initially designed by Tanaka, but he had considerable trouble finalizing her design. Mugitani then contributed, creating something close to KOS-MOS's final design, which was then polished by Tanaka. Tanaka also had difficulty creating Shion's design, giving <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> as an easy way of showing her personality.|$|E
2500|$|Mari Shimazaki {{designed}} the game's characters to be [...] "fashionable", with [...] "subdued" [...] features. She {{designed the}} titular character to fulfill Kamiya's {{request for a}} modern, female witch that wears glasses and wields four guns, and the two settled on her original concept for the character despite her work [...] "over a year" [...] on other concepts. Bayonetta emerged as a long-haired, black-clothed witch with a beehive hairdo (in place of the traditional pointy hat) and glasses (which Kamiya [...] "really pushed for... to differentiate Bayonetta from other female characters {{and give her a}} sense of mystery and intelligence"). Conversely, Shimazaki [...] "didn't require a huge amount of effort" [...] to design Bayonetta's short-haired, red-clothed rival Jeanne, who merely wears <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> on her head above her eyes. She added plumes to Jeanne's handguns to add movement to the design, and thick makeup to Jeanne's face to [...] "make [...] feel like something out of the 1960s". Though Shimazaki preferred Bayonetta, Jeanne {{turned out to be the}} more popular of the two witches among Kamiya and the development team. [...] Still, in an April 2009 interview, Kamiya called the former [...] "in many ways... my ideal woman".|$|E
2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from <b>her</b> <b>glasses.</b> There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out in her black outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance." [...] The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made from her hair. Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look.|$|E

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with <b>her</b> <b>glasses</b> on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
