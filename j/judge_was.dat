5|$|An 1872 statute {{modified}} the certificate of division procedure to require {{waiting for a}} final decision in the circuit court case first. In the interim, {{the opinion of the}} presiding <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> to prevail. An 1874 statute repealed the 1872 modification as to criminal cases, but left it in place as to civil cases.|$|E
5|$|Anyone {{wishing to}} become a <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to be a Serjeant-at-law, which Murray was not; as such, he left Lincoln's Inn to join Serjeant's Inn. He qualified as a Serjeant-at-law on 8 November 1756, and {{was sworn in as}} Lord Chief Justice at the house of the Lord Chancellor that evening. Immediately afterwards he was created Baron Mansfield.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{arrived in}} Fort Smith on May 4, 1875, {{initially}} without his family. His appointment at age 36 {{made him the}} youngest federal judge in the West. Parker's first session as the district <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> on May 10, 1875, with court prosecutor W. H. H. Clayton, who remained the United States Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas for fourteen of Parker's twenty-one years on the court.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Judge</b> <b>was</b> always {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, {{with his}} sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in the March and December races) and the 1852 race, while the starter was Edward Searle and the {{finishing}} <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> E. H. Fairrie.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

25|$|There {{are both}} {{volunteer}} and professional judges. A volunteer judge, {{such as an}} English magistrate, {{is not required to}} have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> required to be legally educated; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> often appointed from experienced attorneys. <b>Judges</b> <b>are</b> often appointed by the head of state. In some U.S. jurisdictions, however, <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> elected in a political election.|$|R
5|$|In December 1943 a <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> taken ill, and Denning {{was asked}} {{to take his place}} as a Commissioner of Assize. This was {{regarded}} as a 'trial' for membership of the judiciary, and Denning was appointed Recorder of Plymouth on 17 February 1944. On 6 March 1944, while arguing a case in the House of Lords, Denning was taken aside by the Lord Chancellor and told that he wanted Denning to become a judge at the High Court of Justice in the Probate, Admiralty and Divorce Division. Denning accepted, and the announcement was made before the conclusion of the trial.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early {{settlement}} period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E
5000|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as in the past. Critics argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. [...] "legislating from the bench"), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> addressing substance instead of process.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} brief glosses on six minor judges: Shamgar (3:31), Tola and Jair (10:1–5), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15). Some {{scholars}} have inferred that the minor <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> actual adjudicators, whereas the major <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> leaders and didn't actually make legal judgements. The only time a major <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} made legal judgments was Deborah (4:4).|$|R
5000|$|The officiating {{position}} {{titles of}} back judge and field <b>judge</b> <b>were</b> swapped {{to become more}} consistent with college and high school football. The field <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> now 20 yards deep, positioned on the same sideline as the line judge, while the back <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> 25 yards from {{the line of scrimmage}} {{near the center of the}} field.|$|R
5|$|He {{arranged}} {{a new system}} to appoint judges. Instead of simply proposing a new judge candidate to the Congress, the presidency first released names {{of a number of}} potential candidates, who were then evaluated by several non-governmental organizations, who assessed if the candidate was suitable as a judge. The ministry of justice compiled all the support and criticism, and the president then decided which candidate would be proposed to the Congress, which made the final decision, as under the previous system. Raúl Zaffaroni, a former FREPASO politician, was the first judicial appointment under the new system. He was followed by Elena Highton de Nolasco, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. The appointment of Carmen Argibay (another female <b>judge)</b> <b>was</b> controversial, since Argibay was an atheist and a supporter of legal abortion. The judges held liberal views on criminal justice, countering social demands for harsher, pro-victim policies after the murder of Axel Blumberg. However, the new Supreme Court had little political power, as the national government ignored all rulings that were not favorable.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E
50|$|The {{tribunal}} {{acts as the}} Supreme Court as {{a constitutional}} court. Its <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> appointed by the National Assembly, its current <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> Silvrestre da Fonseca Leite.|$|R
5000|$|A lay <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{a person}} {{assisting}} {{a judge in}} a trial and as such are sometimes called lay assessors. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> used in some civil law jurisdictions. Japan began implementing a new lay judge system in 2009. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> appointed volunteers and often require some legal instruction. However, they are not permanent officers, as they tend proceedings about once a month, and often receive only nominal or [...] "costs covered" [...] pay. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> usually used when the country does not have juries. Lay <b>judges</b> may <b>be</b> randomly selected for a single trial (like jurymen), or politically appointed. In the latter case, they may usually not be rejected by the prosecution, the defense, or the permanent <b>judges.</b> Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> similar to magistrates of England and Wales, but magistrates sit about twice more often.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Judges</b> <b>are</b> not Beamte, {{although}} they were until the mid-1950s. Until then, <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> also paid according to Order A, and usually had the titles [...] "Justiz-" [...] or [...] "Gerichtsrat". However, officials represent {{the executive branch of}} government, while <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> independent of the government. Beamte have a duty to obey direct orders from a superior, which is incompatible with an independent system of justice.|$|R
5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme <b>Judge</b> <b>was</b> elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe <b>Judge</b> <b>was</b> walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} Baron sat {{to hear a}} case, with {{convention}} insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> added to the Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of}} the court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. Unlike in the Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote in decisions.|$|E
50|$|A reserve <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{a former}} <b>judge</b> or, on occasion, an {{appointed}} official who offers their {{services as a}} substitute judge when required. Reserve judges either supplement judges in jurisdictions {{that do not have}} the number of judges needed, or act as an alternate judge in jurisdictions with a single judge when that <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> substituted or must recuse himself. Reserve <b>judges</b> may also <b>be</b> used as substitutes when another <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> ill or on vacation.|$|R

5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first Restatement of Torts for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was treated to a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the Restatement compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, home visits and live shows. Auditions {{in front of}} the show's producers took place throughout March and April 2011. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place {{in front of the}} judges and a live studio audience during May and June. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys (male soloists aged 14 to 24), Under 25 Girls (female soloists aged 14 to 24), Over 25s (soloists aged 25 and over) and Groups. Each <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts after day two, and their six acts after day three. Special guest judges, including Wynter Gordon, Stephen Belafonte, Darren Hayes and The Veronicas, were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp was the home visits stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges including Beyoncé, Melanie C, Jason Derulo, Good Charlotte and Leona Lewis. The live shows began on 19 September 2011.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven courts were located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven courts were part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{the county}} <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> a {{statutory}} member of several important boards, including the juvenile {{board and the}} county election commission. Finally, the <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> designated by a long-standing executive order of the governor, pursuant to the Texas Disaster Act of 1974, as the executive officer for civil defense within the county. The county <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> elected county wide to a four-year term coinciding with the term of the governor.|$|R
