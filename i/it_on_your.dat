Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> first attempt."

[...] His musical skills allowed him to play clarinet with the orchestra at the Capital University Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where he rose to the status of principal soloist before he was 16. Although Ochs played classical music, he soon became interested in other sounds he heard on the radio, such as early rock icons Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley and country music artists including Faron Young, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams, Sr., and Johnny Cash. Ochs also {{spent a lot of time}} at the movies. He especially liked big screen heroes such as John Wayne and Audie Murphy. Later on, he developed an interest in movie rebels, including Marlon Brando and James Dean.|$|E

None of these were played during the first four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour diary entry on U2.com that the band [...] "really wants [...] to work and it sounds great", {{but the rest of the}} setlist struggled due to the song's [...] "beautiful melancholy". In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams noted that [...] "October" [...] and [...] "White as Snow" [...] were also being considered. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] were rehearsed in an acoustic style, but performances during the tour were done by the full band. Before the third leg, [...] "Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World" [...] was also rehearsed.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex Courtes and Martin Fougerol. Shot at General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia on 27April 2005, the video included additional footage from the band's Vertigo Tour concert of 28April. Planning for the project began as soon as U2 became aware the arena was available (a result of the NHL lockout of 2004–2005). Manager Paul McGuinness believed selecting Vancouver as the filming location {{made a lot of}} sense, saying, [...] "t's a world-renowned production centre. We knew we'd {{be able to get the}} crews and camera people and equipment here." [...] Members of the public were invited to be part of the video via radio and internet announcements. Word of the shoot leaked before the official announcement, which led to fans lining up outside for the entire day. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were allowed in for the filming. During the shoot, U2 performed [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] multiple times, followed by [...] "Vertigo," [...] "All Because of You" [...] and [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make <b>It</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Own." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking in 2000 {{about this}} first session, Harrison {{said that the}} music sounded [...] "really nice" [...] in the room, [...] "with all these nice {{acoustics}} and piano, and no echo on anything", but he was shocked during the playback when he heard how Spector had recorded the track. In Leng's words, Spector [...] " [...] his full armory of reverb-flooded production values" [...] on [...] "Wah-Wah". Harrison dismissed the result as [...] "horrible", and recalled that when Clapton said he liked the way it sounded, he replied, [...] "Well, you can have <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> album, then." [...] Although Harrison said [...] "I grew to like it", he subsequently reverted to his original opinion that the song, like much of All Things Must Pass, was overproduced. Overdubs {{on many of the}} album's basic tracks were carried out at either Abbey Road or Trident Studios, without Spector's assistance, and completed by 12 August. After receiving Harrison's initial mixes, Spector wrote back with suggestions for each song; in the case of [...] "Wah-Wah", these included the addition of a saxophone solo by Keys, and backing vocals. As well as overdubbing his slide guitar solos, Harrison sang all the various vocal parts, crediting himself as [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers" [...] on the album sleeve.|$|E

"One Tree Hill" [...] {{was absent}} during the {{majority}} of the Zoo TV Tour, only appearing as an extended snippet at the end of [...] "One" [...] at both concerts in New Zealand in 1993. It did not appear again until 24November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the Vertigo Tour. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer Willie Williams voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990. The song was performed before [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make <b>It</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Own" [...] in the main set instead. U2 performed it an additional three times on the tour. [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] was absent for {{the majority of}} the U2 360° Tour but was revived in November 2010 for two concerts in New Zealand, where it was dedicated to the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster; their names were displayed on the video screen during the song. Dedicating the song, Bono said, [...] "we wrote it for Greg Carroll, whose family are with us tonight. But tonight it belongs to the miners of the West Coast Pike River." [...] U2 played [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] on 25March 2011, in Santiago, Chile, in a duet with Francisca Valenzuela, and they dedicated it to Victor Jara.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, U2 {{received}} five additional Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make <b>It</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Own", and Best Rock Album and Album of the Year for How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb; {{the awards}} made the album and its singles winners in all eight categories in which U2 were nominated, spanning two separate Grammy ceremonies. The group resumed the Vertigo Tour that month with a Latin American leg, on which several shows were filmed for the concert film U2 3D. It {{would be released}} in theatres nearly two years later, and was the world's first live-action digital 3-D film. In March, the band postponed the tour's remaining shows {{until the end of}} the year due to the health of the Edge's daughter. On 25 September 2006, U2 and Green Day performed at the Louisiana Superdome prior to an NFL football game, the New Orleans Saints' first home game in the city since Hurricane Katrina. The two bands covered the Skids' song [...] "The Saints Are Coming" [...] during the performance and for a benefit single, which reached number one in Australia and throughout Europe. U2 issued an official autobiography, U2 by U2, that month, followed in November by their third compilation album, U218 Singles. The Vertigo Tour concluded in December, having sold 4.6million tickets and having earned US$389million, the second-highest gross ever at the time.|$|E

500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you don’t get <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own. If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E
