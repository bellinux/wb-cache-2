5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} {{was within}} the village of Ardekul in South Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan. The village is isolated between mountains and hills. Although the Iranian government had distributed more than 800 seismographs throughout the country, few {{had been placed in}} the Qayen region due to its <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> and the remoteness of the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the city is {{monitored}} by the Pakistan Meteorological Department. The Pakistan Meteorological Department regularly provides forecasts, public warnings and rainfall information to farmers {{with the assistance of}} the National Agromet Centre. Faisalabad has been classified as a hot <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> (BWh) by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E
50|$|Cold <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> (BWk) usually feature hot (or warm {{in a few}} instances), dry summers, though summers {{typically}} are not quite as hot as summers in hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates.</b> Unlike hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates,</b> cold <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> tend to feature cold, dry winters. Snow tends to be rare in regions with this <b>climate.</b> The Gobi <b>Desert</b> in Mongolia {{is a classic example}} of this. Though hot in the summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. Cold <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> are typically found at higher altitudes than hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates,</b> and are usually drier than hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> (BWh) are {{typically}} found under the subtropical ridge {{where there is}} largely unbroken sunshine for the whole year due to the stable descending air and high pressure aloft. These areas are located between 30 degrees south and 30 degrees north latitude, under the subtropical latitudes called the horse latitudes. Hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> are generally hot, sunny and dry year-round. They rise at a higher latitude in south-western United States in the sheltered regions warmed up in winters by the Pacific Ocean, enabling searing summer temperatures in the Death Valley basin at 36 degrees latitude. Hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> also reach similar latitudes in the Middle East, North Africa and coastal south eastern areas of Spain. Part of the Canary Islands (specially most of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) have hot <b>desert</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mild <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> are characterised by more {{moderate}} temperatures than encountered elsewhere at comparable latitudes (usually {{due to the}} nearby presence of cold ocean currents) and, {{in the case of}} coastal mild deserts, frequent fog and low clouds, despite the fact that these places can rank among the driest on Earth in terms of actual precipitation received. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, usually not subject to any of the temperature extremes typically found in <b>desert</b> <b>climates.</b> Some publications do not have a [...] "mild desert" [...] category; in these documents mild <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> are sorted into either the hot desert or cold desert classifications.|$|R
5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy <b>desert</b> <b>climate.</b> In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{watershed}} {{includes a}} diversity of vegetation zones both past and present. A majority of the watershed was once covered with shrub-steppe grassland, most common in the Snake River Plain and also the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington. Riparian zones, wetlands and marshes once occurred {{along the length of}} the Snake River and its tributaries. In higher elevations, conifer forests, of which ponderosa pine is most common, dominate the landscape. The basin ranges from semi-desert to alpine climates, providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants. In the lowermost part of the watershed, in southeastern Washington, the Snake River is surrounded by an area called the Columbia Plateau Ecoprovince, which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms. The rest of the Plateau area is characterized by low hills, dry lakes, and an arid, nearly <b>desert</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sustainment Brigade and its {{soldiers}} {{have been the subject}} of numerous army publications during its tours in Iraq, most of which having to do with the culture and lifestyle of soldiers serving the unit. Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue. This story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story was written for defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E

5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a <b>desert</b> <b>climate.</b> Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E

25|$|Damascus has a cold <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> (BWk) in Köppen-Geiger system, due to {{the rain}} shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon {{mountains}} and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are dry and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Annual rainfall is around , occurring from October to May.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is {{generally}} low, with {{the winter months}} receiving very little. Sunshine is abundant throughout the year, with an annual total of nearly 3470, or 78% of the possible total.

25|$|With east Kimberley cattlemen keen {{to find a}} way to {{get their}} cattle to market, and the Government of Western Australia keen for {{competition}} to bring prices down, a 1905 proposal of a stock route through the desert was taken seriously. James Isdell, an east Kimberley pastoralist and member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, proposed the stock route arguing that ticks would not survive in the dry <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> on the trip south.|$|E

25|$|During April 1941, the C.200s of 374° Squadriglia {{became the}} first unit to be {{stationed}} on the North African mainland. Further units, including 153° Gruppo and 157° Gruppo, were stationed on the mainland as Allied air {{power in the region}} increased in capability and numbers, such as the Hurricane and the P-40 Warhawk. According to Cattaneo, the C.200 performed well under the conditions of the <b>desert</b> <b>climate,</b> particularly due to its high structural strength and short takeoff run.|$|E
25|$|Over half of New South Wales has an arid or {{semi-arid}} climate. However, {{the eastern}} portion has a temperate climate, ranging from humid subtropical to the Central Coast {{and most of}} Sydney, and oceanic to the south coast. The Snowy Mountains region in the south-east falls in the alpine climate/highland climate zone, with cool to cold weather all year around and snowfalls in the winter. Further inland, the climate gets semi-arid and a <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> towards {{the western part of}} the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} {{tropical}} and desertic, moderated {{by the sea}} and in summer by the trade winds. There {{are a number of}} microclimates and the classifications range mainly from semi-arid to desert. According to the Köppen climate classification, the majority of the Canary Islands have a hot <b>desert</b> <b>climate</b> represented as BWh. There also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean {{in the middle of the}} islands of La Gomera, Tenerife and La Palma; where the laurisilva forests grow.|$|E
50|$|Light shelves {{may not be}} {{suitable}} for all climates. They are generally used in mild climates and not in tropical or <b>desert</b> <b>climates</b> due to the intense solar heat gain.
