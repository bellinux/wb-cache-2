5|$|<b>Foresight</b> {{was ordered}} on 17 March 1933 from Cammell Laird and was laid down at their Birkenhead {{shipyard}} on 31 July, launched on 29 June 1934, and completed on 15 May 1935. The ship cost 245,428 pounds, excluding government-furnished {{equipment such as}} the armament. All of the F-class destroyers {{were assigned to the}} 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, and, <b>Foresight,</b> unlike her sisters, did not leave home waters during the 1930s. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, and <b>Foresight</b> remained assigned to it until July 1940. World War II began in September and she was tasked to escort the larger ships of the fleet during this time. She played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Foresight</b> {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet upon completion. Unlike her sister ships, she {{does not appear to have}} been attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis, nor did she enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. <b>Foresight</b> was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar. The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1941 and Arctic convoys during 1942. Later that year, <b>Foresight</b> participated in Operation Pedestal, another convoy to Malta. She was torpedoed by an Italian aircraft on 12 August and had to be scuttled the next day.|$|E

It identifies the main barriers preventing small firms from responding to the challenge of sustainability. The potential synergy between <b>foresighting</b> and small firms is outlined and a discussion of the literature linking <b>foresighting</b> methods and sustainability is presented. Sustainability is also compared with <b>foresighting</b> methods in order to identify complementary characteristics and the methodological underpinnings of <b>foresighting</b> is distinguished from different potential uses and interpretation of the methods. Finally, the paper assesses the utility of <b>foresighting</b> methods in the context of research on small firms and sustainability...|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{levelling}} are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (Double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two <b>foresights</b> and two backsights and makes sure {{the difference between}} the <b>foresights</b> and {{the difference between the}} backsights are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error. Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.|$|R
30|$|It {{goes without}} saying that for a {{classification}} of <b>foresighting</b> as scientific discipline, the complete process has to be considered.

5|$|In 2003 Malcolm listed 160 men {{killed on}} Eagle, 132 on Manchester, 52 on Nigeria, 50 on Indomitable, 24 on Cairo, 5 on <b>Foresight,</b> 3 on Kenya. Merchant Navy {{casualties}} were 83 on Waimarama, 18 on Clan Ferguson, 7 on Glenorchy, 5 on Melbourne Star, 4 on Santa Elisa, 1 on Deucalion, 1 on Ohio and 1 on Brisbane Star. In 2010, Vego wrote that about 350 {{men had been}} killed, Ohio never sailed again and the British lost one carrier (Eagle), two cruisers (Manchester and Cairo) and the destroyer <b>Foresight.</b> One carrier (Indomitable), two cruisers (Nigeria and Kenya) and three destroyers were damaged and under repair for some time. Two Italian cruisers (Bolzano and Muzio Attendolo) were damaged and not operational {{for the rest of}} the war, the Italian submarines Cobalto and Dagabur were sunk, the Italian submarine Giada and the German E-Boat S58 were damaged.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, <b>foresight</b> and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and <b>foresight</b> to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance. As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} was a fair target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released from the Tower of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies.

30|$|We {{often say}} that <b>foresights</b> are about thinking, debating and shaping the future [23, 24]. We {{requested}} the experts to engage mostly into the thinking and debating stages of <b>foresighting.</b> It is apparently easier {{to think and}} debate the future than to shape it, but does this imply that our anticipation of how to shape the future contains more uncertainty the longer the time perspective? Arguably, the nearer the future, the easier {{it will be to}} shape it, so the action space is wider a month from now than it is perceived to be in 2030 +. At least, that could serve as a hypothesis.|$|R
30|$|In March’s seminal article Exploration and {{exploitation}} in organizational learning [7], March examines problems regarding the balancing of resources {{allocated to the}} exploration of new possibilities with those allocated to exploitation of what is already known. With his model as our outset, we wanted to learn whether (and eventually how) the balance between exploration {{and exploitation}} in organizational learning {{could be used as}} a <b>foresighting</b> tool. The aim was to reflect upon and possibly gain insight about how universities in Europe might expect their mutual learning to develop under different conditions. The borders of the EHEA was seen as the natural limits for this <b>foresighting</b> endeavour.|$|R

5|$|Raleigh {{appointed}} Burrough as his vice-admiral and {{was joined}} in commission with Frobisher, who had knowledge of maritime affairs. George Clifford, the Earl of Cumberland {{had the largest}} stake in the expedition and helped Raleigh to finance and gather the fleet. The majority of the fleet were owned by investors; the ship Dainty for example was owned by John Hawkins, but was captained by John Norton. The fleet included notables such as William Monson, Robert Crosse, captain of the <b>Foresight,</b> Samuel Purchas, Richard Hawkins and Christopher Newport, captain of the Golden Dragon.|$|E
5|$|The English {{hoped to}} avoid sinking their {{opponent}} {{and to prevent}} her from running aground. The damage on Madre de Deus's defences was becoming serious. With her bow rigging all but disabled, Burrough sent Roebuck which then crashed into Madre de Deus, followed by <b>Foresight.</b> Both moved directly under her main guns. The English boarded her in the dark at 10 pm. Golden Dragon, Sampson and Tiger and the repaired Dainty came up in support. The English took the ship after a bloody hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Traffic {{patterns}} quickly {{shifted to}} take advantage of the new crossing and the bypass of Niagara Falls that it provided. In <b>foresight</b> of this, the Department of Public Highways took control of a Welland County road between Chambers Corners and Fort Erie on May11, 1927. This roadway, which followed a significant portion of Sherk's Road and the Garrison Road, in addition to a concession road built west from Port Colborne and north through Wainfleet village, was designated as Highway3A.|$|E

30|$|The first and, probably, most {{important}} step of <b>foresighting</b> is—like in any scientific work—to properly define {{the problem in}} regard. Often, posing the right question already delivers {{the better part of}} the solution or, at least, shows a feasible way to derive answers.|$|R

5|$|With the news, the English ships {{waited and}} raided the villages on Corvo for supplies. For {{the month of}} July the English ships formed a picket line spaced about six miles apart along a north/south axis. From the {{southern}} flank near Flores Island, the order of ships was Dainty, Golden Dragon, Roebuck, Tiger, Sampson, Prudence and <b>Foresight.</b> The Spanish fleet, which had been sighted briefly, seemed no longer a threat; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation: he disobeyed orders and headed further west, allowing the English to first reach the area of interception.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was <b>foresight.</b> He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|For {{exceptionally}} meritorious {{conduct in}} the performance of outstanding service while serving on board the U.S.S. TRITON from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960. As Commanding Officer, Captain Edward L. Beach, United States Navy, led his crew with courage, <b>foresight</b> and determination in an unprecedented circumnavigation of the globe, proving man's ability under trying conditions to accomplish prolonged submerged missions as well as testing new and complex equipment in the world's largest submarine. This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown conditions, as a result, the TRITON collected much valuable oceanographic information. Captain Beach's sound judgment, masterful leadership, professional skill and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.|$|E

Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by <b>Foresight</b> and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E

The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the <b>foresight</b> of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished.
