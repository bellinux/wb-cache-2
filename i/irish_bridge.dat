It is located along the Strode Brook tributary of the River Chew, on the northwest side of the Chew Valley Lake. While much of the area has been cleared for farming, trees line the tributary and many of the roads. The village is built along the main thoroughfare, Bristol Road, which runs northeast to southwest. An older centre is located along Pilgrims Way, which loops onto Bristol Road and features an old stone packhorse bridge—now pedestrianised—and a 1950s <b>Irish</b> <b>bridge,</b> used as a ford in winter. The bridge is [...] wide and has [...] parapets. Houses line both of these roads, with residential cul-de-sacs and lanes extending from them.|$|E

5000|$|Bandon ( [...] ; [...] ) {{is a town}} in County Cork, Ireland. It lies on the River Bandon {{between two}} hills. The name in <b>Irish</b> means <b>Bridge</b> of the Bandon, a {{reference}} to the origin of the town as a crossing-point on the river. In 2004 Bandon celebrated its quatercentenary. The town, sometimes called the Gateway to West Cork, had a population of 6,640 at the 2011 census.|$|R
50|$|<b>Irish</b> Bend Covered <b>Bridge</b> is a {{pedestrian}} bridge that spans Oak Creek on university property. Originally a bridge over Willamette Slough near Monroe, it {{was moved to}} Oak Creek in 1989. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Irish</b> Bend Covered <b>Bridge</b> is {{a wooden}} covered bridge near Corvallis, Oregon, United States. It was {{constructed}} in 1954 and originally spanned the Willamette Slough on Irish Bend Road near Monroe. However, in 1975 Irish Bend Road was realigned and the bridge fell {{into a state of}} disrepair. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It was eventually dismantled in 1988 {{to make way for a}} more modern concrete span. Through negotiations with Benton County and Oregon State University (OSU), an agreement was reached to reconstruct the bridge on university property. $30,000 was raised by the Irish Bend Advisory Committee, and Benton County provided an additional $30,000 to fund the project, which was completed in 1989. [...] Due to the relocation, the bridge was removed from the National Register in 1989. It was relisted in 2013.|$|R

50|$|A {{low-water}} crossing (also {{known as}} an <b>Irish</b> <b>bridge,</b> causeway in Australia, low-level crossing or low-water bridge) provides a bridge when water flow is low. Under high-flow conditions, water runs over the roadway and precludes vehicular traffic. This approach is cheaper than building a bridge to {{raise the level of}} the road above the highest flood stage of a river, particularly in developing countries or in semi-arid areas with rare high-volume rain. Low-water crossings can be dangerous when flooded.|$|E

5000|$|On 22 May 1940, Held′s {{house was}} raided and {{equipment}} brought by Görtz to Ireland including his parachute and Plan Kathleen were seized. The Garda waited for Held {{to arrive at}} the house and arrested him. They also found, in Görtz′s room, a typewriter and a file that contained military details about <b>Irish</b> harbours, airfields, <b>bridges,</b> roads, landing places, and the distribution of Irish Defence Forces. Around the same time, wife of Francis Stuart, Iseult Stuart (daughter of Maud Gonne) was arrested on suspicion of also harbouring [...] "Heinrich Brandy", the name Görtz was travelling under. Plan Kathleen was blown, and the Irish authorities immediately sent it to MI5 in London who sent it to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Belfast. The details of the plan were to form the nucleus of joint Irish and British wargaming the following year, under the auspices of Plan W — the combined response to a German invasion.|$|R
50|$|Because Limerick {{was very}} well fortified, Ireton did not risk an assault on its walls. Instead he secured the {{approaches}} to the city, cut off its supplies and built artillery earthworks to bombard the defenders. His troops took the fort at Thomond <b>bridge,</b> but the <b>Irish</b> destroyed the <b>bridge</b> itself, denying the Parliamentarians land access to English town. Ireton then tried an amphibious attack on the city, a storming party attacking the city in small boats. They were initially successful, but O’Neill’s men counterattacked and beat them off. After this attack failed, Ireton resolved to starve the city into submission and built two forts known as Ireton’s fort and Cromwell’s fort on nearby Singland Hill. An Irish attempt to relieve the city from the south was routed {{at the battle of}} Knocknaclashy. O’Neill’s only hope was now to hold out until bad weather and hunger forced Ireton to raise the siege. To this end, O’Neill tried to send the town’s old men, women and children out of the city so that his supplies would last a little longer. However, Ireton’s men killed 40 of these civilians and sent the rest back into Limerick.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1801 and 1803, {{the town}} and {{waterway}} were protected by temporary batteries at Hakin Point and south of St Katherine's Church, {{in response to the}} perceived threat following the Fishguard Invasion. In 1814 the Royal Dockyard was transferred to Pembroke Dock, which quickly reduced the fortunes of the new town. John Bartholomew commented in 1887 that Milford was in a languishing state, although he noted that the commercial docks, at that time under construction, [...] "will probably become a great seat of trade with America." [...] Robert Fulke Greville inherited the estate in 1824, and in 1853 relocated to the town. He commenced a series of improvements, including the building of a wooden pier and hotel for the <b>Irish</b> traffic, two <b>bridges</b> across Milford's two pills (accompanied by toll houses) and obtaining an Improvement Act for the town. [...] The town's population was further boosted by Quaker whalers from Nantucket, and a growing fishing industry that employed a large number of people. By 1849, the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building, with approximately 200 [...] "shipwrights residing at that place". The Milford Docks Act 1874 authorised the construction of a docks in Hubberston Pill, a plan which was estimated to require {{two and a half years}} before completion. Actual completion was not achieved until 1888, delayed in part due to the bankruptcy of Samuel Lake. Contemporary speculation suggested that a journey between London and New York via Milford would now be possible in less than seven days, two days fewer than the voyage on the established Liverpool route. There was also considerable thought given to a proposed [...] "Montreal & Milford Line", linking the two ports and potentially cutting the journey time even further than that of New York. It was eventually finished in 1888, but the transatlantic trade hoped for never materialized. Instead, the newly completed dockyard became the home of a sprawling fishing industry. By 1906, Milford had become the sixth largest fishing port in the UK, and in contrast to the general decline in Pembrokeshire's economy and a migration towards the South Wales Coal fields during the 1880s, its population rose. The Pembrokeshire Herald claimed in 1912 that [...] "the fish trade is Milford's sole industry....the population of the town has doubled by means of it". In 1863, the railway network came to Milford, linking it to the Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was completed on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and mining depot on the eastern side of the town. [...] If the Manchester and Milford Railway scheme had come to fruition, the town would have enjoyed a direct rail link to the Midlands and Northwest England.|$|R
