40|$|Mechanosensitive Ion {{channels}} {{are essential for}} maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been proposed that they function as osmotically activated <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> guarding against membrane rupture by opening pores to release excessive turgor pressure. Interfering with their function suggests many novel mechanisms to complement conventional antimicrobials to kill or inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens. Typical of this class of mechanosensitive channel are the large conduction homopentameric bacterial channel, MscL (MW∼ 17 kDa) and the small conduction homoheptameric bacterial channel, MscS (∼ 37 kDa) ...|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the MscL pore expands to ~30Å in {{diameter}} when closed, with change of 15-16Å upon opening, which is the largest known conformational change in channel proteins. This large change accounts for the opening of the 30Å diameter pore, resulting in a 20 nm2 in-plane protein expansion. Such a transformation is responsible for MscL's unitary conductance of 3nS and the channel's lack of selectivity, allowing any particles with a molecular weight smaller than ~1,000. This property of MscL fulfills its role as an <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> to release solutes under osmotic shock.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a signal}} fails to clear, {{depending}} on the area, there are three different ways to rectify the situation. On home signals, and station timed signals transit control can perform a [...] "call-on" [...] where an orange aspect blinks and the trip arm is released even when the aspect displayed is red. The second option is a [...] "key-by". Some signals have a plunger that the operator can stop, reach out the window, operate the plunger dropping the trip arm and then operate the train to a less restrictive signal. Where neither of these options exist, {{the only way to}} get past a defective signal is to [...] "trip through". The operator at slow speed must trip the signal (which in turn trips the train and places it into emergency). The crew must then reset the <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> (by going out the front door of the train) before proceeding.|$|E
5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. Emergency brake valves were (and still are) always located on the bulkheads (end walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency brake valve is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Optimal {{timing of}} {{surgical}} treatment for infective endocarditis (IE) complicated by intracranial hemorrhage remains controversial. Presentation of case: A 43 -year-old man with IE received appropriate antibiotic therapy but had recurrence of cerebral infarction and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). <b>Emergency</b> <b>valve</b> surgery was performed 2  days after ICH onset because {{of heart failure}} and recurrence of cerebral complications. Postoperatively, he showed no neurologic symptoms; neuroimaging showed no enlargement of ICH. Discussion: Postoperative risk of neurologic deterioration may be relatively lower than previously thought in patients with IE who undergo surgery within 1 month after ICH onset. Conclusions: Emergency surgery in patients with ICH is justified in cases of multiple indications for such small ICH. Further evaluation regarding the risk of subsequent hemorrhage in patients with ICH who require <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> surgery is warranted...|$|E

50|$|Each of {{the four}} {{turbines}} is an English Electric Company multi-cylinder impulse reaction machine operating on a single re-heat cycle with terminal steam connections of 158.6 bar (2,300 lbf/in2), 566 degrees Celsius (1051 degrees Fahrenheit) and exhausting at a back pressure of 1.5 in Hg. Steam from the boiler passes through four strainers and two pairs of combines stop and <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> each pair being associated with two throttle valves which regulate admission of steam to the H.P. cylinder inlet belt. The H.P. cylinder comprises eight stages in total. The steam expands through the first five stages towards the governor end and then re-versus its direction and flows between {{the inner and outer}} case to the last three stages. Reversing the steam flow within the H.P. cylinder helps to balance the thrust thus relieving the load on the single thrust bearing. From the H.P. cylinder the steam is fed to the boiler re-heater and returned to the I.P. cylinder through two strainers and two pairs of I.P. <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> each pair of which is associated with a pair of interceptor valves which are attached to the cylinder. The I.P. section of the turbine is double flow with seven stages to each flow. The exhaust steam from the I.P. cylinder is passed to the three L.P. cylinders by cross-over pipes reducing cross sections, which distribute the flow of steam equally to each L.P. cylinder through which it expands to the condenser. Each cylinder is double flow with five stages to each flow. A special feature of the Cottam machines is the radial condenser in which the tube nests are disposed right round the turbine L.P. shafts in a common casing. This reduces the steam velocity in the exhaust space, which together with the reduced losses in the exhaust duct improves the efficiency of the condenser. The weight of the whole structure is some hundreds of tons less than earlier structures, and the foundation block is also greatly simplified, since only a rudimentary structure above basement floor level is necessary under the L.P. turbine.|$|R

40|$|Bacterial mechano-sensitive (MS) {{channels}} {{reside in}} the inner membrane and are considered to act as <b>emergency</b> <b>valves</b> whose role is to lower cell turgor when bacteria enter hypo-osmotic environments. However, there is emerging evidence {{that members of the}} Mechano-sensitive channel Small (MscS) family play additional roles in bacterial and plant cell physiology. MscS has a large cytoplasmic C-terminal region that changes its shape upon activation and inactivation of the channel. Our pull-down and co-sedimentation assays show that this domain interacts with FtsZ, a bacterial tubulin-like protein. We identify point mutations in the MscS C-terminal domain that reduce binding to FtsZ and show that bacteria expressing these mutants are compromised in growth on sublethal concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics. Our results suggest that interaction between MscS and FtsZ could occur upon inactivation and/or opening of the channel and could be important for the bacterial cell response against sustained stress upon stationary phase and in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} mortality {{were studied}} in 92 consecutive cases of infective endocarditis admitted to two district general hospitals between January 1975 and April 1982.

40|$|The large {{conductance}} mechanosensitive channel (MscL), {{acts as an}} osmoprotective <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> in bacteria {{by opening}} a large, water-filled pore in response to changes in membrane tension. In its closed configuration, the last 36 residues at the C-terminus form a bundle of five α-helices co-linear with the five-fold axis of symmetry. Here, we examined the structural dynamics of the C-terminus of EcMscL using site-directed spin labelling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL EPR) spectroscopy. These experiments were complemented with computational modelling including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finite element (FE) modelling. Our results show that under physiological conditions, the C-terminus is indeed an α-helical bundle, located near the five-fold symmetry axis of the molecule. Both experiments and computational modelling demonstrate that only the top part of the C-terminal domain (from the residue A 110 to E 118) dissociates during the channel gating, {{while the rest of}} the C-terminus stays assembled.
