5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle {{was not interested in}} the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{testimony}} {{focused on}} the theory that Tim Farrar, angry at his father, had set fire to the home. Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or {{its place in the}} surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E

Terrence Malick credits seeing De Palma's early films on college campus tours as a validation of independent film, and subsequently switched his attention from philosophy to filmmaking. Other filmmakers influenced by De Palma include Quentin Tarantino, Ronny Yu, Don Mancini, Nacho Vigalondo, and Jack Thomas Smith.|$|E
25|$|Semenov was a Transbaikalian Cossack – {{dark and}} thickset, {{and of the}} rather alert Mongolian type.

Though capable and ingenious, he had received no education, and his outlook was narrow. I {{have never been able to}} understand how he came to play a leading role.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s, new {{problems}} such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution {{that could not be}} solved by normal hierarchical systems had arrived. Jay Forrester stated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to solve this problem. He applied systems theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model, which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth in order to maintain a steady equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Reeve was a {{licensed}} pilot and flew solo across the Atlantic twice. During {{the filming of}} Superman III, he raced his sailplane in his free time. He joined The Tiger Club, a group of aviators who {{had served in the}} Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain. They let him participate in mock dogfights in vintage World War I combat planes. The producers of the film The Aviator approached him without knowing that he was a pilot and that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to fly a Stearman, the plane used in the film. Reeve readily accepted the role. The film was shot in Kranjska Gora, and Reeve did all of his stunts. At this time, Gae Exton gave birth to their second child, Alexandra Exton Reeve, in December 1983 at Welbeck Hospital in London, England.|$|E
25|$|Flaccus was a {{perceptive}} politician, {{who looked}} for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> much courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He {{also knew that}} distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, {{the only way to}} the magisterial honors was success in the Roman Forum. For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the fruitful field of Roman politics. The advice was keenly followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.|$|E

25|$|When Sir John Lubbock {{was doing}} the {{preliminary}} work for his 1865 magnum opus, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were jointly publishing their first papers On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. Darwins's On the Origin of Species came out in 1859, {{but he did not}} elucidate the theory of evolution as it applies to man until the Descent of Man in 1871. Meanwhile, Wallace read a paper in 1864 to the Anthropological Society of London that was a major influence on Sir John, publishing in the very next year. He quoted Wallace:From the moment when the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, the first seed sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of the world's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe,—a being who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance in mind.|$|E
