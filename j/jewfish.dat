2500|$|Three mines were laid, each of 50lb., {{and were}} {{successfully}} fired. Amass {{of the wreckage}} was thrown to a great height, the vessel's mainmast also coming up. An immense volume of water was thrown into the air, and, after matters had subsided, it was seen that vast numbers of fish of all sizes and descriptions were floating on the surface. A grand haul {{was made by the}} boats on the spot one of the largest fish picked up, familiarly known as a <b>jewfish,</b> was found to measure 7ft. in length. It is intended to send the divers down at daylight today, and as the mines were so placed as to blow the bottom out of the schooner, and so release the topsides and the deck, the hull should now be readily floated. The work was carried out solely by the Naval Brigade gunroom officer assisted by a few certificated men of the force, {{under the direction of the}} gunnery and torpedo instructors, Messrs.

50|$|The {{deep sea}} {{resources}} remain comparatively unexploited because local vessels are neither suitable nor equipped for deep-water fishery. The idea has motivated entrepreneurs to augment their deep-sea fishing craft {{for use of}} the resources. Small-scale benthic or demersal fishery is most common in coastal inshore waters. Fishermen use nylon gillnet, locally termed 'ruch', with a mesh of about 150 mm long. Benthic varieties include the marine <b>jewfish,</b> croakers, grunters, snappers, groupers, ribbonfish and pomfrets.|$|E

5000|$|The Atlantic goliath grouper {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the <b>jewfish.</b> The name's origin is unclear, and may have referred to the flesh having a [...] "clean" [...] taste comparable to kosher food, been an insulting suggestion that the fish provided low quality meat and was [...] "only fit for Jews", or that the word was simply a corruption of jawfish.

The upper ends of the Georges River are abundant with Bass during the summer months and during the winter months these bass migrate down to the lower ends of the river towards the salt water to breed. Waste water inflows to the river are carefully managed to maintain the estuarine habitat.|$|E

50|$|Key Largo is {{connected}} to the mainland in Miami-Dade County by two routes. The first route is The Overseas Highway, which is U.S. Highway 1 that enters Key Largo at <b>Jewfish</b> Creek near the middle of the island and turns southwest. The second route is Card Sound Road, which connects to the northern part of Key Largo at Card Sound Bridge and runs southeastward to connect with County Road 905, which runs southwest and joins U.S. 1 at about mile marker 106. These routes originate at Florida City on the mainland.|$|E
5000|$|Glaucosoma hebraicum, the Westralian <b>jewfish,</b> West Australian dhufish or West Australian pearl perch, is {{a species}} of fish in the family Glaucosomatidae, the pearl perches. It is native to the waters around Australia from Shark Bay, Western Australia, to the Archipelago of the Recherche at depths to 200 m. [...] This species can reach 122 cm in length, though most do not exceed 80 cm. The {{greatest}} recorded weight for this species is 26 kg. This species is important to local commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish.|$|E
50|$|At this time, the Overseas Highway only {{ran along}} the old {{railroad}} route in the middle keys; the original highway segments were still in use in {{the upper and lower}} keys. As the United States entered into World War II, the U.S. Navy sought improvements to the highway to improve their access from the Naval Air Station on Boca Chica Key to the mainland for national security purposes. The 1920s-era lower keys segment was less than ideal with its winding road and rickety wooden bridges. This resulted in completing the rest of the highway throughout the keys on the former railroad right of way, which the state already owned and was a more direct route with smoother curves that would allow for higher speeds. Also included in this project was the construction of the highway from Florida City to Key Largo via <b>Jewfish</b> Creek (known as the 18-Mile Stretch). The new alignments, which were officially completed on May 16, 1944, shortened the route to the mainland by 17 miles. The original Card Sound Bridge was closed after the <b>Jewfish</b> Creek alignment opened, and its remains were subsequently destroyed by a fire (the Card Sound route would be restored as a secondary route in 1969 {{with the opening of the}} current bridge). Today, some segments of the original highway remain as side and frontage roads for the current highway.|$|E
