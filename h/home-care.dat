25|$|In 2008, SEIU 775 sued Governor Chris Gregoire {{over her}} budget, {{claiming}} {{it failed to}} fund wage increases for state <b>home-care</b> workers. An arbitrator had ordered a 47-cents-per-hour wage increase over two years, following failed contract negotiations. The Washington Federation of State Employees had also sued Gregoire, alleging breach of contract for workers. The union clashed with Gregoire again in 2010 when she canceled several collective bargaining agreements and requested that state workers return to negotiations. Rolf claimed that health workers in the state would lose $100 million in overtime and benefits that had been ordered by an arbitrator.|$|E
500|$|Two of today's largest PR firms, Edelman and Burson-Marsteller, {{were founded}} in 1952 and 1953 respectively. Daniel Edelman {{created the first}} media tour in the 1950s by touring the country with [...] "the Toni Twins," [...] where one had used a {{professional}} salon and the other had used Toni's <b>home-care</b> products. It was also during this period that trade magazines like PR Week, Ragans and PRNews were founded. John Hill, founder of Hill & Knowlton, {{is known as the}} first international PR pioneer. Hill & Knowlton was the first major U.S. firm to create a strong international network in the 1960s and 1970s. Both Edelman and Burson-Marsteller followed Hill & Knowlton by establishing operations in London in the 1960s and all three began competing internationally in Asia, Europe and other regions. Jacques Coup de Frejac was influential in persuading U.S. and UK companies to also extend their PR efforts into the French market and for convincing French businesses to engage in PR activities.

40|$|AbstractAcute {{otitis media}} (AOM) {{is the most}} common disease {{requiring}} antibiotic treatment in young children. This article reviews the incidence of AOM in different age groups of controlled populations, its incidence in pediatricians, consulting rooms and emergency services and the main circumstances that usually complicate the diagnosis (circumstances of examination, methods and devices used and pediatric skills). Host and environmental factors related to otitis- prone children are revisited. Sex predominance (males), ethnicity, birth order (second-born or siblings), early occurrence of infection (when earlier, worse), and sibling history of severe or recurrent ear infections are host factors related to recurrent otitis. Season (inconclusive), socio-economic status (inconclusive) smoke and air pollutants (clearly related), breast-feeding (clearly related, especially when prolonged) and type of day care (the greatest incidence in children inlarge day-care groups versus <b>home-cared)</b> are environmental factors related to recurrent otitis...|$|R
40|$|Initiative (OSGi) and Smart card {{technologies}} in embedded devices {{have made the}} two technologies suitable for developing middleware applications for home appliances. In this paper, we describe an electronic-prescription (eRx) system currently under development for home-based telemedicine. The eRx system is intended to support a home cared patient {{who would like to}} order a refill of prescription by sending a request to the doctor via a home gateway without making direct phone call to the office. The design of the eRx system is based on the OSGi environment, which serves as the service framework between the home gateway (a set-top box) and the external wide area network that provides services to the home. The set-top box allows the patient to communicate to the doctor at the hospital or the pharmacist at the pharmacy stores. The system, if successfully deployed, will eliminate the waiting and frustration endured by <b>home-cared</b> patients, in particular those who are bed-ridden or not dexterous, for Rx order and refilling. The paper describes aspects or bundles in OSGi, which we are using, XML as a means of data storage format, smart card technology for storing and accessing patient prescription and personal information, and a wireless PDA interface for remote access to the home gateway (set-top box) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} members of the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Society {{confirmed}} high rates of psychological morbidity, though not of depres-sion, and social isolation in family carers of persons with dementia. Psychological morbidity in carers was associated with having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding problem behaviours, poor physical health in the carer, social isolation, dissatisfaction with social supports, greater use of psychotropic medication, and a deteriorated marital relationship. Carers and patients had high rates of consultations with doctors and other health professionals. There was a vulnerable group of carers who were impaired psychologically, socially and physically. The identification of risk factors to carer morbidity may lead to useful interventions. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry 1990; 24 : 351 - 361 Accompanying the greying of the Australian population there is a projected rise in the prevalence of dementia which is expected to be two to three times the general population growth rate [I]. On humane and socio-economic grounds {{it is important to consider}} how those affected by dementia will be cared for. Currently most sufferers are cared for at home and this is preferred by families [2]. Yet caring for dementia imposes significant burden on families [3] which, if excessive, may lead to breakdown of <b>home-caring</b> arrangements [4]. The distress that family carers experience can manifest itself psychologically, physically, socially and financially [5 - lo]. Psychological stress in par-ticular has been well documented in dementia carers...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{sub-project}} is {{to apply}} mechatronic and embedded control techniques to design and implement anthropomorphic dual arms of a wheeled mobile service robot with a four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile platform. This three-year research work {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part is devoted to constructing a sensor interfacing and processing module for fusing stereo vision camera, 3 D optical distance measurement device, six-axial force/moment sensors and textile sensors, and then establishing an intelligent position/vision/force coordination and cooperation approach to achieving visual servoing, position and force control, and position/vision/force control. The second part not only proposes methods for recognizing objects, finding grasping points, and proceeding with visual-guided grasping, but also constructs two dexterous hands for object handling, and several basic dual-arm cooperative skills, such as pick-and-place, opening a can, assembling, writing and etc., in order to carry out autonomous manipulations. Along with these aforementioned techniques, the third part is aimed to develop a brain-like task execution method by utilizing two fuzzy-neural networks to respectively mimic the visual data processing and cognition functions of visual cortex in animals' or human brains. All the proposed technologies and designed modules must be realistically implemented and verified on an experimental robot. Through experimental results, all the proposed technologies will be proven useful and effective not only in improving motion control, autonomous grasping and manipulations, perception and recognition of the current intelligent robots, but also in extending the applications of the proposed methods to perform complicated tasks in the fields of <b>home-caring,</b> edutainment, health-caring, restaurant servicing and manufacturing. 本計畫的目的是設計與製作輪型雙手臂行動服務機器人之仿人式靈巧的雙手臂及其嵌入式控制晶片。本子計畫將應用機電整合、智能控制與嵌入式控制晶片等技術，以三年的時間發展靈巧雙手臂之三大主要技術：第一項著重於結合彩色立體攝影機、 3 D光學距離量測器、六軸力/力矩感測器、觸覺等感測器，發展雙手臂系統的手眼力協調控制，依序達成手眼協調控制 (雙手臂之視覺伺服控制) ，手力協調控制(雙手臂之位置、軌跡與力/力矩控制) 以及手眼力協調控制(視覺導引的位置、軌跡與力/力矩控制) 等技術。第二項以運動平台、雙手臂與手指系統的手眼力協調控制為基礎，致力於發展物件辨識，抓取點選定，物件抓取等關鍵技術，接著探討雙手臂與手指系統的基本合作動作，如以雙手合作取物、開罐、組裝、書寫等，進而構成複雜動作與操作。第三部分是整合雙手臂系統的手眼力協調控制與自主抓取操作等技術，搭配四輪全方位移動平台，應用腦認知神經學與行為學的已知或新發現，以遞迴第二型態的模糊類神經網路，仿效學習視覺皮層(Visual Cortex) 與腦部影像認知的功能，研發自我組織的物件抓取與操作等功能，進而實現某種程度的自主任務執行。本計畫所開發的關鍵技術、嵌入式控制晶片與系統整合技術，可提昇雙手臂的智能控制，運動反應、操作技術、感知與認知；所研發的系統軟硬體建置與相關實務技術，不但有助於提升現今智慧機器人系統的製作生產技術，同時可推廣應用於家事、娛樂教育、健康照護，餐飲與製造等其他領域的智慧型機器人...|$|R
