5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} made a terrible mistake. Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by {{a letter from the}} Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{week after}} Cox's {{appointment}} as manager of Mansfield Town, Meikle <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Conference Premier club on 24 May 2011 after signing a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a 76th-minute substitute for Matt Green in a 1–1 home draw with Bath City on 13 August 2011. His first goal for the club was the 81st-minute winner in a 3–1 away win over Barrow, which came after he paced past two defenders before he calmly finished with a shot into the bottom corner. Meikle played a vital role in Mansfield reaching the play-offs in third place, playing in both semi-final matches against York City, which the team lost 2–1 on aggregate. He finished 2011–12 with 7 goals in 47 appearances and was offered a new contract by the club in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Matt tracks Bullseye, but is {{attacked}} by Elektra, {{who plans to}} use her own training in martial arts to avenge her father's death. She defeats and injures Matt; when she manages to remove his mask, she discovers Matt's secret identity and innocence. Forced to fight Bullseye alone, Elektra is overpowered and killed by the hitman. A wounded Matt {{makes his way to}} a church, where he is looked after by his confidante, Father Everett, who knows his secret identity. After recovering slightly, Matt fights Bullseye, who had <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church. Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Matt's weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked piece of wood after incapacitating him. Matt blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighboring building preparing to fire. As the bullet is fired, Matt moves out of the bullet's path and pulls Bullseye's hands into it. When Bullseye pleads for mercy, Matt throws him from the church's steeple. Bullseye lands on the hood of Urich's car, severely injured but alive.|$|E

25|$|The monster {{appeared}} as a foe to Marvel Comics' X-Men in issue #40 of their eponymous series (January 1968). In the story, written by Roy Thomas, the monster had various powers, including incredible strength, optic beams, and magnetized feet. He was an ambassador sent to Earth by aliens in the 1850s, but upon arrival, he went berserk. His fellow aliens <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Pole, where he was frozen.

They became lovers after arriving in Paris, where they socialized with Stein and Pablo Picasso before leaving for the Villa Curonia, where the guests included Arthur Rubinstein. At first this was a very happy time for the couple, but tensions grew between them as Reed became uncomfortable with the affluent isolation, and Dodge saw his interests in the world of people and achievements as a rejection of her. They returned to New York in late September, 1913. In October, Reed was sent to report on the Mexican Revolution by Metropolitan Magazine. Although Dodge <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border town of Presidio, she left after just a few days.|$|E
25|$|Opting to bat first, India {{got off to}} a poor start losing Virender Sehwag in {{the third}} over, after he scored three fours off Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Lokuhettige. The other opener Mahendra Singh Dhoni soon <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pavilion, and Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were to rebuild, from the score at 22/2. They played cautiously, yet the former gave away his wicket, pulling to {{substitute}} fielder Upul Tharanga at mid-on. More wickets followed in the form of debutante, Suresh Raina, who was trapped leg before wicket in his first ball in senior international cricket, by Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra, as India crumbled to 64/5. Dravid, however, played a reliable knock, and together with another debutante, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, added 58 in thirteen overs. However, it came to an end too early to help India significantly in the late overs, with leg-spinner Upul Chandana sneaking a ball past his bat and pads and having him bowled for 54, and India were staring at a very low score – 123/6 after 33 overs. Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan added 20 each, however, which coupled with Irfan Pathan's slow but steady 21, lifted India to a somewhat competitive score of 205/9 at the end of 50 overs.|$|E

500|$|Lody's conduct was contrasted favourably {{with the}} German spies {{captured}} after him, {{many of whom}} were nationals of neutral countries, who <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> execution chair.

Similarly, Thomson described [...] "the scum of neutral spies", of whom he said, [...] "we came to wish that a distinction could have been made between patriotic spies like Lody and the hirelings who pestered us through the ensuing years". Shortly after Lody's death he was described in the House of Commons as [...] "a patriot who had died for his country as much as any soldier who fell in the field." ...|$|E

[...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67.

Walsingham wrote an account of the mercy shown by the bishop to Litster during his execution: [...] "After hearing his confession and absolving him by virtue of his office, he <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallows, showing, although he had overcome him, a deed of kindness and piety, for he supported his head lest it should be bruised by the ground when he was being drawn to the hanging".|$|E
