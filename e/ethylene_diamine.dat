50|$|The {{internal}} cavity of a carcerand can be {{as large}} as 1700 Å3 (1.7 nm3) when six hemicarcerands form a single octahedral compound. This is accomplished by dynamic covalent chemistry in a one-pot condensation of 6 equivalents of a tetraformyl calixarene and 12 equivalents of <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> with trifluoroacetic acid catalyst in chloroform at room temperature followed by reduction of the imine bonds with sodium borohydride.|$|E
50|$|Diethylenetriamine (abbreviated DETA {{and also}} known as 2,2’-Iminodi(ethylamine)) is an organic {{compound}} with the formula HN(CH2CH2NH2)2. This colourless hygroscopic liquid is soluble in water and polar organic solvents, but not simple hydrocarbons. Diethylenetriamine is structural analogue of diethylene glycol. Its chemical properties resemble those for <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine,</b> and it has similar uses. It is a weak base and its aqueous solution is alkaline. DETA is a byproduct of the production of ethylenediamine from ethylene dichloride.|$|E

5000|$|Divergent {{synthesis}} {{refers to}} the sequential [...] "growth" [...] of a dendrimer layer by layer, starting with a core [...] "initiator" [...] molecule which contains functional groups capable of acting as active sites in the initial reaction. Each subsequent reaction in the series increases the number of available surface groups exponentially.

50|$|PLX, when mixed, is a {{transparent}} liquid with a yellowish tint. Both <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and nitromethane are very volatile, requiring the contents {{to be sealed}} if any storage is intended. Generally, for safety purposes, the contents are transported separately and mixed on site. PLX {{is known to have}} a velocity of detonation (VoD) of anywhere between 6,000 and 7,000 m/s, depending on diameter. Although greatly sensitized by the addition of EDA, PLX still requires a powerful blasting cap or a small booster charge to successfully detonate.|$|E
50|$|Piperazine is {{freely soluble}} in water and {{ethylene}} glycol, but insoluble in diethyl ether. It is a weak base with two pKbs of 5.35 and 9.73 at 25 °C.; the pH of a 10% aqueous solution of piperazine is 10.8-11.8. Piperazine readily absorbs water and carbon dioxide from the air. Although many piperazine derivatives occur naturally, piperazine itself can be synthesized by reacting alcoholic ammonia with 1,2-dichloroethane, {{by the action of}} sodium and ethylene glycol on <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> hydrochloride, or by reduction of pyrazine with sodium in ethanol.|$|E

Regular nucleophiles such as the fluoride anion, aniline, pyridine, <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and the phenolate ion were found to have pseudo first order reaction rates corresponding to their basicity as measured by their pKa. Other nucleophiles however reacted much faster than expected based on this criterion alone. These include hydrazine, hydroxylamine, the hypochlorite ion and the hydroperoxide anion.|$|E
50|$|The Zintl {{line is a}} {{hypothetical}} boundary drawn between group 13 and group 14, to highlight the tendency for group 13 metals to form phases {{with a variety of}} stoichiometries, which contrasts to group 14 and above that tend to form salts with polymeric anions. It is now recognised that some Zintl phases contain Zintl clusters and that this accounts for the variable stoichiometries. The bonding in many of these clusters cannot be accounted for by classical octet rule involving covalent, 2-centre, 2-electron bonds, as implied by the Zintl rule. The reaction of Ge, Sn or Pb and Na in liquid NH3 in the presence of <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> (en) gives the Zintl cluster Na4en7Sn9.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{anisotropic}} wet etchants {{are available}} for silicon, all of them hot aqueous caustics. For instance, potassium hydroxide (KOH) displays an etch rate selectivity 400 times higher in <100> [...] crystal directions than in <111> directions. EDP (an aqueous solution of <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and pyrocatechol), displays a <100>/<111> selectivity of 17X, does not etch silicon dioxide as KOH does, and also displays high selectivity between lightly doped and heavily boron-doped (p-type) silicon. Use of these etchants on wafers that already contain CMOS integrated circuits requires protecting the circuitry. KOH may introduce mobile potassium ions into silicon dioxide, and EDP is highly corrosive and carcinogenic, so care is required in their use. [...] Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) presents a safer alternative than EDP, with a 37X selectivity between {100} and {111} planes in silicon.|$|E
50|$|Ficoll {{is part of}} Ficoll-Paque, {{which is}} used in biology {{laboratories}} to separate blood to its components (erythrocytes, leukocytes etc.). Ficoll-Paque is normally placed {{at the bottom of}} a conical tube, and blood is then slowly layered above Ficoll-Paque. After being centrifuged, the following layers will be visible in the conical tube, from top to bottom: plasma and other constituents, a layer of mono-nuclear cells called buffy coat (PBMC/MNC), Ficoll-Paque, and erythrocytes & granulocytes which should be present in pellet form. This separation allows easy harvest of PBMCs. Note that some red blood cell trapping (presence of erythrocytes & granulocytes) may occur in the PBMC or Ficoll-Paque layer. Major blood clotting may sometimes occur in the PBMC layer. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> tetra-acetate (EDTA) and heparin are commonly used in conjunction with Ficoll-Paque(TM) to prevent clotting and is used as a mononuclear cell separator.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{chelator}} {{is derived}} from Greek chēlē, meaning [...] "claw". Chelators remove, through a complex formation, metals from looser chemical compounds in the organism, such as iron and lead. The most commonly used metal chelators in clinical toxicology include meso-2,3-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA, succimer), sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS, unithiol) and <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Diagnostically, a provocation test involves taking a urine test {{before and after the}} application of a chelating agent. The provocation test with DMPS has according to Geir Bjørklund been found to provide a reliable estimate of body burden mercury, safer than dimercaprol and more potent than DMSA. A provocation test with calcium EDTA can be used when the blood lead levels have returned to normal by the time a diagnosis of lead poisoning is attempted. In such situations, this provocation test can increase the urinary excretion of the stored lead.|$|E
5000|$|Consider the two equilibria, in aqueous solution, {{between the}} copper(II) ion, Cu2+ and {{ethylenediamine}} (en) {{on the one}} hand and methylamine, MeNH2 on the other.In [...] the bidentate ligand <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> forms a chelate complex with the copper ion. Chelation results in the formation of a five-membered ring. In [...] the bidentate ligand is replaced by two monodentate methylamine ligands of approximately the same donor power, meaning that the enthalpy of formation of Cu-N bonds is approximately the same in the two reactions. Under conditions of equal copper concentrations and when then concentration of methylamine is twice the concentration of ethylenediamine, the concentration of the complex [...] will be greater than the concentration of the complex [...] The effect increases with the number of chelate rings so the concentration of the EDTA complex, which has six chelate rings, is much higher than a corresponding complex with two monodentate nitrogen donor ligands and four monodentate carboxylate ligands. Thus, the phenomenon of the chelate effect is a firmly established empirical fact: under comparable conditions, the concentration of a chelate complex will be higher than the concentration of an analogous complex with monodentate ligands.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Zintl clusters=== Zintl {{compounds}} feature naked anionic clusters {{that are}} generated {{by reduction of}} heavy main group p elements, mostly metals or semimetals, with alkali metals, often as a solution in anhydrous liquid ammonia or ethylenediamine. Examples of Zintl anions are Bi33−, Sn94−, Pb94−, and Sb73−. Although these species are called [...] "naked clusters," [...] they are usually strongly associated with alkali metal cations. Some examples have been isolated using cryptate complexes of the alkali metal cation, e.g., Pb102− anion, which features a capped square antiprismatic shape. According to Wade's rules (2n+2) the number of cluster electrons is 22 and therefore a closo cluster. The compound is prepared from oxidation of K4Pb9 [...] by Au+ in PPh3AuCl (by reaction of tetrachloroauric acid and triphenylphosphine) in <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> with 2.2.2-crypt. This type of cluster was already known as is the endohedral Ni@Pb102− (the cage contains one nickel atom). The icosahedral tin cluster Sn122− or stannaspherene anion is another closed shell structure observed (but not isolated) with photoelectron spectroscopy. With an internal diameter of 6.1 Ångstrom, it is of comparable size to fullerene and should be capable of containing small atoms {{in the same manner as}} endohedral fullerenes, and indeed exists a Sn12 cluster that contains an Ir atom: Ir@Sn123−.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{presence}} of certain substances in a sample is known, the study of their absolute or relative abundance can help in determining specific properties. Knowing the composition of a sample is very important, and several ways {{have been developed to}} make it possible, like gravimetric and volumetric analysis. Gravimetric analysis yields more accurate data about the composition of a sample than volumetric analysis but also takes more time to perform in the laboratory. Volumetric analysis, on the other hand, doesn't take that much time and can produce satisfactory results. Volumetric analysis can be simply a titration based in a neutralization reaction {{but it can also be}} a precipitation or a complex forming reaction as well as a titration based in a redox reaction. However, each method in quantitative analysis has a general specification, in neutralization reactions, for example, the reaction that occurs is between an acid and a base, which yields a salt and water, hence the name neutralization. In the precipitation reactions the standard solution is in the most cases silver nitrate which is used as a reagent to react with the ions present in the sample and to form a high insoluble precipitate. Precipitation methods are often called simply as argentometry. In the two other methods the situation is the same. Complex forming titration is a reaction that occurs between metal ions and a standard solution that is in the most cases EDTA (<b>Ethylene</b> <b>Diamine</b> Tetra Acetic acid). In the redox titration that reaction is carried out between an oxidizing agent and a reduction agent.|$|E
5000|$|Polyamides (PA), high-performance, {{for severe}} environments; {{high-temperature}} glues; typically applied at over 200 °C, but can degrade and char during processing. In molten state can somewhat degrade by atmospheric oxygen. High application temperature. High range of service temperatures, generally showing adequate bonding from -40 to 70 °C; some compositions allow operation to 185 °C {{if they do}} not have to carry load. Resistant to plasticizers, therefore suitable for gluing polyvinyl chloride; only polyamides derived from secondary diamines however provide a satisfying bond. Resistant to oils and gasoline. Good adhesion to many substrates such as metal, wood, vinyl, ABS, and treated polyethylene and polypropylene. Some formulations are UL-approved for electrical applications requiring reduced flammability. Three groups are employed, with low, intermediate, and high molecular weight; the low MW ones are low-temperature melting and easy to apply, but have lower tensile strength, lower tensile-shear strength, and lower elongation than the high-MW ones. The high-MW ones require sophisticated extruders and are used as high-performance structural adhesives. The presence of hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains gives polyamides a high strength at even low molecular weights, in comparison with other polymers. Hydrogen bonds also provide retention of most of the adhesive strength up almost to the melting point; however they also make the material more susceptible to permeation of moisture in comparison with polyesters. Can be formulated as soft and tacky or as hard and rigid. Niche applications, together with polyesters taking less than 10% of total volume of hot melt adhesives market. Absorption of moisture may lead to foaming during application as water evaporates during melting, leaving voids in the adhesive layer which degrade mechanical strength. Polyamide HMAs are usually composed of a dimer acid with often two or more different diamines. The dimer acid usually presents 60-80% of the total polyamide mass, and provides amorphous nonpolar character. Linear aliphatic amines such as <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and hexamethylene diamine, provide hardness and strength. Longer chain amines such as dimer amine, reduce the amount of hydrogen bonds per volume of material, resulting in lower stiffness. Polyether diamines provide good low-temperature flexibility. Piperazine and similar diamines also reduce the number of hydrogen bonds. Only polyamides based on piperazine and similar secondary amines form satisfactory bond with polyvinyl chloride; primary amines form stronger hydrogen bonds within the adhesive, secondary amines can act only as proton acceptors, don't form hydrogen bonds within the polyamide, and are therefore free to form weaker bonds with vinyl, probably with the hydrogen atom adjacent to the chlorine.|$|E
