Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} met with {{positive}} reviews at its festival screenings. Jordan Hoffman, writing for UGO Networks, gave it a B+, compared it to Black Dynamite, and wrote that it [...] "is bursting with idiotic humor and in-your-face stoner wit". Eric Kohn of Indiewire also gave the film a B+, called it [...] "loud, furious and recklessly funny", and mentioned the references to The Warriors, RoboCop, and Escape from New York. Scott Weinberg of Twitch Film echoed Hoffman's comparison to Black Dynamite. Weinberg said he [...] "found quite a lot to enjoy" [...] and praised the performances of Hsu, Valmassy, and Trost. Jacob Hall of Moviefone gave the film a positive review, praising Brandon Trost's cinematography and mentioned its similarities to Mad Max 2 and A Clockwork Orange. He commended the film's dedication to its [...] "absolutely ludicrous premise" [...] and called it [...] "the rare 'ready-made cult hit' that actually works".

500|$|Freedom From Want had {{previously}} been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies {{of the western world}} than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be [...] "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of Karl Marx's [...] "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". [...] In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase [...] "The America we <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" [...] describes an egalitarian America. [...] In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as [...] "haunting and sharp" [...] against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state had an obligation to provide a basic level of subsistence. Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the New Deal had not already granted freedom from want as it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.|$|E

[...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future."

Prior to the first game's events, Nora takes <b>Hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a festival in Bodhum, and the two end up being selected for the Purge. When Snow and his group NORA free the refugees, Nora chooses to join their efforts. During an attack, Nora saves Snow from a missile attack but a counterattack leaves her gravely injured and she only has time {{to ask him to}} get her son home before she dies. When Hope, Lightning, and Fang arrive at Hope's house with a wounded Snow, Bartholomew allows them to take shelter there, managing to forgive Snow for failing to save Nora as he fulfilled her final wish to get Hope home. When the Cavalry help the four escape, Hope restrains his father, making him appear a victim and thus protecting him from Cocoon's authorities. After the fall of Cocoon, Bartholomew helps set up the provincial government {{after the fall of the}} Sanctum. He dies of natural causes some years later. A thousand years after Cocoon's fall, the spirits of Nora and Bartholomew appear to Hope after Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control. Nora is voiced by Komina Matsushita in Japanese and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in English, while Bartholomew is voiced by Masaki Aizawa in Japanese and André Sogliuzzo in English.|$|E
