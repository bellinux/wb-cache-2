It combines {{the techniques of}} finite state analysis and axiomatic verification. It overcomes the problem of state explosion by using variables and logical assertions where the finite state approach would require {{a large number of}} states. By explicitly including states where interactions between processes occur, the complexity of assertional proofs is significantly reduced. Properties like freedom from deadlock, freedom from unspecified message receptions, boundedness of channel size, and partial correctness can be proved. Properties of channels like losing or <b>garbling</b> <b>messages</b> can be modeled, as can premature and non-premature timeouts. The technique is illustrated by proving a sliding window flow control protocol and an alternating bit protocol that is correct only if timeouts are non-premature...|$|R

50|$|The {{main problem}} for TF 58 was {{locating}} the enemy, {{who had been}} operating at a great distance. Early-morning American searches on June 20 found nothing. An extra mid-day search flown by Hellcat fighter pilots also came back empty. Finally at 15:12 a <b>garbled</b> <b>message</b> from an Enterprise search plane indicated a sighting. At 15:40 the sighting was verified, along with distance, course, and speed. The Japanese fleet was 275 miles out, moving due west at a speed of 20 knots. The Japanese were at the limit of TF 58's strike range, and daylight was slipping away. Mitscher decided to launch an all-out strike. After the first attack group had launched, a third message arrived, indicating the Japanese fleet were 60 miles farther out than previously indicated. The first launch would be at their limits of fuel, {{and would have to}} attempt landing at night. Mitscher canceled the second launch of aircraft, but chose not to recall the first launch. Of the 240 planes that were launched for the strike, 14 aborted for various reasons and returned to their ships.

5000|$|The {{inscription}} {{on the wall}} is an interesting element in this painting.

[...] This last detail is essential {{as it relates to the}} question of why Belshazzar and his advisers were not able to decipher the inscription and had to send for Daniel to help them with it. The biblical story does not identify the language of the cryptic message, but it is generally assumed to be Aramaic, which, like Hebrew, is written in right-to-left rows, and not in right-to-left columns as in the painting. Although there is no accepted explanation why the Babylonian priests were unable to decipher the writing, the point of this unconventional arrangement - reading the text in the painting in the conventional row-wise left-to-right order results in a <b>garbled</b> <b>message</b> - may be to suggest why the text proved incomprehensible to the Babylonian wise men; indeed, this explanation is in accordance with the opinion of the amora Shmuel, which is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, 22 a, among various dissenting views.

50|$|For {{its first}} use in combat, during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, the Rogers train {{substituted}} a new telegraph instrument, the Beardslee Patent Magneto-Electric Field Telegraph Machine, invented by George W.

The Beardslee telegraph was housed in a wooden chest with handles and weighed about 100 pounds. It had two significant technical deficiencies, however. Its generator could not produce enough electricity to transmit signals more than about 5 to 8 miles. More seriously, there was a tendency for the sending and receiving index pointers to get out of synchronization, hopelessly <b>garbling</b> transmitted <b>messages.</b> Broken machines had to be sent back to New York City for repair.
