2500|$|Prescription, on {{the other}} hand, {{is an attempt to}} promote {{particular}} linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or [...] "acrolect". This may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> establishing a linguistic standard, which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see Linguistic imperialism). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors, who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the teaching of language, like in ELT, where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language.|$|E

50|$|With the {{addition}} of misuse cases, the notation can model both desired goals and active threats. The misuse case notation shows negative (possibly hostile) stakeholders as the primary actors for the misuse cases; these may be grouped {{on the right-hand side}} of the diagram. The notation may assist in discovering suitable mitigating or preventative goals, shown as subsidiary use cases. These often <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> improving security, safety, or reliability, which are non-functional goals. Non-functional requirements can to some extent be described in use case style using misuse cases to define negative goals; but the (positive) goals thus discovered are often functional. For example, if theft is a threat to security, then fitting locks is a mitigation; but that a door can be locked is a functional requirement.|$|E
