This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis.
