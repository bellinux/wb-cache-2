500|$|Arsenal started October with a 3–1 {{win against}} Sunderland, {{breaking}} Manchester United's Premier League record of 30 matches unbeaten. They however suffered their first {{defeat of the}} season, against Everton; teenager Wayne Rooney scored from long range in the last minute of the match. Wenger used his post-match press conference to praise the striker: [...] "At that age, Rooney is already a complete footballer. The <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> play. He's the best English under-20 I've seen since I came here [...]" [...] In spite of dominating their next match against Blackburn Rovers – [...] "27 goal attempts, 14 on target," [...] Arsenal were beaten 2–1; the winning goal was scored by Dwight Yorke in the second half. It was the team's third consecutive defeat in all competitions, their worst run since November 2000, and moved league leaders Liverpool four points clear {{at the top of}} the table.|$|E

[...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy {{has never really}} done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family <b>Guy</b> <b>can</b> be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} record {{two out of}} five stars, saying that Adams' [...] "fondness for obvious hooks" [...] had [...] "flattened into clichés". Matt O'Leary from Virgin Media criticised the album for Adams's [...] "over-familiar trademark" [...] and very clichéd, made the over-familiar sound of 11 a little more [...] "irksome". O'Leary gave the album two out of five stars. The Sunday Times {{reviewer}} Steve Jelbert wrote, [...] "Eleven studio albums into his career, the Canadian rocker returns with a set so devoid of surprises that it {{could easily have been}} created with a computer program." [...] He continued by criticising the album for what he saw as mundane lyrical metaphors, attempts of copying U2 and rigid one-note basslines. He concluded however that the album was better than Lenny Kravitz latest effort, It Is Time for a Love Revolution. Chuck Arnold and Christina Tapper of People gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four and stated that the 11 songs [...] "show that, at 48, Adams is still capable of capturing the essence of young, unbridled love. Sure, the <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> get sappy, but he's always sincere." ...|$|E
500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or <b>guy)</b> <b>can</b> relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E

500|$|... "The Don" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics, with Nas's lyrics drawing particular praise. Rico Barrino of Artistdirect praised Nas's rapping as {{being able to}} impress in different contexts, calling his lyrics [...] "both catchy and commanding" [...] and noted his [...] "precise, potent lyrical poetry honed by 20 years in the game". Writing for MTV News, Rob Markman called the production [...] "a sonic departure" [...] from Nas' previous work, but complimented his lyrics as [...] "vintage" [...] and pointed out {{the consistency of the}} lyrical quality throughout the song. In his review of [...] "The Don" [...] for About.com, Henry Adaso described the song as [...] "the type of lyrical exercise Nas only throws down once or twice per album", and that songs such as [...] "The Don" [...] gave a case for Nas' inclusion [...] "as one of hip-hop's all-time greats", also picking up on his [...] "assured" [...] boasts and the [...] "quiet confidence" [...] enveloped in his tone. Adaso also expressed a positive response towards the song's production, expressing his surprise that having three different producers working on the song had not led to a [...] "case of too many cooks in the kitchen", writing that [...] "instead, we get a cohesive, hard-hitting, face-melting, reggae-tinged beat". A reviewer of the song for DJBooth wrote of Nas' performance as [...] "at turns wistful, threatening and braggadocious", and praised the production's [...] "compulsively head-noddable groove". In their review of Life Is Good, Sputnikmusic recommended [...] "The Don" [...] to first-time listeners of Nas, stating to be an exhibition of Nas' [...] "incredible lyrical structures" [...] and [...] "how rapidly this <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> punch out the syllables". They also noted it as a [...] "change of pace" [...] from the more downtempo material on Life Is Good. In his review of Life Is Good for Prefix Magazine, Charlie Kaplan called [...] "The Don" [...] the album's [...] "clear highlight" [...] and felt it a fitting tribute to Heavy D's life and work, writing that it [...] "raises a glass to the recently departed overweight lover with a vivid tour of New York rap's classic soundscapes". For the chart week dated July 28, 2012, [...] "The Don" [...] debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 196.|$|E

[...] Alan Richman describes Schwa's caramelized sweetbread dessert as [...] "the finest dessert ever to emerge from foodstuffs that have no logical reason being used in a dessert." [...] BlackBook Magazine has described Carlson as [...] "culinary genius" [...] and [...] "one of Chicago’s best chefs," [...] while Frommer's remarks [...] "Carlson's sensory imagination sometimes rises to the level of sheer poetry."

Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying [...] "It's almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches." [...] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> throw a ball in a teacup." [...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove." ...|$|E

[...] HipHop DX said it [...] "oozed mass appeal without deteriorating into sloshy mainstream". [...] Colin McQuire from Pop Matters wrote that the [...] "piano-laden groove adds the texture it needs to be a bona fide Top 40 hit, and Fiasco’s crisp broken-hearted rhymes illustrate the exact type of accessibility the track needs to gain commercial notoriety." [...] A reviewer for entertainment site Pop Culture Podcast said, [...] "This one has chart topping single written all over it but due to its genuine lyrics and universal subject matter it doesn't feel like one that you have to 'sell out' to make." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 season, Cutler's {{final year}} of play at Vanderbilt, was his most successful. As an 11-game starter, he {{completed}} 273 of 462 passes (59.1%) for 3,073 yards, 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions, as {{he became the first}} Commodore to win the SEC Offensive Player of the Year (coaches and media) since 1967. With his senior-season performance, Cutler became the second Commodore to throw for more than 3,000 yards in a season, while his 273 completions and 21 touchdowns ranked second on the school’s single-season list. He led the Commodores to victories over Wake Forest, Arkansas, Ole Miss, Richmond and Tennessee. The Commodores also scored the second most points ever (42) laid upon the Florida Gators at their current home field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Vanderbilt nearly upset the 13th-ranked Gators before falling 49–42 in the second overtime after a controversial excessive celebration call prevented the Commodores from going for 2 at the end of regulation. Reflecting on Cutler's college career, former Denver Broncos safety John Lynch said, [...] "If this <b>guy</b> <b>can</b> take a bunch of future doctors and lawyers and have them competing against the Florida Gators, this guy is a stud." ...|$|E
