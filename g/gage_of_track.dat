40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the effects of specimen thickness on fatigue crack growth and fracture behavior of 7075 -T 6 and 7178 -T 6 aluminum alloy sheet and plate. Specimen thicknesses ranged from 5. 1 to 12. 7 mm (0. 20 to 0. 50 in.) for 7075 -T 6 and from 1. 3 to 6. 4 mm (0. 05 to 0. 25 in.) for 7178 -T 6. The stress ratios R used in the crack growth experiments were 0. 02 and 0. 50. For 7075 -T 6, specimen thickness had relatively little effect on fatigue-crack growth. However, the fracture toughness of the thickness <b>of</b> the thickest <b>gage</b> <b>of</b> 7075 -T 6 was about two-thirds of the fracture toughness <b>of</b> the thinner <b>gages</b> <b>of</b> 7075 -T 6. For 7178 -T 6, fatigue cracks generally grew somewhat faster in the thicker gages than in the thinnest gage. The fracture toughness <b>of</b> the thickest <b>gage</b> <b>of</b> 7178 -T 6 was about two-thirds of the fracture toughness <b>of</b> the thinner <b>gages</b> <b>of</b> 7178 -T 6. Stress intensity methods were used to analyze the experimental results. For a given thickness and value of R, the rate of fatigue crack growth was essentially a single-valued function of the stress intensity range for 7075 -T 6 and 7178 -T 6. An empirical equation developed by Forman, Kearney, and Engle fit the 7075 -T 6 and 7178 -T 6 crack growth data reasonably well...|$|R
