50|$|Sanjurjo {{turns his}} {{attention}} to conquering Gibraltar, the British enclave ceded to Britain in perpetuity by Spain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Spanish Nationalist troops suffer great losses from the naval artillery of the moored British warships, but with the aerial help of the German Condor Legion British resistance is overcome and the Royal Navy ships are forced to withdraw into the open sea. The conquest of Gibraltar is a fillip to Spanish national pride and to Sanjurjo's personal reputation, and might have strategic implications for later stages {{of the war in}} the Mediterranean. However, by depriving the British Empire of a highly valued strategic asset, Sanjurjo irrevocably ties the Spanish Nationalist cause with that of Nazi Germany, <b>foreclosing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving in power after a German defeat.Towards mid-1939 the long-deadlocked Madrid front becomes active, with both sides moving reinforcements there. The Nationalists aim to finally conquer the city, while the Republicans — who deploy to Madrid the International Brigades — seek to push them away decisively and end any further threat to the Spanish capital.|$|E
60|$|I WILL {{not attempt}} to {{describe}} the mixture of indignation and regret with which Ravenswood left the seat which had belonged to his ancestors. The terms in which Lady Ashton's billet was couched rendered it impossible for him, without being deficient in that spirit of which he perhaps had too much, to remain an instant longer within its walls. The Marquis, who had his share in the affront, was, nevertheless, still willing to make some efforts at conciliation. He therefore suffered his kinsman to depart alone, making him promise, however, that he would wait {{for him at the}} small inn called the Tod's Hole, situated, as our readers may be pleased to recollect, half-way betwixt Ravenswood Castle and Wolf's Crag, and about five Scottish miles distant from each. Here the Marquis proposed to join the Master of Ravenswood, either that night or the next morning. His own feelings would have induced him to have left the castle directly, but he was loth to forfeit, without at least one effort, the advantages which he had proposed from his visit to the Lord Keeper; and the Master of Ravenswood was, even in the very heat of his resentment, unwilling to <b>foreclose</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of reconciliation which might arise out of the partiality which Sir William Ashton had shown towards him, as well as the intercessory arguments of his noble kinsman. He himself departed without a moment's delay, farther than was necessary to make this arrangement.|$|R

2500|$|The Court had {{previously}} ruled in Frank v.

This <b>foreclosed</b> <b>any</b> federal review of the allegations of mob intimidation.

40|$|One way to {{discredit}} the suggestion that a statement is true just in virtue of its meaning is to observe that its truth {{is the subject of}} genuine disagreement. By appealing to the case of the unorthodox philosopher, Timothy Williamson has recast this response as an argument <b>foreclosing</b> <b>any</b> appeal to analyticity. Reconciling Quine’s epistemological holism with his treatment of the ‘deviant logician’, I show that we may discharge the demands of charitable interpretation even while attributing trivial semantic error to Williamson’s philosophers. Williamson’s effort to generalize the argument from disagreement therefore fails...|$|R
