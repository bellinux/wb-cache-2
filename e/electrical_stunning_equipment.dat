Hot boning resulted in significantly shorter sarcomere lengths and increased meat toughness, but <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> appeared to ameliorate these adverse effects.

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> in {{the process}} of {{slaughtering}} poultry is used to induce unconsciousness and immobilize the animal for easier processing. Unconsciousness is a function of brain damage. Brain damage has been studied with brain impedance recordings under ischemic conditions. This experiment studies brain impedance as a response to a general epileptiform insult caused by <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> and ischemia caused by exsanguination. Brain impedance was recorded in 10 broiler chickens for each of three killing methods: whole body <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning,</b> which induces cardiac arrest; head only <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> followed by exsanguination; and exsanguination without stunning. Brain impedance was converted into relative extracellular volume (ECV) values. Results showed that, immediately after <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning,</b> the ECV decreased 5. 5 % from base ECV. With exsanguination only, the ECV decreased from base ECV only after 4 min after neck cutting. The ECV decrease after 10 min did not differ between treatments. With a time of 228 s to reach one-half of the ECV decrease found at 10 min, <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> resulted in a much faster change in ECV than exsanguination only (373 s). Within the head only stunning group, six animals showed a response similar to that found with whole body stunning; the other four animals responded similarly to the animals that were exsanguinated only. It was concluded that brain impedance recordings used with <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> reflect brain damage; This damage was both epileptic and ischemic in nature. Whole body stunning induced immediate brain damage, suggesting that an adequate stun was delivered. The dual response found with head only stunning might indicate that this stunning method does not always produce an adequate stun...|$|R

40|$|The general {{method for}} {{stunning}} poultry before slaughter is by immersion of a chicken's head into an electrified waterbath. This method results in carcass and meat quality deficiencies.

In two experiments, this study examines the early postmortem metabolism in the breast muscle and its effect on ultimate meat quality. The first experiment describes the effects of 5 h feed deprivation on the availability of glycogen from the liver and the breast muscle, of waterbath and head-only <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> on pH and metabolite levels up to 6 h in unprocessed muscle, and the consequences on meat quality.

Forty-eight live broilers were obtained from a processing plant and transported to the pilot plant facility of the research center. Half the birds were electrically stunned prior to death, and half were not. Birds were processed in the following manner: bled by outside neck cut for 2 min, scalded for 2 min at 53 C, feathers removed, and left pectorialis major immediately removed. The remainder of carcass was eviscerated, head, neck, and feet removed, prechilled, stored for 24 hr at 2 C, and right p. major removed. The pH was taken {{at the time of}} muscle removal, the skinless p. major weighed, cooked in water at 88 C to 82 C, cooled, and weighed. A 2. 5 -cm wide strip was removed to measure objectively tenderness as force to shear. The entire procedure was replicated twice. There was a significant stun by age interaction for pH and percent weight loss due to cooking. Breast meat from birds stunned prior to death exhibited higher pH 20 min postmortem than meat from nonstunned birds. Stunning had no effect on ultimate postmortem pH. Breast meat cooked 20 min postmortem exhibited lower percentage weight loss than meat cooked 24 hr postmortem. The meat cooked 20 min postmortem exhibited significantly higher shear values-it was less tender-than meat cooked 24 hr postmortem.
