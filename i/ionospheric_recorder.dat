50|$|One of the {{principal}} contributions of Rao in the academic field was {{the establishment of a}} laboratory for Ionosphere and Space Research (ISRL) at the Waltair campus of Andhra University which would evolve into an advanced space science centre, and it was here, he hosted a number of researchers. He was also instrumental in introducing computer at the university. He maintained his interest in ultrasonics which he had worked on during his doctoral studies and his initial work at ISRL led to the discovery that diffraction patterns followed Braggs Law in high frequency regions. For furthering their research, the team led by him developed novel methodologies for measuring ultrasonic velocities in liquids and solids with high precision and developed purpose-built instruments such as transmitters, receivers and oscillographs for pulse measurement, seismic sounders and satellite signal recorders. He designed a multi-frequency HF phase path radar which was the first equipment of its kind that used spaced-receiver configuration. The other equipment developed by his team included an HF phase path sounder which was a first time development, as well as an <b>ionospheric</b> drift <b>recorder,</b> a meteor radar and a SOnic Detection And Ranging system (SODAR). He and his colleagues published seven articles detailing the body of their work in ultrasonics and six of them appeared in Nature. This pioneering research on ionospheric plasma contributed to the development of HF Doppler radar, meteor radar and SODAR systems presently in use. He also carried out studies on Ionospheric dynamo region and on the horizontal winds over a sunspot cycle. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He also edited three books, Physics of the solid state : commemoration volume to Professor S. Bhagavantam, and Bhagavantam Volume: Volume in Honour of Prof. S. Bhagavantam on the Occasion of the 60th Birthday, 14.04.1969 both festschrifts on his mentor, as well as Science, Technology and Education for Prosperity, and his work has drawn citations in books published by others.|$|R
