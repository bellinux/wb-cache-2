5|$|In 1109, a new diocese {{was created}} in England, at Ely, and Hervey was {{appointed}} to the bishopric created. While bishop, Hervey ordered the compilation of a house chronicle, which later became the Liber Eliensis. He supervised the construction of a causeway between Ely and Exning, which allowed <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Ely.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya also founded an {{organisation}} called Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Viklang Seva Sangh, {{headquartered in}} Satna, Madhya Pradesh. Its {{goal is to}} create community awareness and initiate child development programmes in rural India. Its primary objective is to supplement the education programmes of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University by helping disabled children get a good education. Aid is generally given in the form of facilities which enable <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education. Rambhadracharya also runs a hundred-bed hospital in Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} early days of alpine {{mountaineering}} a number of high-altitude mountain refuges have been positioned strategically across the massif to give climbers <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the high summits by permitting an overnight stay. The majority are owned by national mountaineering clubs, and many are wardened during the summer months, although the smaller bivouac huts are unmanned and have very basic facilities.|$|E

5|$|A new {{boarding}} house for girls was opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 2010, and in 2012, {{a new school}} building adjacent to the existing site, purpose-designed for music teaching, was opened by the Earl of Wessex (Patron of the school). This included a 100-seat recital hall and space for a 400-seat concert hall, which opens in 2017 as The Stoller Hall. The Long Millgate building continues {{to be used as}} a boys' {{boarding house}}, rehearsal and dining space, whilst the Palatine building was demolished in 2016 to reveal the previously hidden medieval buildings and allow <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the library.|$|E
5|$|Bosworth's {{first film}} role came after an open casting call in New York for the {{supporting}} part of Judith in the 1998 film, The Horse Whisperer. The film's producers needed {{someone who was}} already an experienced horse rider, leading to Bosworth's successful audition for the role. The film received positive reception from film critics. In 2000, she starred in the television series drama Young Americans, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a small part in the film Remember the Titans. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> auditions and better film parts.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) station along the Rockaway Beach Branch. The LIRR station opened in 1913 {{to replace the}} nearby Ramblersville station. The LIRR ceased operations at this station in 1950, and the New York City Transit Authority bought {{the section of the}} Rockaway Beach Branch that included this station in 1952. The subway station opened on June 28, 1956. Between 2000 and 2003, the subway station was completely reconstructed and a transfer to the new AirTrain JFK was built. The rebuilt complex was completed on December 17, 2003, providing <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> JFK Airport for large parts of the city.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} {{surrender}} of the Confederate States of America in 1865, Fort Jackson was abandoned. The lumber used in its construction was promptly salvaged for firewood and construction materials and, {{due to its}} proximity to the Long Bridge, the earthworks were flattened {{in order to provide}} <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Long Bridge. In the early 20th century, the fort's site was used for the footings and approaches to several bridges connecting Virginia and Washington. Today, no trace of the fort remains, though the site of the fort is contained within Arlington County's Long Bridge Park, and a National Park Service 2004 survey of the site indicated some archaeological remnants may still remain beneath the park.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E

5|$|The park is {{the most}} visited during {{the spring and summer}} months, when it is open between 8:00 and 19:00 (7:00pm) local time. In autumn and winter, it closes at 17:00 (5:00pm). Admission at the {{entrance}} must be paid. Camping, lighting fires, or setting up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden within the limits of the national park {{in order to protect the}} surrounding ecosystem. The park can be reached from the city center of Kuşadası via several dolmuş (share taxis) that regularly shuttle the route to the closest town of Güzelçamlı. Recently, there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Kuşadası and Güzelçamlı, in turn providing <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the park for visitors. Each year, around 700,000 foreign and domestic tourists visit the park.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Roa Bastos {{received}} a diversity of honors and distinctions. In 1941 he won the Ateneo Paraguayo Prize for his (unpublished) novel Fulgencio Miranda. This first award was followed by a British Council fellowship for journalism that enabled him to travel to Europe during World War II. In 1959 Roa Bastos won the Losada prize for his first published novel Hijo de hombre. The adaptation of this novel, for which he wrote the screenplay, won best film in the Spanish language and first prize of the Argentine Instituto de Cinematografia the following year. His most prestigious awards were a 1971 John Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for creative writers, and in 1989, the Cervantes Prize, an award given by the Spanish government for lifetime achievement, and Spanish language literature's most prestigious prize. Roa Bastos donated most of his prize money to provide <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> books in Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E

5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.|$|E
