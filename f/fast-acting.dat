5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a <b>fast-acting</b> diagnostic tuberculosis test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being <b>fast-acting,</b> the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely <b>fast-acting</b> and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some <b>fast-acting</b> and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering <b>fast-acting</b> benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{some states}} have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate, or <b>fast-acting</b> benzodiazepines like midazolam. Many states have since bought lethal {{injection}} drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members. In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Following the patch, a {{flavoured}} lollipop of fentanyl citrate {{mixed with}} inert fillers was introduced under {{the brand name}} of Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain. Fentanyl has been developed into an effervescent tab for buccal absorption much like the Actiq lollipop, followed by a buccal spray device for <b>fast-acting</b> relief and other delivery methods currently in development.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon has the {{potential}} to be a drug of recreational use, and has been found to have an addictive potential similar to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics. The mind- and judgment-altering effects of zaleplon are similar to those of many benzodiazepines, but the <b>fast-acting</b> nature and short half-life of the chemical mean high doses set on much more quickly and last for short periods of time (usually from 45 to 60 minutes).|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} can be painlessly accomplished, {{without risk}} of consciousness, by the injection {{of a single}} large dose of a barbiturate. By this reasoning, {{the use of any}} other chemicals is entirely superfluous and only serves to unnecessarily increase the risk of pain during the execution. Another possibility would be I.V administration of a powerful and <b>fast-acting</b> opioid, such as sufentanyl, which would ensure comfort while killing via respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|During winter, when reduced feeds are {{administered}} to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce {{the rate of}} algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no <b>fast-acting</b> remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|There are two independent, <b>fast-acting</b> safety {{shutdown}} systems as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate neutron absorber solution into the calandria.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} ECCS subsystem {{consists of}} two groups of six accumulator tanks, containing water blanketed with nitrogen under pressure of 10MPa, connected by <b>fast-acting</b> valves to the reactor. Each group can supply 50% of the maximum coolant flow to the damaged half of the reactor. The third group {{is a set of}} electrical pumps drawing water from the deaerators. The short-term pumps can be powered by the spindown of the main turbogenerators.|$|E
25|$|All other {{treatment}} addresses symptoms, with ibuprofen or paracetamol {{to reduce}} fever and pain and, if required, a <b>fast-acting</b> medication to dilate the airways for cough. As for aspirin, some research has suggested {{a correlation between}} children who take aspirin {{and the development of}} Reye syndrome. Some research has shown aspirin may not be the only medication associated with Reye, and even antiemetics have been implicated. The link between aspirin use in children and Reye syndrome development is weak at best, if not actually nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of food {{intolerance}} vary greatly, {{and can be}} mistaken for the symptoms of a food allergy. While true allergies are associated with <b>fast-acting</b> immunoglobulin IgE responses, {{it can be difficult}} to determine the offending food causing a {{food intolerance}} because the response generally takes place over a prolonged period of time. Thus, the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related. Food intolerance symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking the food in question, but sometimes symptoms may be delayed by up to 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Even single neurons have complex biophysical {{characteristics}} and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse {{under certain conditions}} through the axolemma), the <b>fast-acting</b> sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict {{a number of important}} features such as adaptation and shunting. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl transdermal patches (Durogesic/Duragesic) {{are used}} in chronic pain management. The patches work by slowly {{releasing}} fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage {{is based on the}} size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a <b>fast-acting</b> opiate (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.|$|E
25|$|Two main hemotoxic {{effects are}} caused by {{rattlesnake}} venom. First, zinc-containing metalloproteases act upon capillary endothelial cells to cause platelet aggregation and hemorrhage. Second, the platelet antagonist crotalin creates a severe bleeding effect as it binds to the surface proteins, blocking aggregation. These two starkly different effects may seem counterproductive, but the effect should be profound. Firstly, endothelial-cell disruption causes lysis and internal bleeding. Then, as these hemorrhages increase, the natural thrombin response is hindered by the effect of crotalin increasing the toxic effect. Their observed hunting technique is a bite-and-release method, so a <b>fast-acting</b> toxin would be ideal. Assuming the natural median prey would be a small rodent such as a mouse, the bite would elicit a fear response, quickening heart rate and increasing blood pressure. This would speed the toxic effect, as well as spread the hemolytic and hemorrhagic effects.|$|E
25|$|All known {{scorpion}} species possess venom {{and use it}} {{primarily to}} kill or paralyze their prey {{so that it can}} be eaten. In general, it is <b>fast-acting,</b> allowing for effective prey capture. However, as a general rule, they will kill their prey with brute force if they can, as opposed to using venom. It is also used as a defense against predators. The venom is a mixture of compounds (neurotoxins, enzyme inhibitors, etc.) each not only causing a different effect but possibly also targeting a specific animal. Each compound is made and stored in a pair of glandular sacs and is released in a quantity regulated by the scorpion itself. Of the 1,000+ known species of scorpion, only 25 have venom that is deadly to humans; most of those belong to the family Buthidae (including Leiurus quinquestriatus, Hottentotta, Centruroides and Androctonus).|$|E

2500|$|On 20 March 2002 Ibn al-Khattab who {{during the}} Second Chechen War participated in leading his militia against Russian forces in Chechnya, {{as well as}} {{managing}} the influx of foreign fighters and money was killed when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with [...] "a <b>fast-acting</b> nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative".|$|E
2500|$|Pseudocholinesterase (also called butyrylcholinesterase or [...] "BCHE") hydrolyzes {{a number}} of choline-based {{compounds}} including cocaine, heroin, procaine, and succinylcholine, mivacurium, and other <b>fast-acting</b> muscle relaxants. Mutations in the BCHE gene lead to deficiency in the amount or function of the protein, which in turn results in a delay in the metabolism of these compounds, which prolongs their effects. Succinylcholine is commonly used as an anaesthetic in surgical procedures, and a person with BCHE mutations may suffer prolonged paraylasis. Between 1 in 3200 and 1 in 5000 people carry BCHE mutations; they are most prevalent in Persian Jews and Alaska Natives. As of 2013 there are 9 genetic tests available.|$|E
2500|$|Although Mitchell had {{stressed}} [...] "war-time conditions", {{the tests}} were under static conditions and {{the sinking of the}} Ostfriesland was accomplished by violating rules agreed upon by General Pershing that would have allowed Navy engineers {{to examine the effects of}} smaller munitions. Navy studies of the wreck of the Ostfriesland show she had suffered little topside damage from bombs and was sunk by progressive flooding that might have been stemmed by a <b>fast-acting</b> damage control party on board the vessel. Mitchell used the sinking for his own publicity purposes, though his results were downplayed in public by General of the Armies John J. Pershing who hoped to smooth Army/Navy relations. The efficacy of the tests remain in debate to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{opens up}} various {{political and economic}} issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are <b>fast-acting,</b> comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As {{a result of these}} differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called [...] "free rider problem"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the [...] "free driver" [...] problem).|$|E
2500|$|DSM-5 axis I disorders, {{particularly}} major depressive disorder, and axis II disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder, {{increase the}} risk of suicide. [...] Individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders are at increased risk compared to individuals with just one of the two disorders. [...] While antidepressants may not directly decrease suicide risk in adults, they are in many cases effective at treating major depressive disorder, and as such are recommended for patients with depression. [...] There is evidence that long-term lithium therapy reduces suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. [...] Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or shock therapy, rapidly decreases suicidal thinking. [...] Choice of treatment approach is made based on the patient's presenting symptoms and history. [...] In cases where a patient is actively attempting suicide even while on a hospital ward, a <b>fast-acting</b> treatment such as ECT may be first-line.|$|E
2500|$|Khattab later {{survived a}} heavy-calibre bullet {{wound to the}} stomach and a {{landmine}} explosion. He was killed during the night of 19–20 March 2002, when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with [...] "a <b>fast-acting</b> nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative". [...] The messenger, a Dagestani double agent known as Ibragim Alauri, was turned by the FSB on his routine courier mission. Khattab would receive letters from his mother in Saudi Arabia, and the FSB found {{this to be the}} most opportune moment to kill Khattab. It was reported that the operation to recruit and turn Ibragim Alauri to work for the FSB and deliver the poisoned letter took some six months of preparation. Alauri was reportedly tracked down and killed a month later in Baku, Azerbaijan on Shamil Basayev's orders. Ibn Al-Khattab was succeeded by Emir Abu al-Walid.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{literally}} hundreds {{of different types of}} synapses. [...] In fact, there are over a hundred known neurotransmitters, and many of them have multiple types of receptors. [...] Many synapses use more than one neurotransmitter—a common arrangement is for a synapse to use one <b>fast-acting</b> small-molecule neurotransmitter such as glutamate or GABA, along with one or more peptide neurotransmitters that play slower-acting modulatory roles. [...] Molecular neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad groups: [...] chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems. [...] When a chemically gated ion channel is activated, it forms a passage that allows specific types of ions to flow across the membrane. [...] Depending on the type of ion, the effect on the target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory. [...] When a second messenger system is activated, it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target cell, which may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects, such as increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the cell to stimuli, or even altering gene transcription.|$|E
2500|$|Cyanoacrylates are a {{class of}} <b>fast-acting</b> {{adhesives}} and glues. Better known under the brand name [...] "Super Glue," [...] cyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype electronics (see Wire wrap), flying model aircraft, and as retention dressings for nuts and bolts. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have also made them popular for use in simple woodworking, industrial binding, and appliance repair. The history of cyanoacrylates is one of accidental discovery when researchers under Dr. Harry Coover conducted experiments on adhesive chemicals in order to devise a clear plastic {{that could be used}} for precision gunsights for soldiers fighting in World War II. Failing in their experimentations, the practical usefulness of cyanoarcrylates did not materialize until much later when in 1951, Coover, who was then working at Eastman Kodak, came to the realization that the sticky adhesives had unique properties in that they required no heat or pressure to permanently bond two items together. In light of his invention of [...] "Super Glue," [...] Coover filed U.S. patent #2,768,109 on June 2, 1954 and it was issued to him on October 23, 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Morphine, {{the archetypal}} opioid, and other opioids (e.g., codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, dihydromorphine, pethidine) all exert a similar {{influence}} on the cerebral opioid receptor system. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, and tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak μ-opioid receptor agonist properties. [...] Tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering [...] "opioid-like" [...] effects (through mild agonism of the mu receptor) but also by acting as a weak but <b>fast-acting</b> serotonin releasing agent and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. [...] Tapentadol, with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what {{is believed to be}} a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils), seizures (tramadol), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{nationwide}} shortage of the lethal injection drug, sodium thiopental, led the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to instead consider pentobarbital, which {{is commonly used}} for animal euthanasia. Oklahoma state law is not specific in prescribing {{the use of a}} <b>fast-acting</b> barbiturate, allowing flexibility for such a substitution. Duty and two other inmates on death row filed a federal appeal that the new protocol would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In a hearing before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the professor of anesthesia from Harvard Medical School testified for the defense that pentobarbital might not succeed in preventing [...] "severe, excruciating pain". However, the professor of anesthesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst countered in a deposition for the state that 5grams of pentobarbital would be sufficient to cause unconsciousness and death in minutes. Representatives from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Death Penalty Information Center both testified that no other state had used pentobarbital and that they believed Duty would be the first person to be executed by the drug. On December 14, 2010, the Circuit Judges Jerome Holmes and Neil Gorsuch joined Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe in a unanimous decision upholding the use of the drug, citing that the state witness had demonstrated [...] "substantially more clinical experience with the use of pentobarbital". A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States over the constitutionality of the state's execution protocol was also denied.|$|E
2500|$|PT-76E - This is {{the most}} recent PT-76 {{modernization}} program. It increases the vehicle's battle efficiency by including a radical growth in firepower, which required a new turret AU-220M and other weapons. This variant is armed with a 57mm autocannon (which is a modification of the 57mm L/76.6 S-60 AA gun. It was developed by CB Burevestnik (Nizhniy Novgorod). Its armor-piercing tracer rounds fired from 1,120 m can penetrate 100mm of steel armor. The new weapon can destroy most modern APCs and IFVs. It can also engage aerial targets out to 6km. The autocannon uses two types of ammunition, splinter-tracer and armor-piercing-tracer. However, {{it is possible to}} fire a special zenith shell. The gun can fire single shots, short bursts (2 to 5 rounds), or long bursts (up to 20 rounds). It can also fire continuously up to 120 rounds per minute. This system functions by using the energy generated by each round, not by using an external power source. Firepower is improved 5.5 times in the PT-76E over the PT-76B. The PT-76E is fitted with a more powerful UTD-20 6-cylinder 4-stroke V-shaped airless-injection water-cooled multifuel 15.8 litre diesel engine. It develops 300hp (224kW) at 2,600rpm and is taken from the BMP-1 as is the transmission. The power-to-weight ratio has been improved to [...] per ton. This also increases the maximum road speed from 44km/h to 60km/h, with an average cross country speed from 32km/h to 42km/h. Other engine options are the UTD-23 or V-6BF. The vehicle has new tracks. Driver fatigue has been reduced. The vehicle's survivability on the battlefield is improved with the introduction of a new <b>fast-acting</b> firefighting system. The vehicle also has improvements in fire control and optical equipment, for instance the new sights 1P67 and [...] "Liga-S". This modernization program increases the PT-76's performance by 2.7 times, which is still comparatively low. The vehicle was accepted by the Russian marines in 2006 and about 40 or 50 vehicles were ordered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{method of}} assimilating {{individual}} life-forms into the collective has been represented differently over time. The only constant {{is that the}} infant, and fetal humanoids have been grown in an accelerated state and surgically receive implants connected directly into the brain (cannot be removed without death), as well as ocular devices, tool-enhanced limbs, armor, and other prosthetics. In Star Trek: First Contact, the method of adult assimilation is depicted with the more efficient injection of nanoprobes into the individual's bloodstream through a pair of tubules that spring forth from the drone's hand (while in [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] and , at least some Borg were shown with a syringe like prosthetic that also acted as a data port {{that allowed them to}} interface directly with technology and share data between each other). Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a usually <b>fast-acting</b> process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact, though it seems that the longer the victim is being injected, the quicker they can be fully transformed. The individual is then taken away for complete assimilation by drones. The tubules can also allow for direct interfacing with technology, while they are also shown to be able to reconfigure and enhance such technology into Borg technology. Sometimes assimilated Borg have been noted to be neither male nor female. [...] One theory could be that their reproductive systems have been removed upon assimilation, yet drones such as Captain Picard and Seven of Nine are easily identified as male and female. The other reason may be that the species from whence they came was gender-less. Drones who have escaped the collective have also been shown to have a gender. The individual has all traces of individuality removed and implants are attached to the new drone so it can become an integrated part of the collective. This method of assimilation is also shown to be much more surgical in nature. In Star Trek: First Contact a captured crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.|$|E
