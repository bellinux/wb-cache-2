In December Ford took his case to the Commander in Chief (and commander of New Guinea Force), General Sir Thomas Blamey. After being lectured by Ford for about an hour on the history and dangers of malaria, and what needed to be done, Blamey said: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>you,</b> Colonel Ford. If I don't do these things, my troops will suffer." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Constable was {{a member}} of the Whig party, likely due to the close {{friendship}} of his father-in-law and Henry Clay. Due mainly to frustrations over how the Whig party had treated him, Constable decided to switch parties. He is quoted as saying, [...] "that the party was dominated by old fogies who are indifferent to younger men." [...] His inclination toward the Democratic Party almost led to a fistfight between himself and Lincoln in a tavern in Paris, Illinois. Lincoln was quoted as saying, [...] "Mr. Constable, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> perfectly, and have noticed for some time that you have been slowly and cautiously picking your way over to the Democratic party." [...] After this heated exchange, the men reconciled, but by 1856 Lincoln claimed that Constable had left the party. In 1858, Constable was the Illinois elector at-large for the election of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.|$|E
2500|$|Wishing to {{participate}} personally {{in the war}} against Spain, McCord used his influence with President McKinley to be appointed colonel of the First Territorial Infantry. On July 1, 1898, the governor requested a leave of absence so he could serve in the army. Secretary of Interior Cornelius N. Bliss responded with, [...] "Do not see how you can recede your voluntary request to be commissioned as Colonel of Arizona regiment. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> have accepted command and {{it is important for the}} public service that your resignation as Governor be promptly forwarded to this Department."

2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband.

[...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can you explain to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E
