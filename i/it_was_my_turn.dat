2500|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone {{was out on}} {{the wing}} of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the year, Friedgen had {{challenged}} {{his players}} {{with the phrase}} [...] "Are you in or are you out?" [...] After the dramatic first-year turnaround, he was a high-profile candidate for an NFL position, and his players repeated his question. He remained at Maryland and said, [...] "Last year the kids {{made a commitment to}} me and I realized <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> We've got plenty left to do. This program has not yet arrived." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> now, to {{enlighten}} Ezra Jennings. I stopped him, {{before he could}} say any more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' {{said the}} still undaunted Violet, when the torrent of unsparing jest had {{expended}} itself, 'now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Let {{me show you}} one short piece. This--"To L."' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Sagramore said: [...] "Well, Sir Knight, {{that was}} certes {{a very great}} buffet that you gave my fellow, but now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. [...] "I {{should have}} the {{satisfaction}} of saying, 'Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> I break with your serene highness!'" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to stare}} dumbly before I could manage to ask: “For Tolosa?” {{in a very}} knowing tone.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to hold HER. She {{tried to}} break away from me and get down first to the door.|$|E
6000|$|I lit. I drifted up to a gate with a {{swarm of}} people, and when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> the head clerk says, in a business-like way-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> old lady," [...] ejaculated Higgs, and {{straightway}} {{missed her}} clean {{from a distance}} of five yards. A second shot was more successful, and she rolled over, dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrades, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to throw}} in this great game. I have heard and {{considered}} all, and I think it best that I should be surrendered, with the Augusta, to the Greeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> then," [...] {{says the}} Colonel, {{with a glance}} of kindness. The anger has {{disappeared}} from under his brows; {{at that moment the}} menaced battle is postponed.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to be surprised. If the Baron took a like {{cognizance}} {{of all my}} countrymen {{who came}} to New Orleans, he was a busy man indeed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now {{to shake}} a doleful head. [...] "There are no extra instruments," [...] I told them. [...] "They too have {{disappeared}} {{as did the}} wireless apparatus." ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to {{be unable}} to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears, tears of rage, for {{remember}} that I was still very feeble. But Marie spoke for me.|$|E
6000|$|Eva {{looked up}} with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, [...] "Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to Ruskin, Kant, or Plato?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah," [...] quoth Sir Ector, [...] "that {{was a very}} {{wonderful}} buffet you struck my fellow. But now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you, and I hope God {{will send}} me a better fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to dictate}} terms, Alan. You {{know what they}} are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work {{yourself}} into this fever. The thing has to <b>be</b> done. Face <b>it,</b> and do it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to come to}} a {{standstill}} now. I tried vainly, in the gathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I asked a little impatiently what he meant.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down, laid Higgs's head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let {{a little}} of the water trickle between his swollen lips.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to shiver and become pale, as any may guess {{who may have}} chanced to read the history of Mameena, and the turn of Miss Holmes to watch me with {{animated}} interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be the best plan," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Now I will go back and take Bertie's place. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to <b>be</b> on watch, and he will be wanting to hear the news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, son, {{wait till}} I have finished. Almighty! {{for the last}} twenty minutes you have been sitting as silent as an ant-bear in a hole, and I tell you that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now; why, then, do you {{interrupt}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You told me {{we should}} see each other no more, and you have come back. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to go, and to go forever. I say that we shall see each other no more, and my word shall not be broken." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to stop suddenly. In {{the excited}} state of my curiosity, at that moment, the chance {{reference}} to Mr. Fairlie's place of residence, {{on the lips}} of my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{declined}} {{to tell me}} whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude {{to the rest of}} the sex. When I asked why, she declared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to tell her what I had been doing.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, and so I laughed with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "It is not all. This {{explanation}} I {{have made}} for your sake, Mannering, and <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> a truthful and full one. Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> I {{have a few}} words to say to you on my own account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may. Even {{were you}} forcing {{your way into}} the castle I will {{guarantee}} that no hair of their heads shall be injured. And now, prince, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to question. I see Saxon helmets and shields among your followers. Whence come they?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now, madam, {{to inform}} you that I do not {{understand}} a single word you are saying. I should have thought that the use of a vacuum for removing dust was a mark of civilization rather than of savagery.|$|R
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? And {{where do}} you live?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to ask questions, and I popped them out {{as if from a}} Little by Little.|$|E
60|$|Next morning <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> for I was {{the only}} aide-de-camp left. I was his {{favourite}} aide-de-camp. His heart went out always to a smart soldier. I declare that I think {{there were tears in}} his black eyes when he sent for me that morning.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to smile. He {{was very}} cunning, {{but it was}} evidently this that he was aiming at. He had some reason to conceal {{the fact that he}} had run away with a woman, and he was using every {{precaution}} to hide her whereabouts. I answered with decision.|$|E
6000|$|The {{three girls}} stayed {{quietly in the}} palace for a little while, embroidering, spinning, weaving, and tending their birds and flowers, when early one morning, the {{youngest}} princess entered {{the door of the}} emperor's private apartments. 'My father, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now. Perhaps I shall get the better of that wolf!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrice {{have you}} saved my life, and now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to save yours, {{for there is}} no other path. <b>It</b> may <b>be</b> that they will kill you afterwards, but if so, I shall be glad to have died first in order that I may be ready to greet you in the land beyond.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> indeed <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to <b>be</b> {{surprise}}d, {{and with}} the surprise came glimmering.|$|R
