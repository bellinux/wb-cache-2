5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{products}} {{has been}} the major export industry in the past, but diversification and growth of the economy has reduced its share. In the 1970s, the {{pulp and paper industry}} accounted for half of Finnish exports. Although this share has shrank, pulp and paper is still a major industry with 52 sites across the country. Furthermore, several of large international corporations <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> are based in Finland. Stora Enso and UPM were placed #1 and #3 by output in the world, both producing more than ten million tons. M-real and Myllykoski also appear on the top 100 list.|$|E
25|$|In Haycraft's {{history of}} the {{construction}} equipment business (2000), he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in-house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business,</b> and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition {{and the need for}} subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often doesn't pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.|$|E

25|$|An FAO report {{claims it}} was {{believed}} in colonial times that the forest is a national resource which should be utilised for {{the interests of the}} government. Like coal and gold mines, {{it was believed}} that forests belonged to the state for exploitation. Forest areas became a source of revenue. For example, teak was extensively exploited by the British colonial government for ship construction, sal and pine in India for railway sleepers and so on. Forest contracts, such as that of biri pata (leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon), earned so much revenue that it was often used by the people involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> as a leverage for political power. These contracts also created forest zamindars (government recognised forest landowners). Additionally, as in Africa, some forests in India were earmarked by the government officials and the rulers with the sole purpose of using them for hunting and sport for the royalty and the colonial officials.|$|E

The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business,</b> you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are.

500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats {{what it is to be}} a gentleman <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> still." ...|$|E
