5000|$|The {{subjective}} context principle {{suggests that}} PIM systems should allow users retrieve their information {{items in the}} same context that they had previously used in order to bridge the time gap between these two events.By [...] "context" [...] the approach refers to other information items that were used {{at the time of}} interaction with the item, thoughts that the users may have regarding the item, the phase the user got to in the interaction with the item and other people the user collaborates with regarding the <b>information</b> <b>item.</b>|$|E
50|$|The user-subjective {{approach}} {{takes advantage}} of the fact that in PIM the person who retrieves the information is the same person who had previously stored it. PIM {{can be seen as a}} communication between the person and him\her self at two different times: the time of storage and the time of retrieval. The PIM system design should help facilitate that unique communication by allowing the user use subjective (user-dependent) attributes in addition to the standard objective ones. PIM systems should capture these subjective attributes when the user interacts with the <b>information</b> <b>item</b> (either automatically or by using direct manipulation interface) in order to help the user retrieve the item later on.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the more}} {{subjective}} processes in decision making involve forming an opinion about each decision-relevant <b>information</b> <b>item</b> (i. e., the impact and importance of that item to any decision option) and then selecting one option based upon some form of cognitive weighting of the entire information pool. The decision support package described here simplifies and quantifies these two processes by supplying an intuitive interface to capture: (1) location of the <b>information</b> <b>item</b> (2) content of the <b>information</b> <b>item</b> (3) quality of the information (4) timeliness of the information (5) decision option impacted (6) nature of that impact and (7) {{the importance of the}} item. Using a weighting matrix, the subjective assessments of impact and importance for each <b>information</b> <b>item</b> are converted into single score and then all the <b>information</b> <b>item</b> scores for a particular decision option are summed. The final total scores are used to quantitatively assess the ranking all the various decision options. An exchange module makes all assessments available to all participants, enabling the group to quickly focus on the key differing individual assessments causing any lack of group consensus...|$|E
40|$|Activity {{in social}} media such as blogs, micro-blogs, social net-works, etc is {{manifested}} via interaction that involves text, images, links and other <b>information</b> <b>items.</b> Naturally, some items attract more attention than others, expressed with large volumes of linking, commenting or tagging activity, {{to name a few}} examples. More-over, high attention can be indicative of emerging events, breaking news or generally indicate <b>information</b> <b>items</b> of interest to a vast set of people. The numbers associated with digital social activity are astonishing: in excess of millions of blog posts, tweets and forums updates per day, millions of tags in photos, news articles or blogs. Being able to identify <b>information</b> <b>items</b> that gather much attention in such a real time information collective is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider the problem of early online identifica-tion of items that gather a lot of attention {{in social media}}. We model social media activity using ISIS, a stochastic model for Interacting Streaming Information Sources, that intuitively captures the con-cept of attention gathering <b>information</b> <b>items.</b> Given the challenge of the information overload characterizing digital social activity, we present sequential statistical tests that enable early identifica-tion of attention gathering items. This effectively reduces the set of items one has to monitor in real time in order to identify pieces of information attracting a lot of attention. Experiments on real data demonstrate the utility of our model, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed sequential statistical tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a Bluetooth Village Guide Book (VGB) scenario for use in the Kelvin Grove Urban Village located in Brisbane, Australia. An Information Point Station Network (IPSN) was developed, along with software for two types of mobile computing devices. The implementation consists of several Information Point Stations (IPSs) placed at locations of significance, with access to <b>information</b> <b>items</b> on a centralized server. Once a user is registered on the network, he/she is given the opportunity to experience context- (and eventually user-) aware information on demand and in various multimedia formats. These <b>information</b> <b>items</b> are selected by the user, either by way of a menu system appearing on their mobile computing device or a more intuitive pointer-tag system. <b>Information</b> <b>items</b> are then ‘beamed’ to the user’s mobile computing device for the user to view. Bluetooth was selected as the medium of choice due to its prevalence on most modern mobile computing devices such as Personal Digital Assistants and mobile (cell) phones. This fact, coupled with the nature of Bluetooth communications lacking the requirement for line-of-sight meant users could retrieve location-aware information at the “locality” level. The implementation was found to be successful and was tested with multiple users accessing <b>information</b> <b>items</b> from a given IPS as well as multiple IPSs attached to the centralized server. Still, there is further work to be done on the VBG software, the user-registration system and on creating an embedded solution for the individual Information Point Stations...|$|R
