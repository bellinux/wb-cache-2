He {{may be a little}} odd and flighty, perhaps, many of us are that; but downright mad! and express himself as he does, respectfully, and in quite poetical language, and making offers with so much thought, and care, and prudence--not as if he ran into the streets, and went down upon his knees to the first chit of a girl he met, as a madman would!

You can tell when a person feels that way. I wouldn't accuse him if he hadn't made me feel that way. I don't accuse him; <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> you that that's how it is. He can't help it; we can't govern our affections. Do I govern mine? mightn't he say that to me? It's because he is so fond of my mother, whom we lost so long ago. She was beautiful, and very, very brilliant; he is always {{thinking}} of her. I am not at all like her; Aunt Penniman has told me that. Of course, it isn't my fault; but neither is it his fault. All I mean is, it's true; and it's a stronger reason for his never being reconciled than simply his dislike for you." ...|$|E

It was not, as you seem to remember, with the sight of Mr. Mitchett that the {{question}} of Aggie's hand began to occupy me. I should be ashamed of myself if it weren't constantly before me and if I hadn't my feelers out in more quarters than one. But I've not so much as thought of Mr. Mitchett--who, rich as he may be, is the son of a shoemaker and superlatively hideous--for a reason I don't at all mind telling you. Don't be outraged if I say that I've for a long time hoped you yourself would find the right use for him." [...] She paused--at present with a momentary failure of assurance, from which she rallied, however, to proceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble. [...] "Forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> you once for all how it strikes me, I'm stupefied at your not seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty. Oh I know you want to, but you appear to me--in your perfect good faith of course--utterly at sea. They're one and the same thing, don't you make out? your interest and your duty. Why isn't it convincingly plain to you that the thing to do with Nanda is just to marry her--and to marry her soon? That's the great thing--do it while you CAN. If you don't want her downstairs--at which, let me say, I don't in the least wonder--your remedy is to take the right alternative. Don't send her to Tishy--" ...|$|E
60|$|And, now, but {{one word}} more. You may wonder, perhaps, that I have spoken all this night {{in praise of}} war. Yet, truly, if it might be, I, for one, would fain join in the cadence of hammer-strokes that should beat swords into ploughshares: and that this cannot be, is not the fault of us men. It is your fault. Wholly yours. Only by your command, or by your permission, can any contest take place among us. And the real, final, reason for all the poverty, misery, and rage of battle, {{throughout}} Europe, is simply that you women, however good, however religious, however self-sacrificing for those whom you love, are too selfish and too thoughtless to take pains for any creature out of your own immediate circles. You fancy that you are sorry for the pain of others. Now <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> you this, that if the usual course of war, instead of unroofing peasants' houses, and ravaging peasants' fields, merely broke the china upon your own drawing-room tables, no war in civilised countries would last a week. I tell you more, that at whatever moment you chose to put a period to war, {{you could do it}} with less trouble than you take any day to go out to dinner. You know, or at least you might know if you would think, that every battle you hear of has made many widows and orphans. We have, none of us, heart enough truly to mourn with these. But at least we might put on the outer symbols of mourning with them. Let but every Christian lady who has conscience toward God, vow that she will mourn, at least outwardly, for His killed creatures. Your praying is useless, and your churchgoing mere mockery of God, if you have not plain obedience in you enough for this. Let every lady in the upper classes of civilised Europe simply vow that, while any cruel war proceeds, she will wear black;--a mute's black,--with no jewel, no ornament, no excuse for, or evasion into, prettiness.--I tell you again, no war would last a week.|$|E
