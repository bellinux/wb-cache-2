The accident left her with a 24-hour memory for over two years. She could remember yesterday but not the day before, and her life was in chaos.

These would include possession by the devil; a plummet from a 30-story-window (which she survived); being used as a surrogate for genetically engineered babies, Rex and Cassie, during a four-year coma; being mind-controlled to believe she was a serial killer; and becoming pregnant late in life and suffering a miscarriage, which caused her to have <b>hysterical</b> <b>amnesia.</b> She has also been kidnapped numerous times over the past 30 years. She is a doctor, wife, mother, twin, grandmother and great-grandmother.|$|E
50|$|According to ego psychology, ego strengths, later {{described}} by Kernberg (1975), include the capacities to control oral, sexual, and destructive impulses; to tolerate painful affects without falling apart; {{and to prevent}} the eruption into consciousness of bizarre symbolic fantasy. Synthetic functions, in contrast to autonomous functions, arise from {{the development of the}} ego and serve the purpose of managing conflict processes. Defenses are synthetic functions that protect the conscious mind from awareness of forbidden impulses and thoughts. One purpose of ego psychology has been to emphasize that some mental functions can be considered to be basic, rather than derivatives of wishes, affects, or defenses. However, autonomous ego functions can be secondarily affected because of unconscious conflict. For example, a patient may have an <b>hysterical</b> <b>amnesia</b> (memory being an autonomous function) because of intrapsychic conflict (wishing not to remember because it is too painful).|$|E
