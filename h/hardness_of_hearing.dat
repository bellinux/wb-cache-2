60|$|One day in London {{during the}} late summer I was amused {{and at the same}} time a little disgusted at this general {{indifference}} to the delicate beauty in a bird-sound which distinguishes the willow wren even among such delicate singers as the warblers: it struck me as a kind of æsthetic <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> I heard the song in the flower walk, in Kensington Gardens, on a Sunday morning, and sat down to listen to it; and for half an hour the bird continued to repeat his song two or three times a minute on the trees and bushes within half a dozen yards of my seat. Just after I had sat down, a throstle, perched on the topmost bough of a thorn that projected over the walk, began his song, and continued it a long time, heedless of the people passing below. Now, I noticed that in almost every case the person approaching lifted his eyes to the bird above, apparently admiring the music, sometimes even pausing for a moment in his walk; and that when two or three came together they not only looked up, but made some remark about the beauty of the song. But from first to last not one of all the passers-by cast a look towards the tree where the willow wren was singing; nor was there anything to show that the sound had any attraction for them, although they must have heard it. The loudness of the thrush prevented them from giving it any attention, and made it practically inaudible. It was like a pimpernel blossoming by the side of a poppy, or dahlia, or peony, where, even if seen, it would not be noticed as a beautiful flower.|$|E

Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

30|$|We {{know that}} the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> a {{material}} directly relates to wear, and that increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the steel can reduce the wear of wheels and rails. There {{is a limit to}} the benefit <b>of</b> increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the wheel and rail, however, and simply improving the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> material to reduce the wear is not an effective method. Many studies have shown that a plastic deformation layer on the surface of hard steel is formed during wearing, significantly increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the worn surface [5, 6, 7, 8]. This forms a special material which consists of a hard external material and a tough internal material which is ideal for railway operation. However, depending upon plastic deformation to improve surface hardness is a limited technique.|$|R

He had been mentally retarded since childhood, and suffered from muscle weakness and <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> He was diagnosed as having bilateral cataracts at the age of 30, when loss of hair gradually started to be noticed. Physical examination revealed atrophy of bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles and muscle weak- ness.

As for the criterion of deafness, ones that can not hear 2 tones at 20 db or one at 25 db were considered deaf. Deaf ears and doubtful cases for deaf determined by the method just mentioned, were re-examined on two other occasions and the changes in their hearing were investigated. Regarding subjective symptoms as to the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing,</b> careful attention were paid on the records previously prepared at individual's home and as the results the following data obtained. 1. The number of those who had been considered to be deaf at the first test gradually decreased significantly at each of of two subsequent tests. 2. The percentage of deaf pupils proved to be 14. 8 per cent, while that of deaf ears 11. 9 per cent of the total examined. 3. The majority of those who had been considered deaf on the first hearing test but adjudged to be of normal hearing on the following tests, showed the fall in the threshold at 8124 cps [...] 4. Therefore, {{in order to determine the}} <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> in young persons it is necessary to pay a special attention to a higher tone and to conduct hearing tests at least three times on different days. 5. Those who were unconsciously deaf amounted to 67. 0 per cent of the total deaf pupils, and the same among those whose deafness proved to be slight, namely, witihn average 25 db at speech range in both ears, amounted to 80. 8 per cent. 6. Most of unconscious deafness had their origin in the Eustachian tube: and cases with unconscious deafness in both ears having the origin at the tube amounted to 90. 2 per cent and the same in one ear amounted to 75. 0 per cent. 7. Deafness with its origin at the Eustachian tube occupied the major portion (86. 8 %) of those slightly hard of hearing within average 25 db at speeeh range. 8. The lesions of the nasal cavity and the pharynx that had been associated with deafness were simple chronic rhinitis, hypertrophic rhinitis, sinusitis and deviation of the nasal septum. Comparing the incidence of deafness in the ears with these lesions to those without lesions, deafness proved to be more predominant in the ears with the lesions. 9.

40|$|Listening effort {{helps explain}} why people who are hard of hearing are prone to fatigue and social withdrawal. However, a one-factor model that cites only effort due to <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> is {{insufficient}} as {{there are many who}} lead happy lives despite their disability. This paper explores other contributory factors, in particular motivational arousal and pleasure. The theory of rational motivational arousal predicts that some people forego listening comprehension because they believe it to be impossible and hence worth no effort at all. This is problematic. Why should the listening task be rated this way, given the availability of aids that reduce its difficulty? Two additional factors narrow the explanatory gap. First, we separate the listening task from the benefit derived as a consequence. The latter is temporally more distant, and is discounted as a result. The second factor is displeasure attributed to the listening task, which increases listening cost. Many who are hard of hearing enjoy social interaction. In such cases, the actual activity of listening is a benefit, not a cost. These people also reap the benefits of listening, but do not have to balance these against the displeasure of the task. It is suggested that if motivational harmony can be induced by training in somebody who is hard of hearing, then the obstacle to motivational arousal would be removed. This suggests a modified goal for health care professionals. Don’t just teach those who are hard of hearing how to use hearing assistance devices. Teach them how to do so with pleasure and enjoymen...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{discover}} the cause of, and a cure for singing disability, seventy-nice children and two adults were observed and given treatment between 1939 and the present time. Fifty of them were given various tests to this end, records being kept. Fifty-three were cured, five left the district, fifteen are still having lessons, and eight were improved but not cured, though it now seems {{that they might have}} been. The main cause was slower learning than normal, due to the absence of singing at home, or a lack of interest which often went with lower musical intelligence. Slower learning, as a rule only presented difficulty where it had been the subject of comment or criticism, and where the child had not been allowed to try to sing. The mental attitude thus created was a factor in almost every case. Occasionally the cause was an affection of the ear, nose, or throat; though <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> was scarcely ever the sole reason for the trouble. In a few instances it was due to a slight fault in the vocal organs; and in others, to bad production of the voice. In no case was it due to an abnormally low register; and tine deafness was found to be non-existent. In order to remedy the defect the child was helped to locates notes, then persuaded to sing ascending scales, and also made to attempt to sing songs of very easy type. The vowel sound ‘loo’ frequently, but not exclusively used, was found to be a splendid corrective of bad voice-production. Constant encouragement was given; and great patience and determination were necessary. The good results of the work were evident in the increased interest in musical activities, and in the general enthusiasm of those who had been taught to sing...|$|E
