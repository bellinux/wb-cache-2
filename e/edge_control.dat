5|$|Players may {{initially}} {{choose from}} five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, USA, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in {{fields such as}} technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each have different strengths in categories such as balance and <b>edge</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

500|$|The first item {{of debris}} {{identified}} as coming from flight 370 {{was the right}} flaperon (a trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surface). It was discovered {{at the end of}} July 2015 on a beach in Saint-André, on Réunion, an island in the western Indian Ocean, about [...] west of the underwater search area. It was transported from Réunion—an overseas department of France—to Toulouse, where it was examined by France's civil aviation accident investigation agency, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), and a French defence ministry laboratory. Malaysia sent investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse. On 3 September, French officials announced that serial numbers found on internal components of the flaperon link it [...] "with certainty" [...] to Flight 370. These serial numbers were retrieved via borescope.|$|E

2500|$|The wing {{design of}} the Buccaneer was a {{compromise}} between two requirements: a low aspect ratio for good gust response, and high aspect ratio to give good range performance. [...] The small wing was suited to high-speed flight at low altitude; however, a small wing did not generate sufficient lift that was essential for carrier operations. [...] Therefore, BLC was used upon both the wing and tailplane, having the effect of energising and smoothing the boundary layer airflow, which significantly reduced airflow separation {{at the back of}} the wing, and therefore decreased stall speed, and increased effectiveness of trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces, including flaps and ailerons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{flatness}} and <b>edge</b> drop <b>control</b> {{system is}} a coupled multivariable control system. Realizing the coupling relationship quantitative analysis and decoupling control of them {{is one of the}} most important parts of achieving the high-precision control. In this paper, the flatness and <b>edge</b> drop <b>control</b> abilities of all the control actuators are analyzed. The coupling relationship between flatness and edge drop is analyzed. The decoupling control method is proposed to realize the decoupling control of flatness and edge drop. Simulation results represent that the flatness and <b>edge</b> drop <b>control</b> performance is improved effectively...|$|R
40|$|The <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> {{geometry}} of a hydraulic pinion/rack power steering valve is studied and the valve characteristics modelled. Non-facet and two-facet <b>control</b> <b>edges</b> {{have been studied}} and the geometry data of the later are from a commercial product. The characteristics from simulation and experiment of a test-rig show the steering feeling, and the two-facet <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> valve was designed for safer and friendly steering manipulation. The hydraulic pump pressure, determined {{as a function of}} the steering twist angle, is incorporated in the steering control valve characteristics. A modification at the <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> geometry is proposed, and its characteristics show that there is large room available at the <b>control</b> <b>edge</b> design to improve the steering feeling and safe manipulation...|$|R

50|$|VLMs can {{compute the}} flow around a wing with {{rudimentary}} geometrical definition. For a rectangular wing {{it is enough}} to know the span and chord. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, they can describe the flow around a fairly complex aircraft geometry (with multiple lifting surfaces with taper, kinks, twist, camber, trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces and many other geometric features).|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} with composite designs {{were carried out}} {{by a variety of}} inventors through the 1950s, but all faced {{what appeared to be a}} catch-22; a boot stiff enough side-to-side to offer good <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> was too stiff front-to-back to allow the natural flexing motion of the leg that occurs during turns or on bumps. Early examples using plastics or fibreglass invariably proved far too rigid to be skied.|$|E
50|$|On 26 June 1981, Dan-Air Flight 240 an HS748 2A mail {{flight from}} Gatwick Airport to East Midlands Airport crashed at Nailstone killing the three (3) crew members on board.

50|$|In 1980 four {{designs were}} {{introduced}} that all {{rose to a}} point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg {{using a variety of}} methods. They offered much greater <b>edging</b> <b>control,</b> and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.|$|R
50|$|The {{pre-production}} {{version of}} the F/A-18 was an ideal host aircraft for proving AAW technology, a relatively high wing aspect ratio for a fighter, with adequate strength, but no additional stiffness was added for static aeroelastic issues. The X-53 F/A-18 was modified to allow two leading <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces to work in concert with its two trailing edge surfaces to control wing aeroelastic twist and provide excellent high speed rolling performance.|$|E
50|$|A further {{design of}} {{tailplane}} is the V-tail, {{so named because}} that instead of the standard inverted T or T-tail, there are two vertical fins angled {{away from each other}} in a V (if they're arranged like a V, {{at least one of them}} isn't vertical). To produce yaw like a rudder, the two trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces move in the same direction. To produce pitch like an elevator, the surfaces move in opposite directions.|$|E
50|$|The Bekas {{is built}} from wood {{and covered in}} plywood. The wing uses a NACA 8-H-12 airfoil and has greater span and higher aspect ratio than the BKB-1 to achieve its goals. The wing {{features}} outboard trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces that act both as elevator for pitch control and aileron for roll control. The wing is swept 15° and has a chord of 38 in. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel.|$|E
50|$|Perceptions, in PCT, are {{constructed}} and controlled in {{a hierarchy of}} levels.

This organizing principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract philosophical and theoretical constructs.|$|R

50|$|Construction was all-wood with plywood {{skinning}} for loaded {{areas and}} fabric covering for lightly loaded {{areas such as}} control surfaces and the wings aft of the main spars. The undercarriage consisted of a semi-recessed mainwheel and small skids under the nose and tail.

5000|$|AAW Technology employs wing {{aeroelastic}} flexibility for a {{net benefit}} {{through use of}} multiple leading and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>control</b> surfaces activated by a digital flight control system. At higher dynamic pressures, AAW control surfaces are used as [...] "tabs" [...] which are deflected into the air stream to produce favorable wing twist instead of the reduced control generally associated with “aileron reversal” caused by trailing edge surfaces. The energy of the air stream is employed to twist the wing with less control surface motion; the wing itself creates the control forces.|$|E
