40|$|A semi-span wing, {{equipped}} with an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tip,</b> which was varied in planform and size was examined. Total wing aerodynamic loading {{was obtained from the}} wind tunnel scale system. The wing tip was mounted on a separate six-component strain gauge balance, which provided the aerodynamic loads on the tip.

The aerodynamic load characteristics of the wing and of the tip were presented with the tip at several incidence angles relative to the wing inboard section...|$|E
40|$|Six <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tip</b> shapes were tested: {{a square}} (baseline) tip, an ogee tip, a subwing tip, a swept tip, a winglet tip, {{and a short}} ogee tip. In hover at the lower {{rotational}} speeds the swept, ogee, and short ogee tips had about the same torque coefficient, and the subwing and winglet tips had a larger torque coefficient than the baseline square tip blades. The ogee and swept tip blades required less torque coefficient at lower rotational speeds and roughly equivalent torque coefficient at higher rotational speeds compared with the baseline square tip blades in forward flight. The short ogee tip required higher torque coefficient at higher lift coefficients than the baseline square tip blade in the forward flight test condition...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} study was initiated to systematically determine {{the impact of}} selected blade tip geometric parameters on aeroelasticity conformable rotor performance and loads characteristics. The model articulated rotors included baseline and torsionally soft blades with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tips.</b> Seven blade tip designs were evaluated on the baseline rotor and three tip designs were tested on the torsionally soft blades. The designs incorporated a systematic variation in three geometric parameters: sweep, taper, and anhedral. The rotors were evaluated in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at several advance ratios, lift and propulsive force values, and tip Mach numbers. Based on the test results, tip parameter variations generated significant rotor performance and loads difference for both baseline and torsionally soft blades.

50|$|A {{screwdriver}} is a tool, manual or powered, {{for turning}} (driving or removing) screws. A typical simple screwdriver has a handle and a shaft, and a tip that the user inserts into the screw head to turn it. The shaft is usually made of tough steel to resist bending or twisting. The tip may be hardened to resist wear, {{treated with a}} dark tip coating for improved visual contrast between tip and screw—or ridged or treated for additional 'grip'. Handles are typically wood, metal, or plastic and usually hexagonal, square, or oval in cross-section to improve grip and prevent the tool from rolling when set down. Some manual screwdrivers have <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tips</b> that fit into a socket {{on the end of}} the shaft and are held in mechanically or magnetically. These often have a hollow handle that contains various types and sizes of tips, and a reversible ratchet action that allows multiple full turns without repositioning the tip or the user's hand.|$|R
50|$|Most {{soldering}} irons for electronics have <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tips,</b> {{also known}} as bits, that vary in size and shape for different types of work. Pyramid tips with a triangular flat face and chisel tips with a wide flat face are useful for soldering sheet metal. Fine conical or tapered chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the flat face to hold {{a small amount of}} solder are available. Tip selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred. Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.|$|R

40|$|A {{three-phase}} {{research program}} has been undertaken to study the acoustic signals due to the aerodynamic interaction of rotorcraft main rotors and tail rotors. During the first phase, two different rotor models with several <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tips</b> were tested in the Langley 4 - by 7 -Meter Tunnel on the U. S. Army rotor model system. An extensive acoustic data base was acquired, with special emphasis on blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise. The details of the experimental procedure, acoustic data acquisition, and reduction are documented. The overall sound pressure level (OASPL) of the high-twist rotor systems is relatively insensitive to flight speed but generally increases with rotor tip-path-plane angle. The OASPL of the high-twist rotors is dominated by acoustic energy in the low-frequency harmonics. The OASPL of the low-twist rotor systems shows more dependence on flight speed than the high-twist rotors, {{in addition to being}} quite sensitive to tip-path-plane angle. An integrated band-limited sound pressure level, limited by 500 to 3000 Hz, is a useful metric to quantify the occurrence of BVI noise. The OASPL of the low-twist rotors is strongly influenced by the band-limited sound levels, indicating that the blade-vortex impulsive noise is a dominant noise source for this rotor design. The midfrequency acoustic levels for both rotors show a very strong dependence on rotor tip-path-plane angle. The tip-path-plane angle at which the maximum midfrequency sound level occurs consistently decreases with increasing flight speed. The maximum midfrequency sound level measured at a given location is constant regardless of the flight speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{elimination}} of all external incisions {{is an important}} step in reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures. Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is an incision-less surgery and provides explicit benefits such as reducing patient trauma and shortening recovery time. However, technological difficulties impede the widespread utilization of the NOTES method. A novel robotic tool has been developed, which makes NOTES procedures feasible by using multiple <b>interchangeable</b> tool <b>tips.</b> The robotic tool has the capability of entering the body cavity through an orifice or a single incision using a flexible articulated positioning mechanism and once inserted is not constrained by incisions, allowing for visualization and manipulations throughout the cavity. Multiple <b>interchangeable</b> tool <b>tips</b> of the robotic device initially consist of three end effectors: a grasper, scissors, and an atraumatic Babcock clamp. The tool changer is capable of selecting and switching between the three tools depending on the surgical task using a miniature mechanism driven by micro-motors. The robotic tool is remotely controlled through a joystick and computer interface. In this thesis, the following aspects of this robotic tool will be detailed. The first-generation robot is designed as a conceptual model for implementing a novel mechanism of switching, advancing, and controlling the tool tips using two micro-motors. It is believed that this mechanism achieves a reduction in cumbersome instrument exchanges and can reduce overall procedure time and the risk of inadvertent tissue trauma during exchanges with a natural orifice approach. Also, placing actuators directly at the surgical site enables the robot to generate sufficient force to operate effectively. Mounting the multifunctional robot on the distal end of an articulating tube provides freedom from restriction on the robot kinematics and helps solve some of the difficulties otherwise faced during surgery using NOTES or related approaches. The second-generation multifunctional robot is then introduced in which the overall size is reduced and two arms provide 2 additional degrees of freedom, resulting in feasibility of insertion through the esophagus and increased dexterity. Improvements are necessary in future iterations of the multifunctional robot; however, the work presented is a proof of concept for NOTES robots capable of abdominal surgical interventions...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{velocimeter}} {{has been}} used to study the flow surrounding a 2. 13 -m-diameter, two-bladed, teetering model-scale helicopter rotor operating in the hover condition. The rotor system employed <b>interchangeable</b> blade <b>tips</b> over the outer 25 % radius. A conventional rectangular planform and an experimental ogee tip shape were studied. The radial distribution of the blade circulation was obtained by measuring the velocity tangent to a closed rectangular contour around the airfoil section at a number of radial locations. A relationship between local circulation and bound vorticity is invoked to obtain the radial variations in the sectional lifting properties of the blade. The tip vortex-induced velocity was also measured immediately behind the generating blade and immediately before the encounter with the following blade. The mutual influences between blade loading, shed vorticity, and the structure of the encountered vortex are quantified by the results presented and are discussed comparatively for the rectangular and ogee planforms.

40|$|Study Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the first case}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy performed with percutaneous instruments (The Percuvance System, Teleflex Incorporated, Wayne, PA). Design: The basis {{of the system is}} a < 3 -mm diameter shaft that, when connected to an introducer tool tip, can be inserted percutaneously through the skin. The introducer tool tip can then be exchanged outside the body {{for a wide variety of}} 5 -mm <b>interchangeable</b> surgical tool <b>tips.</b> The shaft is sufficiently strong to hold structures, and surgeons can use its <b>interchangeable</b> tool <b>tips</b> to grasp, cut, and manipulate tissue. We used a 3 -dimensional high-definition 10 -mm flexible tip endoscope (ENDOEYE FLEX 3 D, Olympus Winter & IBE GMBH, Hamburg, Germany). Background: Minilaparoscopy is an attractive approach for hysterectomy due to advantages such as reduced morbidities and enhanced cosmesis. However, it has not been popularized because of the lack of suitable instruments and high technical demand. The Percuvance system represents a significant advance in minimally invasive surgery. Setting: Catholic University of the Sacred Hearth, Rome, Italy. Patient: A 53 -year-old, multiparous patient with endometrial endometroid cancer grade 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient provided informed consent to use the images and video of the procedure. Institutional review board approval was not required. Intervention: The patient was hysteroscopically diagnosed with endometrial cancer after removal of an endometrial polyp adnexectomy. Once referred to our center, surgical staging was planned, including total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Laparoscopy with 2 lateral percutaneous and 1 soprapubic 3 -mm instruments was believed to be feasible to achieve these procedures. Main Results: The operation was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Operative time was 80 minutes overall, and blood loss was 50 mL. The pathology report confirmed endometrial endometroid cancer grading 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient was discharged on day 1. After 2 months, no late complications or recurrence was detected. Conclusion: Percutaneous total hysterectomy is technically feasible, and the use of this novel device permits surgeons to mantain a standard setting. Further studies are mandatory to define the benefits, advantages, and costs of this novel approach with respect to other minimally invasive approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of present-day {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} blade tips are simple designs based on historical trends. There is, however, {{some evidence that}} varying the design of the tip can result in significant changes in performance characteristics such as power output, noise, and structural loading. Very few studies have tested this idea on an actual rotating blade and there is much to be investigated. Thus, a project was devised to examine experimentally the effect of various tip designs on an operational rotating wind turbine rotor. A tapered, twisted blade 1. 6 m in length was custom designed for use in the UW Wind Energy Research Facility using the blade element momentum (BEM) method. A coupling mechanism was designed such that the outer 10 % of each blade could be exchanged to evaluate the effect of different tip designs. A set of three blades was fabricated out of fibre-reinforced plastic, while the tips were machined out of maple wood on a CNC milling machine. The blade was evaluated with a standard rectangular tip to establish baseline performance against which to compare the alternative tip configurations. The three-bladed rotor was tested at shaft speeds from 100 rpm to 240 rpm in wind speeds up to the facility maximum of 11. 1 m/s. The rotor was found to have a maximum power coefficient of 0. 42 at a tip speed ratio of 5. 3 and a 1. 45 kW rated power at a wind speed of 11 m/s. The performance was compared to predictions made using the BEM method with airfoil data generated using a modified Viterna method and the Aerodas method. While the Aerodas data was capable of predicting the power fairly accurately from 5 m/s to 10 m/s, the modified Viterna method predicted the entire curve much more accurately. Two winglet designs were also tested. The first (called Maniaci) was designed by David Maniaci of Pennsylvania State University and the other (called Gertz) was designed by the author. Both winglets were found to augment the power by roughly 5 % at wind speeds between 6. 5 m/s and 9. 5 m/s, while performance was decreased above and below this speed range. It was calculated that the annual energy production could be increased using the Maniaci and Gertz winglets by 2. 3 % and 3 %, respectively. Considering the preliminary nature of the study the results are encouraging and it is likely that more optimal winglet designs could be designed and evaluated using the same method. More generally, this study proved that the blades with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tips</b> are capable of being used as an evaluation testbed for alternative wind turbine blade tip designs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Robotic-assisted {{minimally}} invasive surgery systems not only have the advantages of traditional laparoscopic instruments but also have other important advantages, including restoring the surgeon&# 039;s hand-eye coordination and improving the surgeon&# 039;s precision by filtering hand tremors. Unfortunately, these benefits have {{come at the expense}} of the surgeon&# 039;s ability to feel. Various solutions for restoring this feature have been proposed. Methods: An actuated modular force feedback-enabled laparoscopic instrument was proposed that is able to measure tip-tissue lateral interaction forces as well as normal grasping forces. The instrument has also the capability to adjust the grasping direction inside the patient body. In order to measure the interaction forces, strain gauges were employed. A series of finite element analyses were performed to gain an understanding of the actual magnitude of surface strains where gauges are applied. The strain gauge bridge configurations were calibrated. A series of experiments was conducted and the results were analysed. Results: The modularity feature of the proposed instrument makes it <b>interchangeable</b> between various <b>tip</b> types of different functionalities (e. g. cutter, grasper, dissector). Calibration results of the strain gauges incorporated into the tube and at the base of the instrument presented the monotonic responses for these strain gauge configurations. Experimental results from tissue probing and tissue characterization experiments verified the capability of the proposed instrument in measuring lateral probing forces and characterizing artificial tissue samples of varying stiffness. Conclusion: The proposed instrument can improve the quality of palpation and characterization of soft tissues of varying stiffness by restoring sense of touch in robotic assisted {{minimally invasive}} surgery operations...|$|R
40|$|Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is {{a fairly}} recent {{surgical}} approach that {{eliminates the need for}} external incisions on the patient. NOTES takes the minimally invasive surgery paradigm a step further by using a natural orifice as the pathway to transport surgical tools to the surgical site and completely eliminating the need for even the smallest incision on the skin. Although the concept of NOTES has been in existence for the past decade, technological deficiencies prevent it from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot for NOTES has been developed to overcome these limitations and make the approach a feasible one. The NOTES robot comprises a multifunctional robotic manipulator and a steerable and articulating drive mechanism. The robotic manipulator carries three <b>interchangeable</b> surgical tool <b>tips</b> in a cartridge that enables tool changing without removing the robot from the patient. A stereovision camera is attached {{at the tip of the}} robotic manipulator to provide real-time video feedback to the surgeon. A steerable articulating drive mechanism is connected to the robotic manipulator to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. Besides its guiding capabilities, the drive mechanism is also shape-lockable which provides a stable platform for the robotic manipulator to perform surgeries. The design process and engineering analysis for the articulating drive mechanism are discussed in detail in this thesis. The first-generation drive mechanism is designed and built as a proof of concept. Bench-top tests show that the design achieves the purpose of guiding and positioning the robotic manipulator. It is believed that the articulating drive mechanism can provide freedom of movement to the robotic manipulator and help circumvent some of the difficulties faced by approaches such as typical minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The second generation of the articulating drive mechanism is presented next, whereby the overall size of the drive mechanism is reduced significantly and the components in part of the drive transmission are also altered. Phantom Omni joysticks from SensAble Technologies are used as control consoles for the drive mechanism. The programming for the drive mechanism controls has been developed and is presented in this thesis. Although further improvements are necessary to the current iteration of the robot, bench-top testing results show promise of continued success for the multifunctional robot for NOTES.
