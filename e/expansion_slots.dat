5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible {{based on}} the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 {{megabytes}} of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards (a Wang invention that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Commodore had a {{reputation}} for announcing products that never appeared, so sought to quickly ship the C64. Production began in spring 1982 and volume shipments began in August. The C64 faced a wide range of competing home computers, but with a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors. In the United States the greatest competitors were the Atari 8-bit 400, the Atari 800, and the AppleII. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. The latest revision in the aging Apple II line, the Apple IIe, had higher-resolution graphics modes than the C64. Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an open architecture system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external ROM cartridge port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception. Initial C64 sales were nonetheless relatively slow {{due to a lack of}} software, reliability issues with early production models, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983 however, a trickle of software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing, especially with price cuts from $600 to just $300.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{considered}} a failure, the Lisa nevertheless introduced {{a number of}} advanced features that would not re-appear on the Macintosh {{for a number of}} years. Among these was an operating system which featured protected memory and preemptive multitasking, and a more document-oriented workflow. The hardware itself was also much more advanced than the Macintosh, with a hard drive and support for up to 2megabytes (MB) of RAM, <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> and a larger higher-resolution display. The main exception being that while the Macintosh also used the 68000 processor, the Macintosh initially used a version clocked at 7.89Mhz, compared to the 5Mhz version used in the Lisa. The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its associated programs overtaxed the slower processor enough that users perceived it to be sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic {{focused on}} the {{processor}} performance and lack of <b>expansion</b> <b>slots.</b> Liza Schafer of Home Office Computing praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the [...] display because a full US letter page ( [...] × 11inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: [...] "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get you working on that novel, database, or spreadsheet." [...] PC Week criticized {{the lack of a}} faster processor, stating, [...] "The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." [...] Similarly, PC Users review concluded, [...] "The slow processor and lack of <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". MacWEEK described it as a [...] "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision {{six and a half years}} later". Computer Gaming World was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.|$|E
500|$|Original {{marketing}} {{materials for the}} Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 × dual-core 2.66GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words [...] "starting at" [...] or [...] "from" [...] when describing the pricing, but the online US Apple Store listed the [...] "Mac Pro at $2499", the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26GHz each. Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> for graphics adapters and other expansion cards.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 model had two PCI Express (PCIe) 2.0 <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> and two PCI Express 1.1 slots, {{providing}} them with up to 300W of power in total. The first slot was double wide and intended to hold the main video card, arranged with an empty area {{the width of a}} normal card beside it to leave room for the large coolers modern cards often use. In most machines, one slot would be blocked by the cooler. Instead of the tiny screws typically used to fasten the cards to the case, in the Mac Pro a single [...] "bar" [...] held the cards in place, which is itself held in place by two [...] "captive" [...] thumbscrews that can be loosened by hand without tools and will not fall out of the case.|$|E

2500|$|Late in {{the product}} life of the Lisa, there were {{third-party}} hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa features <b>expansion</b> <b>slots.</b> Like the Apple II, it was an [...] "open system". The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets/slots. There were two RAM slots, one CPU slot and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there were three [...] "Lisa" [...] slots, parallel to each other. This flexibility provided {{the potential for a}} developer to create a replacement for the CPU [...] "card" [...] to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations {{from other parts of the}} system.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the Apple I, Wozniak {{designed}} the Apple II, the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built-in. Inspired by [...] "the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a $1 chip, while colors in the PAL system were achieved by [...] "accident" [...] when a dot occurred on a line, and to this day he has no idea how it works. During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> while Wozniak wanted six. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II {{became one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers.|$|E

2500|$|Updated Motorola CPUs made {{a faster}} machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took {{advantage}} of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh II at $5500, powered by a [...] Motorola 68020 processor. The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked {{the start of a new}} direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty. Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.|$|E
