Amine-treated Quebracho agent is compatible with other chemical additives in Synthetic-Based Fluids and it shows high-temperature stability, low fluid losses and good Rheological properties. Traditionally <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling fluids {{have been used to}} optimize drilling performance primarily due to the high level of wellbore stability and high penetration rates shown while using these fluids. <b>Invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> fluids require various additives such as emulsifiers, fluid-los-control (FLC) agents, viscosifier etc. The paper includes the laboratory evaluation for high temperature application of two agents in <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling fluids...|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to maintain morphology and rheological properties of oil-based drilling fluid while meeting the requirements of high-temperature operation. For first time, octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMOS)-modified core-shell silica NPs, synthesized by the authors, were used as the only emulsifier to stabilize the <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> of water in oil (poly 1 -decene) as a drilling fluid model. In addition, the rheological properties and morphology of the prepared stable <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> were investigated, and the best model for prediction of flow behavior, yield stress, and plastic viscosity was determined.|$|E

30|$|An {{oil-based}} {{drilling fluid}} should be stable and tolerant to high temperatures {{for use in}} deep drilling. An <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> of water in oil {{is a good choice}} as an oil-based drilling fluid which is a mixture of a solid phase and two immiscible liquid phases stabilized by a polymeric surfactant. In deep drilling, due to high temperatures, the polymeric surfactant degrades and a phase separation occurs. Here, octadecyltrimethoxysilane-modified silica nanoparticles were used to form a stable <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> of water in oil for the drilling fluid model which resulted in a milky fluid with the formation of 60  µm water droplets. In addition, rheological study showed that using hydrophobic silica nanoparticles resulted in a stable water in oil <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> with desired properties for a drilling fluid that can be modified by adjusting the nanoparticle nature and content. Aging experiments at 120  °C indicated that they also have good stability at high temperatures for challenging drilling operations.|$|E

However compatibility of the vegetable oils with the usual chemical additives is still a major challenge that calls for compatible and non-toxic substitutes. This study examined the suitability of hen egg yolk as a non-toxic emulsifier in <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling mud using vegetable oil continuous phase. 8 ml of the Egg yolk which was separated from the albumen was added dropwise as a primary emulsifier to a 70 / 30 oil-water ratio <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling mud formulated with Jatropha vegetable oil. The electrical stability was tested using electrical stability tester at the recommended test temperature of 48. 9 ºC and later at 120 ºC to check any variation at elevated temperature. The stability values in volts were 398 V and 289 V respectively. A similar formulation using a standard emulsifier (versacleanVB) an amidoamine gave stability values as 201 V and 188 V respectively indicating that higher stability was attained with the egg yolk. The viscosities of the mud samples were also tested giving plastic viscosities of 52 and 49 centipoise at 50 ºC for the egg yolk and verscleanVB emulsified muds respectively.

Due to the high encapsulation efficiency of proteins under physiological conditions and {{the simplicity of the}} protocol, it has been widely used to prepare various cell models. However, the lamellarity of liposomes prepared by this method has not been evaluated quantitatively. Here, we prepared liposomes that were partially stained with a fluorescent dye, and analyzed their fluorescence intensity under an epifluorescence microscope. The fluorescence intensities of the membranes of individual liposomes were plotted against their diameter. The plots showed discrete distributions, which were classified into several groups. The group with the lowest fluorescence intensity was determined to be unilamellar by monitoring the exchangeability of the inner and the outer solutions of the liposomes {{in the presence of the}} pore-forming toxin α-hemolysin. Increasing the lipid concentration dissolved in oil increased the number of liposomes ∼ 100 times. However, almost all the liposomes were unilamellar even at saturating lipid concentrations. We also investigated the effects of lipid composition and liposome content, such as highly concentrated actin filaments and Xenopus egg extracts, on the lamellarity of the liposomes. Remarkably, over 90 % of the liposomes were unilamellar under all conditions examined. We conclude that the <b>inverted</b> <b>emulsion</b> method can be used to efficiently prepare giant unilamellar liposomes and is useful for designing cell models...|$|R

A low oil-water ratio is beneficial in producing low fluid loss which is essential for wellbore stability. This study examined the possibility of 50 / 50 oilwater ratio <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling mud using a vegetable oil continuous phase. Jatropha oil was used as continuous phase. 12 ml of egg yolk which was separated from the albumen was added as the primary emulsifier additive. The rheological, stability and filtration properties were examined. The plastic viscosity and yield point were found to be 36 cp and 17 Ib/ 100 ft 2 respectively. The electrical stability at 48. 9 ºC was 353 v and the 30 minutes fluid loss was 6 ml.

This study indicates that with a good mud composition using guided empiricism, 50 / 50 oil-water ratio <b>invert</b> <b>emulsion</b> drilling mud is feasible with a vegetable oil continuous phase.

50|$|Emulsified Fuels are {{emulsions}} {{composed of}} water and a combustible liquid, either oil or a fuel. Emulsions are a particular example of a dispersion comprising a continuous and a dispersed phase. In the case of emulsions both phases are the immiscible liquids, oil and water.

Microemulsions are isotropic whereas macroemulsions are prone to settling (or creaming) and changes in particle size over time.
