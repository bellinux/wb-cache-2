The first leg was held in West Germany and Borussia won 3–0 to put themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> to reach the final going into the second leg in the Netherlands. Borussia won the second leg 2–1 to win the tie 5–1 on aggregate and progress to their first European final.|$|E
5|$|Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in Flensburg {{and offered}} himself as second-in-command. He {{maintained}} {{that he was}} entitled to a position in Dönitz's interim government as Reichsführer-SS, believing the SS would be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.|$|E
5|$|Tange's {{interest}} in urban studies put him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> to handle post war reconstruction. In {{the summer of}} 1946 he was invited by the War Damage Rehabilitation Board to put forward a proposal for certain war damaged cities. He submitted plans for Hiroshima and Maebashi. His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a seaside park in Ujina was not.|$|E

50|$|The Libertad, well {{armed and}} {{prepared}} for action, immediately abandoned the attempt to capture a prize ship.

5|$|Party Politics, {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled up after the water jump when <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position.</b> Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April he had run unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E
5|$|The motive behind Edward's {{change of}} heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's {{behaviour}} turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to {{advance the cause of}} the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E
5|$|The repercussions {{from the}} Rapid Wien ties {{followed}} Celtic into the 1985–86 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign. The first round saw them pitted against old foes Atlético Madrid. Mo Johnston's headed goal from a Davie Provan cross and Pat Bonner's late penalty save from Rubio secured a 11 draw away in Madrid, putting Celtic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> {{to win the}} tie. The second leg in Glasgow, however, was played {{in front of an}} empty stadium as punishment for the fans' behaviour the previous season in the replayed game against Rapid. In the unreal atmosphere of playing behind closed doors, Celtic toiled and lost 21 for another early European exit.|$|E
50|$|The most {{imposing}} {{building in}} the early town would have been Bury Castle, a medieval fortified manor house. The castle was built in 1469 by Sir Thomas Pilkington, lord of the manors of Pilkington and Bury, and a powerful member of the Lancashire gentry. It sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defensive <b>position</b> on high ground overlooking the Irwell Valley.|$|R

5|$|For the club's centenary {{season of}} 197475, Saunders brought {{in only two}} new players, Frank Carrodus and Leighton Phillips. At {{the end of his}} first season in charge, Villa were back in the First Division after {{finishing}} second, and had won the 1975 League Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Villa beat Norwich City 10 with Ray Graydon scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the 197576 season Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board. Ellis left the club <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> on the field. They were in the First Division and the UEFA Cup for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 51 by Antwerp in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the 197677 season, two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 32 in the 1977 Final after a second replay.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored a}} hard hitting 76 {{in the first}} innings of the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take control, but a {{stubborn}} partnership by Bailey and Willie Watson saw England hang on for a draw. Davidson bowled only 24.5 overs for the match, and Wardle was his only wicket. Rainy weather greeted {{the players in the}} Third Test at Old Trafford and more than half the playing time was washed out. Davidson took 2/60 in the drawn match, removing Reg Simpson and Willie Watson. Australia were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> {{at the start of the}} final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, with England leading by only 78 runs with five wickets in hand. However, Bailey (38) and Jim Laker (48) stubbornly resisted with a mixture of time-wasting and dour defence. Davidson eventually removed both, but there was not enough time remaining to secure an Australian victory. His match figures of 3/59 from 50.1 overs were in large part due to the defensive tactics of England. The fate of The Ashes thus came down to the Fifth Test at The Oval. Davidson scored 22 and 21 and could not take a wicket as England won by eight wickets to regain the urn for the first time in two decades. Australia had blundered by omitting a specialist spinner, mistakenly thinking that the pitch would not spin. Davidson hit England's spinners out of the attack for a period, but succumbed to the variable bounce of the pitch.|$|E
5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position,</b> they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the name of Bungay is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon title Bunincga-haye, {{signifying}} the land belonging to the tribe of Bonna, a Saxon chieftain. Due to its high position, protected by the River Waveney and marshes, the site was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defensive <b>position</b> and attracted settlers from early times. Roman artefacts have been found in the region.|$|R

Hibs then lost their next five league games and drifted down the league, eventually finishing in 7th place.|$|R

25|$|After a year hiatus, the Greys {{returned}} with a short bench and started the rebuilding process. Not much hope of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way.

25|$|By {{the middle}} of October, City were second in the league, two points behind leaders Chelsea and three points ahead of rivals Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham.
