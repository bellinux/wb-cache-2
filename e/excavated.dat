The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images.

50|$|<b>Excavate</b> {{relationships}} are still uncertain; {{it is possible}} that they are not a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the <b>excavates</b> is far from clear, although it seems like there are several clades within the <b>excavates</b> which are monophyletic.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the groups mentioned in the table above, the genus Malawimonas is {{generally considered to be}} a member of Excavata owing to its typical <b>excavate</b> morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to <b>excavate</b> groups in some molecular phylogenies.

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the deep open casts with the {{powerful}} excavating-loading and transport equipment (the rope <b>excavating</b> machines). The {{purpose is to}} increase the effectiveness of excavating-loading works at the expense of application of <b>excavating</b> machines of large power, at the expense of rational placement of <b>excavating</b> machines with the diverse capacity of bucket in the working zone of open cast. The procedure to choose the make of <b>excavating</b> machine, which takes account of change of operating conditions of excavating-loading equipment with the deepening of open cast, has been developed. The rational conditions to apply the <b>excavating</b> machines with the diverse capacity of bucket have been substantiated. The recommendations to choose the make of <b>excavating</b> machine under the particular mine-technical conditions have been developed.

Based on site test data, the point of tangency of the rack pitch line of the bucket rod and the pitch circle of the crowd gear were determined as the rotating center and the dynamic model of working mechanism was derived; due to the change law of the current and voltage of the hoist motor, the <b>excavating</b> process sections was separated from the <b>excavating</b> trace; log spiral model {{was chosen as the}} fitting function, and according to the following three judgment rules: maximizing soil volume in bucket, rationalizing the <b>excavating</b> time and minimizing the energy consumption of unit mass of soil in bucket, the optimal <b>excavating</b> trace was obtained and provided basis for the operation and design of the large mining shovel...|$|R

5|$|Palmyra's first {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} in 1902 by Otto Puchstein and in 1917 by Theodor Wiegand. In 1929, French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he <b>excavated</b> the Agora. Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO <b>excavated</b> the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been <b>excavated</b> by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities, and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski (until 1980) and Michael Gawlikowski (until 2011). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Scraping and <b>excavating</b> parrotfishes {{are well}} known for their marked {{differences}} in jaw morphology and feeding behaviour. Despite the importance of parrotfishes to reef systems and the well-known differences within the group, few studies have compared the functional importance of scraping versus <b>excavating</b> parrotfishes in shaping coral reef benthic communities. We compared the abundance, depth and dynamics of scraping and <b>excavating</b> parrotfish grazing scars on massive Porites spp. colonies along a reef gradient at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. Scraping grazing scars were more abundant at most study sites than <b>excavating</b> scars. <b>Excavating</b> grazing scars were relatively rare but exposed more coral skeleton than scraping scars. Approximately 70 % of <b>excavating</b> scars had some degree of filamentous algal growth in the scar compared with just 5 % of scraping scars. Scraping grazing scars on massive Porites spp. completely disappeared after 2 mo whereas <b>excavating</b> grazing scars remained almost unchanged over this period. Groups of <b>excavating</b> scars were more tightly clustered, exposed more coral skeleton and presented higher algal cover than grouped scraping scars. The deep, long-lasting <b>excavating</b> scars probably provide more suitable sites for the settlement of benthic algae and other invasive taxa on coral colonies. In contrast, the abundant and frequent grazing scars of scraping parrotfish may represent a more constant drain on energy supplies for coral colonies. These results highlight the differences between parrotfishes with distinct feeding modes and indicate that they differently impact not only algal communities but also coral colonies...|$|R

50|$|Certain <b>excavates</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} among the most primitive eukaryotes, based partly on their placement in many evolutionary trees. This could encourage proposals that <b>excavates</b> are a paraphyletic grade that includes the ancestors of other living eukaryotes. However, the placement of certain <b>excavates</b> as 'early branches' may be an analysis artifact caused by long branch attraction, as has been seen with some other groups, for example, microsporidia.|$|R
