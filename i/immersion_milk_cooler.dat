40|$|In {{this study}} the energy {{consumption}} of <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems for sheep milk was quantified, depending on number of milkings and performance class. The {{aim was to}} produce updated data about the incidence of energy consumption for <b>milk</b> <b>cooling,</b> useful for energy auditing research in livestock. The cost in electricity bills and the weight on the current price of sheep milk were calculated. The experimental work was carried out on 22 <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems in Sardinia, equipped with open-type tank and direct expansion system. A performance test was performed to determine the cooling time, monitoring the <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> energy consumption simultaneously. Factors affecting energy consumption were identified, such {{as the number of}} milkings, power/volume ratio and performance class. The average energy consumption was 1. 795 kWh/ 100 l for two milkings and 2. 427 kWh/ 100 l for four milkings tanks. The energy consumption for storage of <b>cooled</b> <b>milk</b> was estimated averagely 0. 120 kWh/ 100 l. Malfunctioning systems in the sample consumed averagely 26 % more than those with regular cooling time. The electricity cost for cooling accounts for 0. 63 % on the current price of sheep milk. The study highlights the need for regular maintenance in old tanks and a modernisation of <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems in sheep breeding farms in Sardinia, influenced by the introduction of a milk quality payment scheme, taking into account the importance of a correct and fast cooling process...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{variations}} in dairy farm electricity costs across five electricity tariffs. The effect of four <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> scenarios is also simulated to illustrate the effect of technologies on the electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of a dairy farm. Helping dairy farmers to make informed business decisions when confronted with future options in the sphere of electricity tariffs and energy efficient cooling systems will contribute to optimum farm profitability and will help to improve the profitability and sustainability of the industry. A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of dairy farms was used to simulate five electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff 1 (TOU 1), TOU 2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on a dairy farm with 195 milking cows. The Flat tariff consisted on one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09 : 00 to 00 : 00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a third peak price band was introduced between 17 : 00 and 19 : 00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations is a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment under the following headings; <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. Direct expansion, ice bank and pre-cooling <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems were simulated to determine how dairy farm electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions vary according to the <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system installed on the farm. Annual simulated electricity consumption of the farm was 32, 670 kWh when a direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system without pre-cooling of milk was included in the model. The annual electricity consumption of the farm on the day & night tariff was € 4, 571. Adding precooling with ground water to the direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system reduced annual electricity consumption by 28 % to 23, 660 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 38 % to € 2, 875. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system saved 3, 973 kg of CO 2. Simulation of an ice bank <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system without pre-cooling resulted in annual simulated electricity consumption of 34, 777 kWh. The annual electricity consumption on the day & night tariff was € 3, 793. Adding pre-cooling with ground water to the ice bank <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system reduced annual electricity consumption by 30 % to 24, 181 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 33 % to € 2, 527. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the ice bank <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system saved 5, 044 kg of CO 2...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{electric}} energy consumption of milking process on dairy farms and to evaluate the methods to improve the energy efficiency.

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the sector occurred in the early 1990 and the globalization of markets have presented a series of injunctions to the productive milk chain, particularly in the primary production stage, imposing to the organizations the need of a wide reformulation of their structures and strategies {{in order to keep}} such organisms themselves either active and competitive. This study aims to present the experiences of associative organizations of dairy farmers of six rural communities of the State of Minas Gerais, which have been adopting the system of purchasing and use of communitarian <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> tanks. The methodology consisted in the utilization of qualitative and quantitative research methods through an exploratory study, a descriptive approach and a comparative multicase study.

Out of the motivational variables indicating the associative behavior which have most discriminated the communities it stand out the demand for the dairy plant, the power of bargain in milk price and in the purchase of inputs, the reduction of the transportation cost and the commitment to the MAPA guidelines.

As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|R
