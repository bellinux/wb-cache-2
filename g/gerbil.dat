5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld <b>gerbil</b> in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld <b>gerbil</b> does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of <b>gerbil</b> that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E

Gap-detection thresholds of old <b>gerbils</b> were significantly elevated at 30 dB SL and 50 dB SPL as compared with young <b>gerbils.</b> Compared with young <b>gerbils</b> tested at 30 dB SL and 50 dB SPL, the distribution of gap-detection thresholds in old <b>gerbils</b> was broader with a spread to higher gap-detection thresholds. Some old animals retained excellent temporal resolution, while some showed impaired gap detection. The gap-detection data collected in young and old <b>gerbils</b> resemble previously published data from humans of different age and confirm that <b>gerbils</b> are a useful model to study age-dependent changes in temporal processing...|$|R

40|$|A coiled {{stainless}} steel wire clip was made that allowed us to chronically reduce cerebral blood flow in Mongolian <b>gerbils.</b> After 6 weeks of reduced cerebral blood flow in 15 experimental <b>gerbils,</b> we evaluated their learning ability and {{found it to be}} impaired relative to that in 15 control <b>gerbils.</b> Eight weeks after surgery, regional cerebral blood flow in the parietal cortex measured by the hydrogen clearance method in the experimental <b>gerbils</b> was 73 - 76 % of that in the control <b>gerbils.</b> Light microscopy showed minimal histologic changes in the brains of the experimental <b>gerbils.</b> Concentrations of brain proteins analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that among water-soluble brain proteins, the concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins (microtubule-associated protein 2, calspectin, and clathrin) declined in the experimental <b>gerbils.</b> In particular, the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2 declined significantly. Our findings show that the reduction of cerebral blood flow via carotid stenosis impairs the learning behavior in <b>gerbils,</b> with an associated decrease in the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2. We believe that Mongolian <b>gerbils</b> with chronically reduced cerebral blood flow are a useful animal model of chronic brain hypoperfusion. (Stroke 1990; 21 : 1205 - 1209...|$|R
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the <b>gerbil</b> or fennec fox, birds such as the desert lark or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} of two experiments, running-wheel {{activity}} and unsignaled (Sidman) avoidance were studied in <b>gerbils</b> and albino rats.

The <b>gerbils</b> displayed no warm-up, with shocks being evenly distributed over the session. Warm-up in the rats was not related to either response rate or to how effectively the animal was avoiding.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of toxic O 2 metabolites to cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury {{has not been}} determined. We found that <b>gerbils</b> subjected to temporary unilateral carotid artery occlusion (ischemia) consistently developed neurologic deficits during ischemia with severities that correlated with increasing degrees of brain edema and brain H 2 O 2 levels after reperfusion. In contrast, <b>gerbils</b> treated just before reperfusion (after ischemia) with dimethylthiourea (DMTU), but not urea, had decreased brain edema and brain H 2 O 2 levels. In addition, <b>gerbils</b> fed a tungsten-rich diet for 4, 5, or 6 wk developed progressive decreases in brain xanthine oxidase (XO) and brain XO + xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) activities, brain edema, and brain H 2 O 2 levels after temporary unilateral carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion. In contrast to tungsten-treated <b>gerbils,</b> allopurinol-treated <b>gerbils</b> did not have statistically significant decreases in brain XO or XO + XD levels, and reduced brain edema and brain H 2 O 2 levels occurred only in <b>gerbils</b> developing mild but not severe neurologic deficits during ischemia.

40|$|Background: Obesity {{induced by}} high-fat diet (HFD) {{is one of}} the most {{widespread}} metabolic disorders in current society. How-ever, there has been little research regarding the effects of HFD-induced obesity in the septa of animal models of cerebral isch-emia. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated septal effects of HFD on neuronal damage and gliosis induced by transient cerebral ischemia. Methods: Body weight, blood glucose levels and serum lipid profiles levels were measured both in the normal diet (ND) and HFD-group. We also investigated the effects of ND and HFD on neuronal damage and gliosis in the septum after transient cerebral ischemia using immunohistochemistry. Results: The levels of blood glucose, serum triglyceride, and total cholesterol were significantly increased in the HFD-fed <b>gerbils</b> compared with the ND-fed <b>gerbils,</b> although body weight was not significantly changed after HFD feeding.

50|$|Mongolian <b>gerbils</b> {{prefer to}} live in pairs or groups rather than alone. They are social and gentle, and do not bite readily. As diggers and tunnel-makers they are better suited to a tank with a deep {{substrate}} rather than a hamster cage, since the absorbent substrate is liable to be kicked {{up and out of}} a cage pretty quickly. <b>Gerbils</b> are also chewers and need plenty of cardboard items and chew toys. Cardboard will be chewed up into bedding and mixed with the substrate. <b>Gerbils</b> do not need fresh food and indeed it can give them diarrhea, a diet based on a seed, millet and alfalfa pellet mix is sufficient. Water should be provided in a drip-feed system to prevent the accidental build-up of harmful molds in the tank environment. Although <b>gerbils</b> are desert-adapted, they do require water to be supplied at all times. Care should be taken not to introduce new smells suddenly into the tank, which is considered by the <b>gerbils</b> to be their territory. <b>Gerbils</b> are active and appreciate a running or exercise wheel. Repetitive corner digging can be minimized by providing tunnels while <b>gerbils</b> are in their formative months. As with most animals, they appreciate a secure, private area that is dark for sleeping.|$|R
