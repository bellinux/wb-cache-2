The Wright engine/propeller combination proved excessively noisy and was replaced in later K-ships with slightly modified Pratt & Whitney engines. The K-3 cost $325,000. A series of orders for more K-class blimps followed. Twenty-one additional blimps (K-9 through K-30) were ordered on 14 October 1942.

40|$|Large sparse {{symmetric}} matrix problems arise {{in a number}} of scientific and engineering fields such as fluid mechanics, structural engineering, finite element analysis and network analysis. In all such problems, the performance of solvers depends critically on the sum of the row bandwidths of the matrix, a quantity known as <b>envelope</b> <b>size.</b> This can be reduced by appropriately reordering the rows and columns of the matrix, but for an (Formula presented.) matrix, there are (Formula presented.) such permutations, {{and it is difficult to}} predict how each permutation affects the <b>envelope</b> <b>size</b> without actually performing the reordering of rows and columns. These two facts compounded with the large values of (Formula presented.) used in practical applications, make the problem of minimising the <b>envelope</b> <b>size</b> of a matrix an exceptionally hard one. Several methods have been developed to reduce the <b>envelope</b> <b>size.</b> These methods are mainly heuristic in nature and based on graph-theoretic concepts.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{theory was}} developed, tying the {{hydrogen}} production rate of a comet to its visual light curve. Two unknown constants, which are essentially the efficiencies {{of these two}} processes, are derived from the comets for which quantitative data exist. This theory {{has been applied to}} P/Halley, using the light curve of Yeomans, which was derived from the original 1910 observations, with aperture corrections applied. Given the hydrogen production rate, it is assumed that N(H 20) = 0. 5 N(H) and that there is 0. 2 N(H 20) of other species. From several converging lines of evidence the mass of dust is taken as half the mass of gas. The Sekanina-Miller distribution function of particle size is used. Particle velocities are calculated using Delsemmes version of the Probstein theory. From these, near nucleus dust density, flux, etc. are calculated.

40|$|Infrared imaging {{properties}} of dusty winds around late-type stars are investigated in detail, employing a self-consistent model that couples the {{equations of motion}} and radiative transfer. Because of general scaling properties, the angular profiles of surface brightness are self-similar. In any given star, the profile shape is determined essentially by overall optical depth at each wavelength and it is self-similarly scaled {{by the size of}} the dust condensation zone. We find that mid-IR is the best wavelength range to directly measure the angular size of this zone, and from IRAS data we identify the 15 best candidates for such future observations. We also show that the visibility function at short wavelengths (< 2 microns) directly determines the scattering optical depth, and produce theoretical visibility curves for various characteristic wavelengths and the entire parameter range relevant to late-type stars. The infrared emission should display time variability because of cyclical changes in overall optical depth, reflecting luminosity-induced movement of the dust condensation point.
