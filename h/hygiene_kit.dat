40|$|A {{qualitative}} inquiry {{was used}} to assess if incentives consisting of a <b>hygiene</b> <b>kit,</b> protein-fortified flour, and delivery kit reduced barriers to antenatal care and delivery services in Nyanza Province, Kenya. We conducted 40 interviews (baseline: five nurses, six mothers, one focus group of five mothers; follow-up: nine nurses, 19 mothers) to assess perceptions of these services. Mothers and nurses identified poor quality of care, fear of HIV diagnosis and stigma, inadequate transport, and cost of care as barriers. Nurses believed incentives encouraged women to use services; mothers described wanting good birth outcomes as their motivation. While barriers to care did not change during the study, incentives may have increased service use. These findings suggest that structural improvements-upgraded infrastructure, adequate staffing, improved treatment of women by nurses, low or no-cost services, and provision of transport-could increase satisfaction with and use of services, improving maternal and infant health.

40|$|Integration of immunizations with hygiene {{interventions}} {{may improve}} use of both interventions. We interviewed 1361 intervention and 1139 comparison caregivers about hygiene practices and vaccination history, distributed water treatment and hygiene kits to caregivers during infant vaccination sessions in intervention clinics for 12 months, and conducted a followup survey of 2361 intervention and 1033 comparison caregivers. We observed {{significant increases in}} reported household water treatment (30 % vs 44 %, P,. 0001) and correct handwashing technique (25 % vs 51 %, P,. 0001) in intervention households and no changes in comparison households. Immunization coverage improved in both intervention and comparison infants (57 % vs 66 %, P 5. 04; 37 % vs 53 %, P,. 0001, respectively). <b>Hygiene</b> <b>kit</b> distribution during routine immunizations positively impacted household water treatment and hygiene without {{a negative impact on}} vaccination coverage.

However, most of denture wearers had never been instructed on how to perform daily oral/denture care. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the influence of a guidance material associated or not to the provision of hygiene devices and its effect on the habits of denture wearers. Forty- eight complete denture wearers were randomly divided into three groups. Group N received no guidance on how to clean and wear their dentures, group G received an illustrated leaflet and verbal complementary instructions and group GK received the same guidance as group G and a <b>hygiene</b> <b>kit</b> for denture cleaning. After a six to ten week period they responded to a ‘hygiene and wearing habits’ questionnaire. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis considering p < 0. 05. Brushing was the most frequent cleaning method, the majority of groups N and G used toothpaste. Participants of group G and GK presented low percentages of individuals with hygiene and wearing routine considered improper. The differences between groups in hygiene and wearing routine were statistically significant (p < 0. 001).
