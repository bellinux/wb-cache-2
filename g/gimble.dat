25|$|In 1970, Haggard {{released}} A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills), {{rounding up}} {{six of the}} remaining members of the Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny <b>Gimble,</b> and Alex Brashear. Merle's band, the Strangers, were also present during the recording, but Wills suffered a massive stroke after {{the first day of}} recording. Merle arrived on the second day, devastated that he would not get to record with him, but the album helped return Wills to public consciousness, and set off a Western swing revival. Haggard did other tribute albums to Bob Wills over the next 40 years. In 1973 he appeared on For the Last Time: Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. In 1994, Haggard collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album entitled A Tribute To The Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. A Tribute was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995.|$|E

The album was produced by Jimmy Bowen and Strait. In 1992 Entertainment Weekly Alanna Nash regarded the album as Strait's [...] "most hard-core country album" [...] {{up to that point}} in his career. Allmusic staff noted that the album held its own at the time of release against most of its competitors and has aged better than most country music albums. Ralph Novak, Lisa Shea, Eric Levin, and Craig Tomashoff of People said the album represents the most straightforward style of singing. The iTunes Store describes the album {{as the result of a}} transition in eras of country music.|$|E

50|$|In 1934, the {{original}} Lawn-Boy lawn mower was manufactured by the Evinrude Company, {{becoming the first}} one-handed reel power mower introduced to the American public. Evinrude purchased Johnson Motor Wheel Company from a New York stock brokerage firm a year later, and in 1936 they merged with the Outboard Marine and Manufacturing Company (OMC), continuing production of Lawn-Boy mowers until 1939, when it was temporarily put on hold to manufacture outboard motors for World War II. In 1946 and after the war, Joel G. (Jack) Doyle built the first rotary lawnmower for the Rotary Power Mower Company of Kansas City, Missouri. Doyle accumulated orders for these mowers from Sears Roebuck, <b>Gimbles,</b> Spiegel, and other businesses. OMC then bought RPM in 1952, and changed the brand of the rotary lawn mower to the Lawn-Boy name.|$|R

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} a {{rendezvous}} and docking system using an image dissector detector as compared to a GaAs detector were discussed. Investigation into a <b>gimbled</b> scanning system is also covered and the measured video response curves from the image dissector camera are presented. Rendezvous will occur at ranges greater than 100 meters. The maximum range considered was 1000 meters. During docking, the range, range-rate, angle, and angle-rate to each reflector on the satellite must be measured. Docking range will be from 3 to 100 meters. The system consists of a CW laser diode transmitter and an image dissector receiver. The transmitter beam is amplitude modulated with three sine wave tones for ranging. The beam is coaxially combined with the receiver beam. Mechanical deflection of the transmitter beam, + or - 10 degrees in both X and Y, can be accomplished before or after it is combined with the receiver beam. The receiver will have a field-of-view (FOV) of 20 degrees and an instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) of two milliradians (mrad) and will be electronically scanned in the image dissector. The increase in performance obtained from the GaAs photocathode is not needed to meet the present performance requirements...|$|R

50|$|Jiagge {{was awarded}} the Grand Medal of Ghana and the <b>Gimbles</b> International Award for Humanitarian Works in 1969. She was named a judge of the Court of Appeal that same year, the highest court in Ghana at the time. She was the first female judge of the Court of Appeal. She was awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Ghana in 1974. In 1975, she founded the Ghana National Council on Women and Development and was its first chair. As chair, she convened a meeting of Ghanaian women to learn their views on Equality, Development and Peace, {{the theme of the}} 1975 International Women's Conference in Mexico. She learned that access to credit was a {{priority}} for her country's women and led Ghana's delegation to the conference. She and others pledged seed money for a women's bank and the organisation Stitching to Promote Women's World Banking (now Women's World Banking) was founded and headquartered in New York. She later served on the board of Women's World Banking in Ghana. Jiagge also served as a president of the World Council of Churches from 1975 to 1983.

40|$|Photograph of a Quadra/Motion {{billboard}} in Los Angeles, 1981. This three dimentional, animated billboard is lit by {{high intensity}} lights. Six four sided piramids are <b>gimbled</b> to fold and refold {{against each other}} creating a six surfaced area. The folding part of the sign is shown in its partially rotated or changing position. The surface shown is illustrated {{with a bottle of}} gin a glass with a cherry in it and gth lettering "Gibley's Gin". Lettering on The left side of the billboard is roman using bold, medium and a light type face. The top line Mix Well-Mix With is a light upper and lower case letter on a narrow dark dark panel with rounded ends. "Gibley's" is a dark medium weight letter on the light background. The next line is most likely a different colored light panel (different from the background color) similar to the top pannel with a light roman letter. This line consists of the words of "Gin-Vodka-Rum". The billboard was designed in Quadra/Motion by motion marketing international and manufactured by heath & Co. who probably own the billboard and rent the location on a monthly lease to gilbey's gin. A hand lettered billboard this size in 1979 would rent for one thousand dollars a month, some locations in Los Angeles such as Sunset Boulevard would cost more. Photoprint reads: "This is most likely a free standing sign at a busy intersection (because their are two signs at an odd angle) such as Santa Monica Boulevard and Westwood Boulevard"...|$|R
40|$|Phased-array {{antenna systems}} offer many {{advantages}} to low-Earth-orbiting satellite systems. Their large scan angles and multibeam capabilities allow for vibration-free, rapid beam scanning and graceful degradation operation for high rate downlink {{of data to}} users on the ground. Technology advancements continue to reduce the power, weight, and cost of these systems to make phased arrays a competitive alternative {{in comparison to the}} <b>gimbled</b> reflector system commonly used in science missions. One effort to reduce the cost of phased arrays is the development of a Ka-band multibeam aperture (MBA) phased array by Boeing Corporation under a contract jointly by the NASA Glenn Research Center and the Office of Naval Research. The objective is to develop and demonstrate a space-qualifiable dual-beam Ka-band (26. 5 -GHz) phased-array antenna. The goals are to advance {{the state of the art}} in Ka-band active phased-array antennas and to develop and demonstrate multibeam transmission technology compatible with spacecraft in low Earth orbit to reduce the cost of future missions by retiring certain development risks. The frequency chosen is suitable for space-to-space and space-to-ground communication links. The phased-array antenna has a radiation pattern designed by combining a set of individual radiating elements, optimized with the type of radiating elements used, their positions in space, and the amplitude and phase of the currents feeding the elements. This arrangement produces a directional radiation pattern that is proportional to the number of individual radiating elements. The arrays of interest here can scan the main beam electronically with a computerized algorithm. The antenna is constructed using electronic components with no mechanical parts, and the steering is performed electronically, without any resulting vibration. The speed of the scanning is limited primarily by the control electronics. The radiation performance degrades gracefully if a portion of the elements fail. The arrays can be constructed to conform to a mounting surface, and multibeam capability is integral to the design. However, there are challenges for mission designers using monolithic-microwave-integrated-circuit- (MMIC-) based arrays because of reduced power efficiency, higher costs, and certain system effects that result in link degradations. The multibeam aperture phased-array antenna development is attempting to address some of these issues, particularly manufacturing, costs, and system performance...|$|R
