25|$|In most cases, a {{domestic}} partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership {{has not been}} in force {{for more than five}} years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.|$|E

500|$|Following Simpson's divorce {{hearing on}} 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became {{concerned}} {{that there would}} be a [...] "patriotic" [...] citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.|$|E
