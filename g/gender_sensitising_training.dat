40|$|Trade in {{services}} {{has played a}} pivotal role in boosting economic growth of India. However, very few studies exist that trace its gender differential impacts. This study makes a pioneering attempt to estimate the impact of exports of services on gender employment in 46 sectors, which include 15 services sectors. Social Accounting Matrix has been used to generate gender employment multipliers and identify sectors where higher exports of services may lead to greater gender employment equality. Further, a primary survey is undertaken to capture the gender differential impact of trade in Information and Technology Enabled Services. Policy implications to <b>gender</b> <b>sensitise</b> trade policy are derived from the results. ...|$|R
40|$|Gender Studies {{have reached}} their {{institutionalised}} status at {{universities in the}} Netherlands by working along the tracks of integration and autonomy. The first track consisted of integrating gender into existing monodisciplinary science and scholarship in order to <b>gender</b> <b>sensitise</b> them. The second track entailed setting up a discipline of one’s own. Women’s Studies, now Gender Studies, built feminist academic infrastructures, and did so in multi and interdisciplinary veins. Early feminist academics at Dutch universities were recent graduates. Such young teachers, their students, and their shared questions were crucial for Women’s Studies to develop. Nowadays, Dutch Gender Studies are characterised by an ‘integrated autonomy’, given that many feminist stakes have {{been taken over by}} the mainstream. Multi and interdisciplinarity in particular are no longer special at all! They are governmental and university policies. This article asks to what extent encounters with a diverse student body in broad bachelor programmes such as Liberal Arts and Liberal Arts and Sciences assist in ensuring that academic feminism does not lose its critical edge. Such programmes embrace critical and creative reflection on academia because students are to discover or develop their scholarly interests while studying. Given integrated autonomy, feminist teaching, learning, and research can only gain from a diverse student population...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of male obesity is increasing alongside low uptake of existing weight management programmes by men. Football Fans in Training (FFIT) is a group-based, weight management and healthy living programme delivered by community coaches. Objectives: To assess (1) the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FFIT, (2) fidelity of delivery and (3) coach and participant experiences of FFIT. Design: A two-arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial; associated cost-effectiveness [in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) within trial and over individuals’ lifetimes]; and process evaluation. Participants were block randomised in a 1 [*]:[*] 1 ratio, stratified by club; {{the intervention group}} started FFIT within 3 weeks and the comparison group were put on a 12 -month waiting list. Setting: Thirteen professional football clubs in Scotland, UK. Participants: A total of 747 men aged 35 – 65 years with an objectively measured body mass index (BMI) of &# 8805;[*] 28 [*]kg/m 2. Interventions: FFIT was <b>gender</b> <b>sensitised</b> in context, content and style of delivery. A total of 12 weekly sessions delivered at club stadia combined effective behaviour change techniques with dietary information and physical activity sessions. Men carried out a pedometer-based walking programme. A light-touch maintenance programme included six e-mails and a reunion session at 9 months. At baseline, both groups received a weight management booklet, feedback on their BMI and advice to consult their general practitioner if blood pressure was high. Primary outcome: Mean difference in weight loss between groups at 12 months expressed as absolute weight and a percentage. Intention-to-treat analyses used all available data. Data sources: Objective measurements, questionnaires, observations, focus groups and coach interviews. Results: A total of 374 men were allocated to the intervention and 333 (89...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lifestyle {{interventions}} targeting physical activity, sedentary {{time and}} dietary behaviours {{have the potential}} to initiate and support behavioural change and result in public health gain. Although men have often been reluctant to engage in such lifestyle programs, many are at high risk of several chronic conditions. We have developed an evidence and theory-based, <b>gender</b> <b>sensitised,</b> health and lifestyle program (European Fans in Training (EuroFIT)), which is designed to attract men through the loyalty they feel to the football club they support. This paper describes the study protocol to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the EuroFIT program in supporting men to improve their level of physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour over 12  months. Methods The EuroFIT study is a pragmatic, two-arm, randomised controlled trial conducted in 15 football clubs in the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK (England). One-thousand men, aged 30 to 65  years, with a self-reported Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 27  kg/m 2 will be recruited and individually randomised. The primary outcomes are objectively-assessed changes in total physical activity (steps per day) and total sedentary time (minutes per day) at 12  months after baseline assessment. Secondary outcomes are weight, BMI, waist circumference, resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardio-metabolic blood biomarkers, food intake, self-reported physical activity and sedentary time, wellbeing, self-esteem, vitality and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed and a process evaluation conducted. The EuroFIT program will be delivered over 12 weekly, 90 -minute sessions that combine classroom discussion with graded physical activity in the setting of the football club. Classroom sessions provide participants with a toolbox of behaviour change techniques to initiate and sustain long-term lifestyle changes. The coaches will receive two days of training to enable them to create a positive social environment that supports men in engaging in sustained behaviour change. Discussion The EuroFIT trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the EuroFIT program delivered by football clubs to their male fans, and will offer insight into factors associated with success in making sustained changes to physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and secondary outcomes, such as diet.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{morbidity}} and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) are increasing in many African countries. Research and implementation of public health nutrition programmes in the developed world have shown that CVD can be prevented by dietary interventions. The objectives of this paper are to (i) review the relationships between diet and CVD; (ii) review the possible contribution of the nutrition transition, which is associated with economic development and “modernisation” to CVD in Africa; (iii) identify barriers and challenges plus assessing the opportunities available to steer the nutrition transition into a more positive direction; and (iv) show how ideal nutrient intakes can be translated into appropriate food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) and how to apply these for prevention and management of CVDs. This should result in appropriate recommendations for diets that will be country-specific, affordable, culturally acceptable and based on available, traditional and indigenous foods. It is concluded that all health professionals should be <b>sensitised,</b> informed, <b>trained</b> and/or educated to apply FBDGs {{in a way that will}} motivate the public or patients to follow healthier diets for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and treatment of CVD...|$|R
40|$|Events such as {{worsening}} droughts, flooding, global warming, {{poverty and}} famine, civil unrest, humanitarian crisis, {{and human rights}} violations which now characterise human existence are proof enough that passivity {{is no longer an}} option, and certainly not an option for higher education; all must stand and be counted for their contributions towards a more sustainable world. Higher education has over the years been seen as an agent for addressing the problems of sustainability, and the curriculum is regarded as a critical tool for delivering related educational objectives. The research reported in this article is an attempt to determine the degree of attention to sustainability present in the curriculum of the Higher National Diploma (HND) Purchasing and Supply Management programme in Ghana, and also to ascertain the nature of sustainability issues addressed by the curriculum. Documentary research is the methodology used in conducting this study. Findings of the study suggest that sustainability has a low presence in the curriculum. A greater proportion of the sustainability sub-topics in the curriculum addressed issues of social justice, while economic sustainability issues featured the least. More deliberate and greater effort is recommenced to integrate sustainability in the curriculum, and also <b>sensitise</b> and <b>train</b> all relevant stakeholders in issues of sustainability...|$|R
40|$|The health {{among men}} and women with {{same-sex}} sexuality experience, i. e. attraction to and/or sexual relations with someone of the same sex, in Sub-Saharan Africa is an increasing public health concern. Prior research on {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) has demonstrated that their healthcare utilisation is limited due to stigma and discrimination. However, little is known about the extent to which the healthcare needs of persons with same-sex sexuality are being met, and if unmet needs exist, what could be done to meet this challenge. Thus, the general aim of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of healthcare-seeking behaviours and unmet healthcare needs among persons with same-sex sexuality in Tanzania and Uganda. A multifaceted approach was employed, including quantitative cross-sectional and qualitative interview studies. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews with 12 self-identified MSM carried out in 2012 (Study I), a survey study among 570 university students with same-sex sexuality experience carried out in Uganda 2010 (Study II), a survey study of 296 MSM recruited through respondent-driven sampling carried out in two cities in Tanzania in 2012, 2013, respectively (Study III), and 16 in-depth interviews with pharmacy workers carried out in Tanzania 2016 (Study IV). Qualitative content analysis and grounded theory were used for the analyses of the interview transcripts in Study I and Study IV, logistic regression analysis was used in Study II, and population proportions in Study III were estimated through RDS Analyst. Study I revealed that a multi-layered stigma shaped men’s perceptions and experiences of healthcare services, which resulted in delay or avoidance of services as well as self-treatment. Study II showed that unmet healthcare needs and unmet needs for sexual health counselling services were associated with poor mental health and exposure to sexual coercion among students with experience of same-sex sexuality. Study III showed that RDS networks were significantly larger in size in the larger city with more specialised networks compared to the smaller city. Despite this, a larger number of seeds, or initial recruiters, were not required in the smaller city to achieve minimum sample size for recruitment purposes. The qualitative findings from Study IV revealed that pharmacy workers perceived themselves as being involved in a transition process from having limited engagement in the care of MSM clients to becoming regular service-providers to this group. Transgression of provider-client boundaries and financial interests emerged as underlying factors for unauthorised and incomplete drug provision. All in all, this thesis suggests that persons with same-sex sexuality in Uganda and Tanzania have healthcare needs that are not currently being met. Given the efforts to control HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) in these settings, adequate healthcare provision for these groups is of the utmost importance. The findings of this thesis suggest that there is a need for specialised services that provide places free of discrimination, and with <b>sensitised</b> providers <b>trained</b> to meet the physical and psychological health needs of persons with same-sex sexuality. Social networks should be used not only to disseminate HIV/STI prevention messages but also to encourage healthcare-seeking by providing information about available services. However, in light of current punitive legislation against homosexuality in both countries, governments need to carefully review how the laws impact on the healthcare-seeking and healthcare needs of same-sex sexuality populations. Since many same-sex practising {{men and women}} also have sexual relations with the general population, the health of persons with same-sex sexuality should be viewed as a general public health matter...|$|R
