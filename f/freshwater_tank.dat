40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{concentration}} of H 2 S in groundwater {{is a significant}} problem in various areas across Canada. Hydrogen sulphide dissolves in ground water imparting undesirable taste and irritating rotten egg smell which makes it unpalatable. Ingestion of sulphides through drinking water can result in stomach discomfort, nausea and vomiting. Humans exposed to high concentrations of H 2 S for prolonged periods show symptoms of gastro-intestinal upset, anorexia, nausea, somnolence, amnesia, loss of consciousness, delirium, hallucinations, difficulty in swallowing, low blood pressure, slowing of heart rate, double vision and epileptiform convulsions. Hydrogen sulphide in blood is rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen and thus reduces the oxidation power of haemoglobin. Unoxidized hydrogen sulphide can act upon {{the central nervous system}} and cause either paralysis or respiratory failure. It is therefore, necessary to have a very low {{concentration of}} H 2 S in the water. Approach: An automatic system for the addition of KMnO 4 and removal of hydrogen sulphide from ground water was developed and tested. The system consisted of a <b>freshwater</b> <b>tank,</b> a pump, a chemical storage tank, a solenoid valve, a photocell and electronic circuit, a drainage tank, a filter and a set of valves.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{experimentally}} determine the differences between four grazing treatments on the trampling of nests. Additionally, we examine to what extent the trampling probability of nests is higher close to a source of fresh water. We compare the trampling of artificial nests in five different grazing treatments in an experimental design. We use buried clay pigeon targets as artificial mimics of bird nests to obtain reliable estimates of trampling risk and compare these with real nests. We find that horses trample significantly more artificial nests than cattle resulting in lower survival rates of artificial nests under horse grazing than under cattle grazing. For both horses and cattle, we find a clear trend, approaching significance, towards more trampling at higher numbers of livestock. We found that more artificial nests are trampled closer to a <b>freshwater</b> <b>tank.</b> The survival probability of artificial nests in cattle grazed treatments in this study is found to be in the same range as real nests in the study area and very close to the survival probability of Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) nests under cattle grazing in a different system. We recommend that horses should not be used as grazers for management purposes in areas with high densities of birds' nests in order to minimize the risk of nests being trampled. Additionally, we confirm that the location of freshwater tanks has an important effect on the distribution of livestock and hence on trampling of nests. ...|$|E
