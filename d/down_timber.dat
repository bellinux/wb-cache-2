5|$|Neville {{was present}} at the Council of Clarendon, where he was among the king's followers. Neville was one of the {{witnesses}} to the Constitutions of Clarendon, which came out of the Council. In 1166 he was named chief forester of the royal forests, an office that was responsible for the royal officials in charge of administrating the forests as well as the system of royal courts that enforced the forest law. Neville headed the royal efforts to enforce the forest law, which banned cutting <b>down</b> <b>timber,</b> clearing new farm fields, poaching, or the creation of enclosures within the royal forest. Any offences against the forest law were subject to monetary fines, which were an important source of royal revenue. The royal forest included not only the forests owned by the king, but also many forests on lands held by other persons. After Neville's appointment as chief forester, {{he was in charge of}} hearing offences against the forest law and also imposing punishments. His activities were resented by the people subject to forest law.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the best preserved prehistoric village ever found in the United Kingdom". The site covered an area of [...] north to south by [...] east to west. It was first constructed 250 B.C. by laying <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> and clay. Wooden houses and barns were then built on the clay base and occupied by up to 200 people at any time until the village was abandoned around 50 B.C.|$|E
500|$|In fact, {{the tunnels}} {{were to be}} {{excavated}} {{at a depth of}} more than [...] below the surface, the deepest of any on the London Underground. In his presentation to the joint committee, the CCE's counsel disparagingly refuted the objections: [...] "Just see what an absurd thing! Disturbance of the water when we are 240feet down in the London clay – about the most impervious thing you can possibly find; almost more impervious than granite rock! And the vibration on this railway is to shake <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> trees! Could anything be more ludicrous than to waste the time of the Committee in discussing such things presented by such a body!" ...|$|E
50|$|The other mines {{remained}} productive {{after the}} disaster in Mine No. 2. Then, on February 8, 1923, Stag Canyon Mine No. 1 suffered an explosion. A mine car derailed, knocking <b>down</b> <b>timbers</b> and the electric trolley cable causing sparks, igniting coal {{dust in the}} mine. 123 men were killed in this explosion, many of them offspring {{of the men who}} died in 1913.|$|R
50|$|An {{estimated}} 15% of its habitat {{has been}} lost through inundation for hydroelectric schemes and to fire over the past 100 years or so. Extensive logging {{in the past has}} removed nearly all large trees, but there is regrowth nearly everywhere. One stand of the species has been made available for access to craft wood from dead and <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> under a strict licensing system. It is illegal to cut living trees.|$|R
50|$|The Gibbon River is {{a popular}} trout fishing destination. The upper section of river has very {{difficult}} access being choked with thick forests and lots of <b>downed</b> <b>timber.</b> The fish, consisting of brook trout, rainbow trout and grayling, are all on the small side, rarely exceeding 10 in. Below Gibbon Falls access is excellent and the river has a healthy mix of rainbow and brown trout. The lower river receives a good run of spawning browns in the fall.|$|R

That any tenant seized of any {{estate of}} {{inheritance}} {{in any of the}} customary tenements of the said manor, may cut <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> trees or other trees, standing or growing in or upon one of his customary tenements, to repair any other of his customary tenements, within the said manor.|$|E
6000|$|When Hiram, king of Tyre, sent <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> {{cut from}} the cedars of Lebanon, to build the temple of God for Solomon; his heathen workmen, probably, were angry and terrified at what they were doing. They said among themselves--"These cedars belong to Baal, or to Melkart, the gods of Tyre. Our king {{has no right to}} send them to build the temple of Jehovah, the God of the Jews. It is a robbery, and a sacrilege; and Baal will be angry with us; and curse us with drought and blight." ...|$|E
6000|$|By degrees {{the gorge}} widened, grew more open, more genial. Aspen {{thickets}} of pale-gold flashed upon their eyes like sunlight, and grassy bunches afforded firmer footing, {{but on the}} slopes their feet slipped and slid painfully. Still Berea kept her stride. [...] "We must get to the middle fork before dark," [...] she stopped to explain, [...] "for I don't know the trail down there, and there's a lot of <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> just above the station. Now that we're cut loose from our camp I feel nervous. As long as I have a tent I am all right; but now {{we are in the}} open I worry. How are you standing it?" [...] She studied him with keen and anxious glance, her hand upon his arm.|$|E
50|$|The Menominee have {{traditionally}} practiced logging in a sustainable manner. In 1905, a tornado {{swept through the}} reservation, downing a massive amount of timber. Because the Menominee-owned sawmills could not harvest all the <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> before it decomposed, the United States Forest Service became involved in managing their forest. Despite {{the desire of the}} tribe and Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. for sustainable yield policy, the Forest Service conducted clear-cutting on reservation lands until 1926, cutting 70 percent of the salable timber.|$|R
50|$|The fungus is saprobic, {{and grows}} only on well-rotted wood of oak. It occurs on {{branches}} and trunks {{lying on the}} ground, and is more rarely seen on branches that are still attached to the tree. Found in northern Europe, and North America, {{it has also been}} recorded from Asia, including Japan and Taiwan. In terms of the classification of white rot fungi, X. frustulatus is a selective degrader, meaning that it breaks down lignin and hemicellulose faster than cellulose. The fungus is one of several known to break <b>down</b> <b>timbers</b> used in coal mines.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{following}} the Clinton Administration's refusal to reinstate the original terms of KPC's timber contract, Louisiana-Pacific Corp. {{announced it would}} be shutting <b>down</b> the <b>timber</b> mill, and did so in March 1997.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{was not of}} this mind. He was {{grateful}} for his father's forgiveness and assistance, and doubly so for the provision for his wife, hailing it as an unexpected and undeserved kindness. Lord Martindale was more pleased by his manner in their interview than ever he had been before. Still there were many difficulties: money was to be raised; and the choice between selling, mortgaging, or cutting <b>down</b> <b>timber,</b> seemed to go to Lord Martindale's heart. He had taken such pride in the well-doing of his estate! He wished to make further retrenchments in the stable and garden arrangements; but, as he told John, he knew not how to reduce the enormous expense of the latter without giving more pain to Lady Martindale than he could bear to inflict.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was a man}} of one idea:—that all {{civilisation}} was {{the painted}} fungus of rottenness. He hated any sign of culture. I won his respect one afternoon when he found me trespassing in the woods because I was watching some maggots at work in a dead rabbit. That led us to a discussion of life. He was a thorough materialist—he scorned religion and all mysticism. He spent his days sleeping, making intricate traps for weasels and men, putting together a gun, or doing some amateur forestry, cutting <b>down</b> <b>timber,</b> splitting it in logs for use in the hall, and planting young trees. When he thought, he reflected on the decay of mankind—the decline of the human race into folly and weakness and rottenness. [...] "Be a good animal, true to your animal instinct," [...] was his motto. With all this, he was fundamentally very unhappy—and he made me also wretched. It was this power to communicate his unhappiness that made me somewhat dear to him, I think. He treated me as an affectionate father treats a delicate son; I noticed he liked to {{put his hand on my}} shoulder or my knee as we talked; yet withal, he asked me questions, and saved his thoughts to tell me, and believed in my knowledge like any acolyte.|$|E
60|$|At Ayer-panas {{we had a}} {{comfortable}} house to stay in, and {{plenty of room to}} dry and preserve our specimens; but, owing to there being no industrious Chinese to cut <b>down</b> <b>timber,</b> insects were comparatively scarce, with the exception of butterflies, of which I formed a very fine collection. The manner in which I obtained one fine insect was curious, and indicates how fragmentary and imperfect a traveller's collection must necessarily be. I was one afternoon walking along a favourite road through the forest, with my gun, when I saw a butterfly on the ground. It was large, handsome, and quite new to me, and I got close to it before it flew away. I then observed that it had been settling on the dung of some carnivorous animal. Thinking it might return to the same spot, I next day after breakfast took my net, and as I approached the place was delighted to see the same butterfly sitting on the same piece of dung, and succeeded in capturing it. It was an entirely new species of great beauty, and has been named by Mr. Hewitson--Nymphalis calydona. I never saw another specimen of it, and it was only after twelve years had elapsed that a second individual reached this country from the northwestern part of Borneo.|$|E

60|$|So forth went {{these three}} brave men, Horatius, the Consul's nephew, Spurius Lartius, and Titus Herminius, {{to guard the}} bridge at the farther end, while {{all the rest of}} the warriors were {{breaking}} <b>down</b> the <b>timbers</b> behind them.|$|R

6000|$|Late in the afternoon, for we had lingered {{long on the}} island, {{we raised}} our sail for the first time, and for a short hour the {{southwest}} wind was our ally; {{but it did not}} please Heaven to abet us along. With one sail raised we swept slowly up {{the eastern side of the}} stream, steering clear of the rocks, while, from the top of a hill which formed the opposite bank, some lumberers were rolling <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> to be rafted down the stream. We could see their axes and levers gleaming in the sun, and the logs came down with a dust and a rumbling sound, which was reverberated through the woods beyond us on our side, like the roar of artillery. But Zephyr soon took us out of sight and hearing of this commerce. Having passed Read's Ferry, and another island called McGaw's Island, we reached some rapids called Moore's Falls, and entered on [...] "that section of the river, nine miles in extent, converted, by law, into the Union Canal, comprehending in that space six distinct falls; at each of which, and at several intermediate places, work has been done." [...] After passing Moore's Falls by means of locks, we again had recourse to our oars, and went merrily on our way, driving the small sandpiper from rock to rock before us, and sometimes rowing near enough to a cottage on the bank, though they were few and far between, to see the sunflowers, and the seed vessels of the poppy, like small goblets filled with the water of Lethe, before the door, but without disturbing the sluggish household behind. Thus we held on, sailing or dipping our way along with the paddle up this broad river, smooth and placid, flowing over concealed rocks, where we could see the pickerel lying low in the transparent water, eager to double some distant cape, to make some great bend as in the life of man, and see what new perspective would open; looking far into a new country, broad and serene, the cottages of settlers seen afar for the first time, yet with the moss of a century on their roofs, and the third or fourth generation in their shadows. Strange was it to consider how the sun and the summer, the buds of spring and the seared leaves of autumn, were related to these cabins along the shore; how all the rays which paint the landscape radiate from them, and the flight of the crow and the gyrations of the hawk have reference to their roofs. Still the ever rich and fertile shores accompanied us, fringed with vines and alive with small birds and frisking squirrels, the edge of some farmer's field or widow's wood-lot, or wilder, perchance, where the muskrat, the little medicine of the river, drags itself along stealthily over the alder-leaves and muscle-shells, and man and the memory of man are banished far.|$|E

50|$|The {{inhabitants}} were a warlike people, {{who paid}} more attention to cattle-breeding than to agriculture, although when the area became a Roman province, the Romans probably increased the fertility of the soil by draining the marshes and cutting <b>down</b> <b>timber.</b> Noric steel was famous for its quality and hardness.|$|E

5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|R
50|$|On April 27, 2011, {{the park}} was {{directly}} hit by an EF-2 tornado spawned from the same supercell thunderstorm that had {{earlier in the evening}} tracked across central Alabama, heavily damaging Tuscaloosa. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, and large parts of the park's camping areas and summit area were damaged. In the camping area, several cars and trucks were crushed by falling trees, however, no injuries were sustained. The park was re-opened to the public on May 6; however, large swaths of <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> remain, especially on the mountain's westernmost flank above 3,200 feet. Most park trails were re-opened on May 13, {{with the exception of the}} Ada-hi Falls Trail. A large section of wooden steps was crushed by fallen trees and will have to be replaced before the trail is re-opened.|$|R
5000|$|The parish of Ingleby Greenhow has {{records of}} a John Thomasson de Grenehow, {{a member of}} the clergy, who in 1376 [...] "had to appear before a Commission {{appointed}} to be tried with several others for either poaching or cutting <b>down</b> <b>timber,</b> or destroying property belonging to Peter de Malo Luca the 6th, of Mulgrave Castle".|$|E

50|$|As the Union Pacific Railroad {{was pushing}} west {{to link up}} with the Central Pacific Railroad, {{as part of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad, they sent logging crews into the Snowy Range, in the Medicine Bow Mountains, to cut <b>down</b> <b>timber</b> (mainly Lodgepole Pine) for {{railroad}} ties. A work camp was built {{on the site of the}} town. After they had completed most of their work and the workers started having conflicts with area Indians, the crews left the area. After the area was opened to homesteaders a few ranchers returned to the area.|$|E
5000|$|Slightly {{south of}} the St. Lawrence-Herkimer-Hamilton county marker stands what is (arguably) the largest virgin White Pine in the Adirondacks. Recent tree surveys have found one white pine {{standing}} at 144 feet tall, however, none over 150 feet tall have been found there yet. The virgin pine stand at Pine Ridge near the East Branch of the Oswegatchie is another well known spot where examples of original growth timber may be seen. However, portions of the Pine Ridge stand were completely blown down in the 1950 hurricane. Most of the remainder of Pine Ridge was destroyed in the blowdown of 1995. The Adirondack Park Agency ruled to leave the <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> untouched. Camp Johnny, a nearby rise of land and popular camping spot remained untouched. There is extreme blowdown in the Cat Mountain area and in the very remote and nearly untraveled Riley Ponds section of the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} as a semi-portable engine was the tank-bed engine. This replaced the flat lower frame with a deep, cast-iron 'bath tub'. This improved the rigidity of the frame, such that the engines could {{be placed on the}} very weakest foundations. Many of these engines, in colonial use, were merely staked <b>down</b> to <b>timber</b> baulks, rather than being built onto masonry.|$|R
40|$|Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) habitat on the {{northern}} portion of the Angelina National Forest is composed primarily of loblolly and shortleaf pine with a significant hardwood component, especially in the midstory. Intensive management of RCW habitat in Angelina National Forest in Texas is a priority for this endangered species. The research inventoried <b>downed</b> <b>timber</b> in endangered red-cockaded woodpecker clusters on the Angelina National Forest in Texas following Hurricane Rita and utilized a geographic information system to analyze and display data to assess RCW habitat. In the Bannister Wildlife Management Unit of the Angelina National Forest, pine trees either uprooted or snapped by Hurricane Rita in September 2005 were located and mapped to the nearest meter using either a Trimble ProXRS GPS Unit or a Juno™ ST handheld GPS unit. Data taken for each pine included diameter at 4. 5 feet, height of pine, height to limbs, crown width, species, direction of disturbance, cause of disturbance and associated insect and disease signs and symptoms...|$|R
