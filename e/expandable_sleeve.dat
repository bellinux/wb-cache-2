40|$|An all metal energy {{dissipator}} construction is disclosed for dissipating kinetic energy force (F) by rolling balls which are forced by a tapered surface on an <b>expandable</b> <b>sleeve</b> to frictionally load a force rod. The balls are maintained in an initial position by a plate member which is biased by a spring member. A spring member returns the force rod to its initial position after a loading force is removed...|$|E
