An <b>enumerative</b> <b>classification</b> contains {{a full set}} of entries for all concepts. A faceted classification system uses a set of semantically cohesive categories that are combined as needed to create an expression of a concept. In this way, the faceted classification is not limited to already defined concepts. While this makes the classification quite flexible, it also makes the resulting expression of topics complex. To the extent possible, facets represent [...] "clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive aspects, properties or characteristics of a class or specific subject". Some commonly used general-purpose facets are time, place, and form.|$|E

In 1885, they created Universal Bibliographic Repertory (Répertoire Bibliographique Universel) (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive classified index to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist Herbert Haviland Field who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the Concilium Bibliographicum. A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of Dewey Decimal Classification wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely <b>enumerative</b> <b>classification</b> (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French [...] "Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel" [...] (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special auxiliary tables with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.|$|E

We investigate the geometrical structures of circumscribed polytopes with a minimal number of facets and of inscribed polytopes with a minimal number of vertices. These objects, which constrain reflexive pairs of polyhedra {{from the interior}} and the exterior, {{can be described in}} terms of certain non-negative integral matrices. A major tool in the classification of these matrices is the existence of a pair of weight systems, indicating a relation to weighted projective spaces. This is the corner stone for an algorithm for the construction of all dual pairs of reflexive polyhedra that we expect to be efficient enough for an <b>enumerative</b> <b>classification</b> in up to 4 dimensions, which is the relevant case for Calabi-Yau compactifications in string theory.

50|$|Many library <b>classifications</b> {{combine the}} <b>enumerative</b> and faceted <b>classification</b> techniques. The Dewey Decimal Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, and the Universal Decimal Classification all {{make use of}} facets at various points in their {{enumerated}} classification schedules. The allowed facets vary based on the subject area of the classification. These facets are recorded as tables that represent recurring types of subdivisions within subject areas. There are general facets {{that can be used}} wherever appropriate, such as geographic subdivisions of the topic. Other tables are applied only to specific areas of the schedules. Facets can be combined to create a complex subject statement.|$|R
