40|$|International audienceThe {{improvement}} in mechanical and adhesion properties of polymer resins allowed to progressively substitute cast-in place rebars by chemically-bonded post-installed rebars in some applications, by providing equivalent or even higher mechanical properties at ambient temperature. However, the mechanical behavior of post-installed rebars is mainly {{governed by the}} mechanical behavior of polymer resins, which are highly sensitive to temperature, addressing the topic of fire safety. In 2015, the <b>European</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Document</b> 330087 - 00 - 06. 01 has been issued to harmonize the evaluation method on fire performance of these polymeric adhesives. This evaluation document proposes a fire design method allowing to ensure a sufficient bond resistance for a given duration of fire exposure before collapse. This paper presents a full-scale fire test performed in the " Vuclain " modular gas furnace at CSTB Champs-sur-Marne (France), carried out on a 2. 94 m x 2 m x 0. 15 m cantilever concrete slab connected to a wall by chemically-bonded post-installed rebars and exposed to ISO fire 834 - 1 until failure. Experimental investigations showed that the design method {{presented in this paper}} is able to predict a time of slab collapse very close to that obtained by the fire test. The interpretation of the data collected during the fire test revealed the presence of thermal and physical phenomena responsible for the decay in the fire resistance of the post-installed rebars and therefore, responsible for the slab collapse under fire exposure...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{legislation}} in Ireland permits farmers who are self-employed or who employ three or less employees to meet legal duties regarding {{safety and health}} management by complying with {{the terms of a}} Code of Practice and completing a Risk <b>Assessment</b> <b>Document.</b> A three year National Initiative commenced in 2005 to develop the Code of Practice and Risk <b>Assessment</b> <b>Documents</b> and to evaluate strategies to assist farmers to effectively complete and implement their legal requirements. Preliminary findings of an evaluation of the initial phase of the Initiative are presented in this paper. The evaluation was conducted among farmers who attended a half-day training course on completing and using the Risk <b>Assessment</b> <b>Document</b> are compared with a group of farmers who completed it without training. The study findings indicate that 74 % of farmers who returned the document for evaluation completed it satisfactorily. Satisfactory completeness rates were similar whether a training course was or was not attended. However, 100 % of participants stated that attendance at the training was worthwhile. The on-farm evaluation found that just over 24 % of the farms were not achieving a satisfactory standard of safety and health management and this was unrelated to the level of completeness of the document or attendance at a training course. Further research is required to determine what further assistance is required by farmers who either do not complete the Risk <b>Assessment</b> <b>Document</b> or achieve a satisfactory standard of safety and health management...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between scientific knowledge and uncertainty in science {{has been a}} central question in risk analysis. There have been several conceptualizations of uncertainty but most have been normative efforts to construct an ontology {{on the basis of}} theoretical considerations and there have been few empirical attempts to build such an ontology through textual analysis. Studies investigating how such ontologies work are equally scarce. We developed an ontology to investigate uncertainty in risk assessment in food safety comparing the EU and the US, and the two main domains of food safety: biohazards and contaminants. The ontology gauges expressions of uncertainty in two ways: one looks for stylistic clues of judgment, the other registers the content of the uncertainty expressed in the documents. We have built a large data base where English language risk <b>assessment</b> <b>documents</b> by the <b>European</b> Food Safety Agency and the three US agencies primarily responsible for food safety in the US are coded according to our ontology. We are also in the process of creating software that uses machine-learning algorithm to code risk <b>assessment</b> <b>documents</b> in our database. In our paper, we lay out our approach to scientific uncertainty, then describe the ontologies we developed to assess expressions of scientific uncertainty in risk <b>assessment</b> <b>documents</b> in food safety. We then discuss the results from supervised Machine Learning and the implications for both the method of machine coding and the insights we gained for human coding. Finally, we discuss some findings using the ontology testing three sets of hypotheses. The first one looks at differences in national styles in applied scientific research, the second differences in epistemic cultures between scientific subfields in food safety and the third about the effect of research and new knowledge on uncertainty...|$|R
