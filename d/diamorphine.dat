25|$|The 15-gram {{differentia}} {{meant the}} MDA might be harsher on a one-time offender trafficking in {{slightly more than}} 15grams of <b>diamorphine,</b> {{as opposed to a}} repeat offender who trafficked in slightly less than 15grams of <b>diamorphine</b> each time.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{disagreed}} with Yong's fifth argument that an offender {{who did not}} know the amount of pure <b>diamorphine</b> in the substance he was trafficking had not voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking. A drug trafficker would know his act was illegal and that he would be punished if caught, regardless of his knowledge of the precise amount of pure <b>diamorphine</b> he was trafficking. Yong's sixth argument was also dismissed, the Court explaining that the reason why the trafficking of a quantity of <b>diamorphine</b> greatly exceeding the 15-gram threshold did not incur a more severe sentence was because {{it would be impossible to}} impose a punishment more severe than the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|The 15-gram {{differentia}} {{failed to}} differentiate between an offender trafficking in slightly more than 15grams of <b>diamorphine</b> as opposed to one who trafficked in multiple times that quantity.|$|E
25|$|A heroin (<b>diamorphine)</b> {{or other}} opiate/opioid addict may use codeine {{to ward off}} the effects of {{withdrawal}} during periods of time where their preferred drug is unavailable or unaffordable.|$|E
25|$|A {{more refined}} method for {{creating}} Cheese heroin {{is done by}} taking #4 powder heroin and crushed diphenhydramine tablets, and adding them to water such that the active ingredients dissolve into the solution. The solution is then filtered via a micron filter to remove all the cuts and binders/fillers, leaving the user with a solution of high purity <b>diamorphine</b> HCl and diphenhydramine hcl. The water is then evaporated off, yielding a clumpy powder containing a highly purified mixture of heroin and DPH. It can also be further purified by titrating the solution with a weak to intermediate base such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to freebase the <b>diamorphine</b> and DPH.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if there}} was a {{quantitative}} and incremental increase in guilt or mischief associated with trafficking in just over 15grams of <b>diamorphine</b> as opposed to just under 15grams, it would be inappropriate to respond to this with a qualitative and non-incremental increase in the prescribed penalty.|$|E
25|$|The police then {{investigated}} other deaths Shipman had certified, {{and created}} a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of <b>diamorphine,</b> signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate {{that they had been}} in poor health.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{sentencing}} {{under the}} MDA being based on general deterrence, {{the court was}} disallowed from considering if the offender had voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking in controlled drugs. It was unlikely that an offender would know if the substance he was trafficking contained the amount of <b>diamorphine</b> sufficient to fulfil the 15-gram differentia.|$|E
25|$|It is more lipid-soluble than morphine, {{resulting}} in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120–150 minutes, although it is typically administered at 4– to 6-hour intervals. Pethidine {{has been shown to}} be less effective than morphine, <b>diamorphine,</b> or hydromorphone at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to {{drowsiness}} usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, {{switching to}} an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as fentanyl, morphine and <b>diamorphine</b> (heroin) {{tend to be}} particularly sedating, while others such as oxycodone, tilidine and meperidine (pethidine) tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree {{of trial and error}} may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Otherwise, treatment with CNS stimulants is generally effective.|$|E
25|$|Diacetylmorphine (better {{known as}} heroin) was {{synthesized}} from morphine in 1874 {{and brought to}} market by Bayer in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight. Due to the lipid solubility of diacetylmorphine, it can cross the blood–brain barrier faster than morphine, subsequently increasing the reinforcing component of addiction. Using a variety of subjective and objective measures, one study estimated the relative potency of heroin to morphine administered intravenously to post-addicts to be 1.80–2.66mg of morphine sulfate to 1mg of <b>diamorphine</b> hydrochloride (heroin).|$|E
25|$|Patients {{arriving}} {{to the emergency}} department with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) {{are likely to be}} triaged to the resuscitation area. They will receive oxygen and monitoring and have an early ECG; aspirin will be given if not contraindicated or not already administered by the ambulance team; morphine or <b>diamorphine</b> will be given for pain; sub lingual (under the tongue) or buccal (between cheek and upper gum) glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) (GTN or NTG) will be given, unless contraindicated by the presence of other drugs, such as drugs that treat erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, {{and she went to}} the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of <b>diamorphine,</b> often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} of non-opiate substances relative to the <b>diamorphine</b> content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel must address the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either {{the completion of the}} toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The acetaminophen content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of acetaminophen are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not know how much acetaminophen is in any given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{a highly}} {{addictive}} substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness. Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine/meperidine, former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also {{much more likely to}} produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids. The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, <b>diamorphine,</b> or diacetyl morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine prodrug, essentially meaning they are identical drugs in vivo. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.|$|E
500|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), the Court of Appeal had to {{determine}} the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes. In that case, the differentiating factor {{was found in the}} Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA"), which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than [...] of <b>diamorphine</b> (heroin) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction. Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005), which had applied Ong Ah Chuan, the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA. The Court also noted that the [...] "quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender's crime." [...] Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case, the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong.|$|E
2500|$|Yong {{argued that}} the MDA made the {{quantity}} of 15grams of <b>diamorphine</b> the only determinant of whether the mandatory death penalty should be imposed, {{and that this was}} highly arbitrary as baseless distinctions had to be drawn between offenders who trafficked in different amounts of controlled drugs. Six points were raised to support this contention: ...|$|E
2500|$|Carefully {{titrating}} {{the dose}} of opioids can provide for effective pain relief while minimizing adverse effects. Morphine and <b>diamorphine</b> {{have been shown}} to have a wider therapeutic range or [...] "safety margin" [...] than some other opioids. Because the effective quantity varies and cannot be predicted, dose titration usually starts at low amounts, increasing until the desired or adverse effect occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Shipman's {{trial began}} at Preston Crown Court on 5 October 1999. Shipman {{was charged with}} the murders of Marie West, Irene Turner, Lizzie Adams, Jean Lilley, Ivy Lomas, Muriel Grimshaw, Marie Quinn, Kathleen Wagstaff, Bianka Pomfret, Norah Nuttall, Pamela Hillier, Maureen Ward, Winifred Mellor, Joan Melia and Kathleen Grundy by lethal {{injections}} of <b>diamorphine,</b> all between 1995 and 1998. [...] His legal representatives tried, but failed, to have the Grundy case, where a clear motive was alleged, tried separately from the others, where no motive was apparent.|$|E
2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that the {{mandatory}} death penalty does not violate Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which states: [...] "All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the {{equal protection of the}} law." [...] In its opinion, the [...] differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed for trafficking in <b>diamorphine</b> (heroin) cannot be said to be purely arbitrary, and bears a rational relation to the social object of the Act which is to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade.|$|E
2500|$|The appellant, Yong Vui Kong, was a 19-year-old Malaysian {{national}} who {{was arrested}} in Singapore on 13 June 2007 and charged with trafficking in [...] of <b>diamorphine</b> (heroin), a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA"). Yong told investigators {{that he had not}} been aware of the contents of the packages which he was asked to handle, maintaining instead that he had been delivering packages for his boss, a man known as [...] "Ah Hiang", for whom he was working as a debt-collector. Ah Hiang had instructed him not to open the packages, and Yong had acted according to these instructions even though he was suspicious of the contents.|$|E
2500|$|This {{releases}} the bound hydrochloride salts {{on both the}} <b>diamorphine</b> and DPH, such that the HCl ions dissolve into the water while the heroin and diphenhydramine are freebased; this allows the molecules to precipitate out as the solution is titrated. The precipitates (heroin and DPH) are then collected, leaving behind all of the process waste. Lastly (and optionally) the super high purity (90%-99%) heroin-DPH mixture is added to a water solution and hydrochloric, acetic, or citric acid is carefully titrated to yield up to 99.9% pure [...] "cheese" [...] heroin in the salt form, which is again run through a micron filter and extracted to a powder via evaporation (water-soluble, and as such is the type used for injection and insuffalation ROA's) otherwise this step is excluded and the Cheese is in a super pure base form (which can be efficiently smoked).|$|E
2500|$|Narcotics laws {{established}} by the Misuse of Drugs Act are very strict. Anyone caught with more than [...] of heroin (<b>diamorphine),</b> [...] of cocaine or morphine, [...] of methamphetamine, or [...] of cannabis faces mandatory capital punishment, as they are deemed to be trafficking in these substances. The stated quantities are the net weight of the substances {{after they have been}} isolated by laboratory analysis. Between 1991 and 2004, 400 people were hanged in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, one of the highest per-capita execution rates in the world. Persons caught with amounts of controlled substances less than the quantities that would warrant the mandatory death sentence may be spared from the gallows. They may, however, still face harsh penalties ranging from long terms of imprisonment to a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane (for males).|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{trial in}} the High Court, Yong {{was found guilty of}} drug {{trafficking}} contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the MDA. Trafficking in more than [...] of <b>diamorphine</b> attracts a mandatory death penalty. The Court was of the view that Yong must have known that he had been carrying drugs. Yong instructed his counsel to file an appeal, but later asked that the appeal be withdrawn. His case was eventually taken over by another lawyer, M. Ravi, who had been instructed by Yong's brother. In the meantime, Yong had also petitioned the President of Singapore for clemency. This was rejected on 20 November 2009 and Yong's execution was set for 4 December 2009. Ravi then filed an urgent motion to challenge the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty prescribed by the MDA. The motion was heard by Justice Woo Bih Li, who granted a stay of execution pending a decision by the Court of Appeal of Singapore.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, <b>diamorphine</b> is {{regulated}} under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It is available by prescription. Anyone supplying <b>diamorphine</b> without a valid prescription can be fined $10,000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing <b>diamorphine</b> is a $50,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of <b>diamorphine</b> {{without a license}} from the Department of Health is illegal with a $10,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>diamorphine</b> is a Schedule I drug {{according}} to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, making it illegal to possess without a DEA license. Possession of more than 100 grams of <b>diamorphine</b> or a mixture containing <b>diamorphine</b> is punishable with a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years of imprisonment in a federal prison.|$|E
5000|$|The UK Department of Health's Rolleston Committee Report in 1926 {{established}} the British approach to <b>diamorphine</b> prescription to users, which was maintained {{for the next}} 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe <b>diamorphine</b> to users when withdrawing from it would cause harm or severe distress to the patient. This [...] "policing and prescribing" [...] policy effectively controlled the perceived <b>diamorphine</b> problem in the UK until 1959 {{when the number of}} <b>diamorphine</b> addicts doubled every 16 months during the ten years from 1959 to 1968. In 1964 the Brain Committee recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialised centres be allowed to prescribe <b>diamorphine</b> and benzoylmethylecgonine (cocaine) to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently {{only a small number of}} users in the UK are prescribed <b>diamorphine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 2009 the German Bundestag {{passed a}} law {{allowing}} <b>diamorphine</b> prescription as a standard treatment for addicts; a large-scale trial of <b>diamorphine</b> prescription had been authorized in that country in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, <b>diamorphine</b> is a {{controlled}} substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Any person seeking or obtaining <b>diamorphine</b> without disclosing authorization 30 days before obtaining another prescription from a practitioner {{is guilty of}} an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Possession of <b>diamorphine</b> {{for the purpose of}} trafficking is an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for life.|$|E
50|$|The 15-gram {{differentia}} {{meant the}} MDA might be harsher on a one-time offender trafficking in {{slightly more than}} 15 grams of <b>diamorphine,</b> {{as opposed to a}} repeat offender who trafficked in slightly less than 15 grams of <b>diamorphine</b> each time.|$|E
50|$|The trials proved <b>diamorphine</b> {{maintenance}} to {{be superior}} {{to other forms of}} treatment in improving the social and health situation for this group of patients. It has also been shown to save money, despite high treatment expenses, as it significantly reduces costs incurred by trials, incarceration, health interventions and delinquency. Patients appear twice daily at a treatment center, where they inject their dose of <b>diamorphine</b> under the supervision of medical staff. They are required to contribute about 450 Swiss francs per month to the treatment costs. A national referendum in November 2008 showed 68% of voters supported the plan, introducing <b>diamorphine</b> prescription into federal law. The previous trials were based on time-limited executive ordinances. The success of the Swiss trials led German, Dutch, and Canadian cities to try out their own <b>diamorphine</b> prescription programs. Some Australian cities (such as Sydney) have instituted legal <b>diamorphine</b> supervised injecting centers, in line with other wider harm minimization programs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamorphine</b> is 1.50-1.80 {{times the}} potency of morphine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamorphine</b> {{continues}} to be widely used in palliative care in the UK, where it is commonly given by the subcutaneous route, often via a syringe driver, if patients cannot easily swallow morphine solution. The advantage of <b>diamorphine</b> over morphine is that <b>diamorphine</b> is more fat soluble and therefore more potent by injection, so smaller doses of it are needed for {{the same effect on}} pain. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary in palliative care.|$|E

50|$|It {{was agreed}} to send Liddell to a hospice. Moor set the <b>diamorphine</b> level {{at a rate}} of 30 mg per 24-hours by means of a syringe driver. Liddell's {{breathing}} got worse and on 19 July 1997 Moor gave him an injection of <b>diamorphine</b> and chlorpromazine. Within about 20 minutes Liddell was dead.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>diamorphine</b> is {{available}} by prescription, {{though it is}} a restricted Class A drug. According to the 50th edition of the British National Formulary (BNF), <b>diamorphine</b> hydrochloride may be used in the treatment of acute pain, myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary oedema, and chronic pain. The treatment of chronic non-malignant pain must be supervised by a specialist. The BNF notes that all opioid analgesics cause dependence and tolerance but that this is [...] "no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness". When used in the palliative care of cancer patients, <b>diamorphine</b> is often injected using a syringe driver.|$|E
