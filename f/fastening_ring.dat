The procession in no way accorded with Godfrey's preconceived idea. The men were walking along without much attempt at regular order.

5000|$|The dhal {{is a type}} of buckler {{originating}} in South Asia, The Persian form being the sipar. They are nearly always round and vary in diameter from about eight inches to twenty four inches. Some are nearly flat while others are strongly convex or curved. [...] The edges may be flat or rolled back in the reverse direction to that of the curvature of the shield. They were made from animal hide or occasionally steel. The steel shields are usually inlaid with silver and gold, though on some occasions they are covered with inscriptions. The dhal is held by two handles <b>fastened</b> to <b>ring</b> bolts that pass through the shield and are riveted to bosses on the outside. Between the handles is a square cushion for the knuckles to rest against. The handles are so placed that, when tightly grasped, they force the backs of the fingers against the cushion giving a very firm and comfortable hold. Some Persian shields have three handles, two placed at the center as usual, and the third near the edge. The arm can be passed through the third loop and the center handles held in the hand; or it can be held by the center handles only.|$|R

In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.|$|R

One of these parcels, <b>fastened</b> with elastic <b>rings,</b> must be magnum bonum, and Janet, though without much chance of distinguishing it, was reading the labels with a strange, sad fascination, when, long before she had expected him, her uncle stood before her, with greatly astonished and displeased looks, and the word [...] "Janet." ...|$|R

He was carried within reach of the cordage where the warrior still clung, though with rapidly diminishing strength. Catching one leg on a loop of the tangled strands Gahan pulled himself close enough to seize another quite near to the fellow. Clinging precariously to this new hold the jed slowly drew in the landing leather, down which he had clambered until he could grasp the hook at its end. This he <b>fastened</b> to a <b>ring</b> in the warrior's harness, just before the man's weakened fingers slipped from their hold upon the cordage.|$|R

I soon cleared away the earth, and pulling up the door, found a staircase, which I hastily made up my mind to go down, carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection. When I reached the bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace, as brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that I had ever seen, with a long gallery supported by pillars of jasper, ornamented with capitals of gold. Down this gallery a lady came to meet me, of such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought only of her.|$|R

The flame for an instant lit up the ring, the man's dark face, mustache, and white teeth set together as he tugged at the girth, and Lanty's brown, velvet eyes and soft, round cheek framed in the basket.

Historical documents refer to the inserts as mianling, literally translating to Burmese bells. In the Philippines, researchers have established that these were present in various forms from the Visayas to southern Luzon. In the Visayas, pins made of gold, ivory, or brass were inserted in young boys through their penis heads, according to research by the pre-eminent historian of pre-colonial Philippines, William Henry Scott. As the boys grew older, these pins would be decorated and they would later <b>fasten</b> bluntly spiked <b>rings</b> for the stimulation of their sex partners. In Barangay, his study of 16th century Philippine ethnography, Scott wrote, [...] "these ornaments required manipulation by the woman herself to insert and could not be withdrawn until the male organ was completely relaxed."

40|$|In a {{classical}} educational approach the DC commutator generator {{is presented in}} the schematic form, as given in Fig. 1, and run of its electromotive force- in Fig. 2. The DC commutator generator is consisted of: − the motionless stator which can be schematically presented in the form of pair of permanent magnets (Fig. 1, where: „N” – north pole, „S ” – south pole), producing constant magnetic field of B intensity and the sense from „N ” to „S” − the rotor rotated with ω 2 velocity by an external mechanical force. On the rotor winding turns are winded in which the electromotive force e, (EMF), is induced. The force can be described as follows: e = ⏐k · B · sin(ω 2 t) ⏐ (1) where: k – design coefficient of a given generator B – magnetic field intensity ω 2 – instantaneous angular velocity of generator rotor − the commutator, i. e. the <b>ring</b> <b>fastened</b> on the rotor and made of a conductive material.

On both the STS- 1 and STS- 2 flights this gap was discovered to vary anywhere from an intended gap of 0. 375 in. to an actual measured gap of 0. 60 in. due to tolerances. Tests were conducted with and without a 0. 25 in. thick cork shim placed under the seal with a 0. 60 in. gap under the phenolic TPS to determine and compare {{the performance of the}} seal in the two different configurations. To alleviate the difficult and costly procedure of installing the cork shim under the seal, especially after phenolic TPS mounting on the attach ring, large fishtail seals of idential Elder gray silicon material and two different hardnesses were tested. A similar matrix of tests was conducted with this new large fishtail seal, and seals with both type hardnesses performed well {{regardless of whether or not}} the seal was bonded in the phenolic at the front of the seal groove.

The [...] "Edamthala" [...] is made of only one/two layer of cow skin and the [...] "Valamthala" [...] will have a five/seven layer skin, so as to have a bass sound. The skin are dried under shadow and <b>fastened</b> on wooden <b>rings</b> (Chenda Vattam, ചെണ്ട വട്ടം) made of the trunk of a locally available palm tree (Eeranpana) or bamboo, using a gum prepared from the seed of a tree called [...] "pananchi maram". The circular frame is kept in a vessel, boiled for an entire day and then bent in the form of circle and dried up. The body of the Chenda which is 1 ft in diameter and 1.5 inches thickness is made of the soft wood of the jackfruit tree (വരിക്ക പ്ലാവ്) (Varikka Plavu). The thickness is again reduced by 0.25 inches, at simultaneous points separated by 4 inches. This is done in order to produce highly resonating sound. Only the wooden rings with the skin (Chenda Vattam) is replaced once the quality of the sound is not up to the mark. For regular Chenda artists an average of 15 rings are required every year.|$|R
