5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a <b>historical</b> <b>geography</b> of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E

Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers © Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) ] and the definitive version is available at: www. blackwell-synergy. comThis paper examines informal citizenship training for youth and the <b>historical</b> <b>geographies</b> of education over time through analysing the Scout Movement in Britain and its activities {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. In doing so, it highlights the complexity of youth citizenship and the significance of non-school spaces in civil society to our understandings of young people's positioning as citizen-subjects. Drawing on archival research, I demonstrate how a specific youth citizenship project was constructed and maintained through the Scout Movement. I argue that various processes, strategies and regulations were involved in envisioning 'citizen-scout' and developing both duty-bound, self-regulated individuals as well as a wider collective body of British youth. This analysis speaks to broader debates on citizenship, nationhood and youth, as well as highlighting how the <b>historical</b> <b>geographies</b> of citizenship education are an important area of study for geographers...|$|R

25|$|Manuilă had a sinuous career {{during the}} first years of World War II, when his {{interest}} shifted toward geopolitics and <b>historical</b> <b>geography.</b> In 1938, upon Gusti's recommendation, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy; until 1940, he was also a department head within Banu's Institute of Hygiene and Public Health. In 1939, Carol II's National Renaissance Front (FRN) terminated Manuilă's ICS, and all statisticians were left unemployed. During 1940, the regime again appealed to Manuilă's expertise. At the time, Romania had abandoned its friendship with the Western Allies, and was testing a rapprochement with Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers. This, however, meant negotiating territorial exchanges with the Nazi-backed Kingdom of Hungary. With Mihail Manoilescu and other Foreign Affairs officials, Manuilă attended the meeting in Turnu Severin, where the Romanian side first took into consideration population exchanges between Romania and Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other mosaics {{found in}} the region, the Reḥob mosaic has {{very little in the}} form of ornate design and {{symmetric}} patterns, but is unique due to its inscription, acclaimed by scholars {{to be one of the}} most important epigraphical findings discovered in Israel in the last century. Its text sheds invaluable light on the <b>historical</b> <b>geography</b> (toponymy) of Palestine during the Roman and late-Byzantine periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in the region of Beit Shean (Scythopolis) and the Jordan valley, Sussitha (Hippos) and its neighboring cities on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, Naveh (Nawā) in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, Tyre and its neighboring cities to the south, as well as towns in the vicinity of Sebaste and Caesarea, and Ashqelon to the south. By delineating the boundaries of the Land of Israel, it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian captivity, and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in what concerns the laws of Seventh Year produce, and of demai-produce. The mosaic also describes different kinds of fruits and vegetables that were cultivated in the country at the time.|$|E

Drawing from critical legal approaches I offer a preliminary geographical and historical theorization of lawfare so that we may better understand the relationship between war and law today...|$|R

500|$|In Romanian historiography, Glad is {{presented}} {{as one of the}} three local [...] "voivodes" [...] who ruled territories inhabited by Romanians {{at the time of the}} Hungarian Conquest. Madgearu and Pop list almost a dozen place-names from the Banat and its wider region which suggest that settlements were named after Glad. For instance, a village named Cladova (formerly Galadua) and a monastery named Galad were first mentioned in 1308 and 1333, respectively, and an Ottoman document from 1579 referred to two villages named Gladeš and a settlement named Kladova. Silviu Oța writes that the theory of a connection between Glad and the name of those settlements is [...] "considerably weak", because neither the origins nor the chronology of those place names have so far been thoroughly studied. Oţa also says, [...] "the <b>historical</b> <b>geography</b> of the Banat is reflected quite accurately in the chronicle", which suggests that Anonymus knew the geographical features of the region, but does not prove that Glad was a real person. According to Györffy and other historians, Anonymus who invented all local rulers in the Gesta named Glad after the village where the monastery was built. Deletant, Macartney and other scholars also say that Anonymus seems to have borrowed many episodes of his narrative of Glad (including his connection with Vidin) from the story of his alleged descendant, Ahtum, in the Long Life of Saint Gerard.|$|E

Whilst {{there has been some}} discussion of Utility within the context of modernism in design, the paper explores the broader <b>historical</b> <b>geographies</b> of Utility furniture. We demonstrate the ways in which state activity in wartime reconfigured socio-economic networks of production, distribution and consumption.

40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the historical}} and socio-political contexts of the design and delivery of school-based sexuality education for young {{women and men in}} two sub-Saharan African countries: Ghana and Mozambique. The chapter interrogates colonising tendencies within, and created through, school-based sexuality education. Emphasis is placed on the forms of knowledge and pedagogies that are promoted by Western donors in the design and delivery of school-based sexuality. The analyses of the bodies of knowledge and pedagogies underpinning sexuality education in Ghana and Mozambique draws on African feminist, postcolonial, and anti-colonial theories. In addition, the chapter builds on scholarly work on the geographies of childhoods and youth that theorises young people as hybrid products of the complex <b>historical</b> <b>geographies</b> of former colonised nations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{interprets the}} {{strategies}} {{that have been}} associated with the war on terror against the backdrop of <b>historical</b> <b>geographies</b> of colonial violence and dispossession. It joins those who argue that wider anxieties about the sources of danger, criminality, violence and terror have become intertwined. These reveal as much about sensibilities of race, class and 'security' as they do objective dangers. Thus the article considers how, drawing on the British case, detentions and deportations marked by race are connected with and form part of an overlapping regime of 'security', 'immigration' and asylum. This is exemplified via an account of the trajectory British sovereign territory of Diego Garcia, leading to wider reflections on contemporary forms of sovereignty and the operation of 'race' in geopolitics...|$|R
