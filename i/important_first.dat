5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most <b>important</b> <b>first,</b> with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the {{audience}} claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an <b>important</b> <b>first</b> step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{more active}} {{in the early morning}} than at other times of the day; flying more when visiting flowers at the time when nectar is most abundant. Its body mass {{decreases}} during the night, and then increases during the day with the greatest increase occurring during the <b>important</b> <b>first</b> hour of early morning foraging. It seems to make up around half of the overnight water loss during this hour. The energy that the brown honeyeater can potentially get from nectar exceeds its requirements in all seasons except winter, when it needs to be selective in the plants that are used, to balance energy intake and expenditure. It compensates for any lessening in nectar concentration by increasing the frequency of feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an <b>important</b> <b>first</b> step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

25|$|His {{international}} {{reputation and}} his signature photographic passions were established by four key books {{published in the}} 1960s. Five Girls (1962) explored a fresh approach to photographing the nude female figure and contained <b>important</b> <b>first</b> explorations with black-and-white printing, cropping and book design, which were a key feature of his subsequent books. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories (1964) was probably the first book to deliberately explore black-and-white photographic grain as a medium for expression and image design. It was highly influential at the time, sold roughly a million copies worldwide and won the Prix Nadar in France in 1964. It continues to influence contemporary photographers, film makers, fashion designers and make-up artists. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories or 'Kate' as the book is often referred to, had its place in photographic history cemented in 2005 when the International Center of Photography in New York included the book in their exhibition The Open Book: A History of the Photographic Book from 1878 to the Present.|$|E
