6000|$|So {{much for}} one European fashion. Every country {{has its own}} ways. It may {{interest}} the reader {{to know how they}} [...] "put horses to" [...] on the continent. The man stands up the horses {{on each side of the}} thing that projects from the front end of the wagon, and then throws the tangled mess of <b>gear</b> <b>forward</b> through a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse, opposite to the first one, after crossing them and bringing the loose end back, and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse, and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke of before, and puts another thing over each horse's head, with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, and brings the ends of these things aft over his back, after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up, and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned a while ago, and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon, and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with. I never have buckled up a horse myself, but I do not think we do it that way.|$|E
6000|$|The Molly Swash {{was still}} under her canvas, though very little sufficed for her present purposes. She was {{directly}} off Whitestone, and was making easy stretches across the passage, or river, as it is called, having nothing set but her huge fore-and-aft mainsail and the jib. Under this sail she worked like a top, and Spike sometimes fancied she travelled too fast for his purposes, the night air having thickened the canvas as usual, until it [...] "held the wind as a bottle holds water." [...] There was nothing in this, however, to attract the particular attention of the ship-master's widow, a sail, more or less, being connected with observation much too critical for her schooling, nice as the last had been. She {{was surprised to find}} the men stripping the brig forward, and converting her into a schooner. Nor was this done in a loose and slovenly manner, under favour of the obscurity. On the contrary, it was so well executed that it might have deceived even a seaman under a noon-day sun, provided the vessel were a mile or two distant. The manner in which the metamorphosis was made was as follows: the studding-sail booms had been taken off the topsail-yard, in order to shorten it to the eye, and the yard itself was swayed up about half-mast, to give it the appearance of a schooner's fore-yard. The brig's real lower yard was lowered on the bulwarks, while her royal yard was sent down altogether, and the topgallant-mast was lowered until the heel rested on the topsail yard, all of which, in the night, gave the <b>gear</b> <b>forward</b> very much the appearance of that of a fore-topsail schooner, instead of that of a half-rigged brig, as the craft really was. As the vessel carried a try-sail on her foremast, it answered very well, in the dark, to represent a schooner's foresail. Several other little dispositions of this nature were made, about which it might weary the uninitiated to read, but which will readily suggest themselves to the mind of a sailor.|$|E

50|$|The {{next project}} {{was a car}} with a bit heavier engine. In 1902 a 9 hp and a 12 hp-version were offered, which had a quite modern cardan axle with three <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> and one backwards.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to various civil roles, the EC120 {{has also been}} used by several military operators to conduct training, observation and light utility missions. Airbus Helicopter has promoted the type in a training capacity due to features such as positive control response, performance computation systems, modern instrumentation for ease of use, overall compact size, and {{a high level of}} cabin visibility. A wide range of optional equipment can be installed upon the EC120 B, this includes a wire strike protection system, air conditioning, sand filter, skis, windshield wipers, electrical external mirrors, a cargo sling, emergency flotation <b>gear,</b> <b>forward</b> looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, and external spotlights. For corporate customers, the EC120 can be equipped with a Stylence interior, offering a luxurious interior with leather upholstery, in-flight office and telecommunications facilities, along with reduced noise and vibration levels via additional insulation.|$|E
50|$|It {{was able}} to reach up to 30 km/h. It seated four, the two rear seats could be covered by a {{convertible}} top. The car was steered by handlebars. Tilting of the handlebars forward and backward served to change <b>gears</b> (<b>forward</b> - lower <b>gear).</b> The wheels were wooden with gum tyre.|$|R
50|$|The Bij 't Vuur was a Dutch {{automobile}} manufactured from 1902 until 1906. The first {{cars had}} Aster engines but later ones used De Dion-Bouton or Panhard units. In 1902 a 9 h.p. and a 12 h.p. -version were offered, {{which had a}} quite modern cardan axle with three <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> and one backwards.|$|R
50|$|The Simpson gearset is {{now more}} or less obsolete. Other gearsets can make 4 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> with just two planetaries. Most modern {{gearboxes}} employ the Ravigneaux planetary gearset design, which produces 4 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> from a single set, or a Lepelletier gearset which provides 6 or more <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> by adding another standard planetary to the Ravigneaux gearset.|$|R
50|$|The {{gear box}} is mounted under the frame {{in front of}} the rear axle. The gears are changed through two gear sticks {{in front of the}} driver. The truck has 3 <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> and reverse. It was able to reach 20 km/h. The fuel {{consumption}} was 4 kg of petrol per 100 km and it was able to climb 12° angle.|$|R

50|$|The SKYACTIV-Drive is {{a family}} of {{automatic}} transmissions, named SKY-Drive.Mazda rejected dual-clutch technology in automatic transmissions, because the dual-clutch behavior in certain situations was sub-optimal. Instead, Mazda chose to re-design the conventional automatic transmission, making the torque converter take less duty while a multi-plate clutch disengages the torque converter most of the time. The new SkyActiv automatic transmission was designed to have six <b>gears</b> <b>forward,</b> one reverse <b>gear,</b> a short torque converter and a clutch integrated with the torque converter.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{transmission}} upshifted to second <b>gear,</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> assembly locked and the input torus now ran at engine speed. This had the desirable effect of [...] "tightening" [...] the coupling and reducing slippage, but unfortunately also produced a somewhat abrupt shift. It wasn't at all uncommon for {{the vehicle to}} lurch forward during the 1-2 shift, especially when the throttle was wide open.|$|R
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} was tricycle, {{and equipped}} with the latest multi-disc, anti-skid brakes. The steerable nose wheel retracted to the rear, while the main <b>gear</b> retracted <b>forward.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 6TD-2 engine {{drives a}} French-designed hydro-mechanical {{automatic}} transmission, the SESM ESM500, {{which is also}} fitted to the Leclerc MBT. Capable of manual and fully automatic power-shifting, the transmission has 5 forward and 2 reverse speeds along with a braking system that incorporates carbon friction brakes and a secondary speed-retarding system. Gear changes are controlled by a torque converter which is made more efficient by addition of an automatic lock-up clutch. There is also a mechanical back-up system for use in emergencies, able to shift 2 <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> and reverse.|$|R

50|$|The {{shift from}} third to fourth <b>gear</b> locked the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> assembly, {{producing}} 1.00:1 transmission. The fluid coupling now only handled about 25 {{percent of the}} engine torque, reducing slippage to a negligible amount. The result was a remarkably efficient level of power transfer at highway speeds, something that torque converter equipped automatics could not achieve {{without the benefit of}} a converter clutch.|$|R
50|$|Originally an {{engineering}} club, <b>Gear</b> it <b>Forward</b> {{was started in}} 2007. The club has since grown to attract students from both Oswego High School and Oswego East High School to design and create robots through the FIRST Robotics organization.|$|R
50|$|A {{reverse gear}} {{implemented}} this way makes a loud whining sound, {{which is not}} normally heard in the <b>forward</b> <b>gears.</b> The teeth on the <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When helical gears rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> being always meshed, they do not make a sound {{that can be easily}} heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are spur gears, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.|$|R
50|$|The {{weight of}} the 2S25 is 18 tonnes which is {{comparable}} to that of infantry fighting vehicles. Like the BMD-3, the 2S25 features hydropneumatic suspension with a variable height clearance of 190-590 mm within 6-7 seconds to reduce visibility. Hydropneumatic suspension provides high smoothness while driving and dampens recoil of the main gun. Suspension on each side consists of seven single rollers, four support rollers, rear wheel drive and a front-mounted steering wheel. There are hydraulic track adjusters in assistance for greater mobility. In the engine-transmission compartment, multi-fuel diesel engine 2V-06-2S installed, which develops a power of 510 hp (380 kW). It features an automatic transmission that has five <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> and five <b>gears</b> reverse.|$|R

25|$|The 4RM {{system used}} in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in {{that it has a}} rear {{transaxle}} with secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three <b>gears,</b> two <b>forward,</b> and reverse. The two <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> of the front transmission match the lower four <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.|$|R
50|$|The Simpson {{planetary}} gearset {{consists of two}} {{planetary gearset}}s, both having the same gears and gear ratios. It was employed in automatic transmissions. It {{was one of the}} several designs invented by American engineer Howard Simpson. A Simpson gearset delivers three <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> and one reverse, plus neutral. Actually there are four <b>forward</b> <b>gears,</b> but two of them have exactly the same ratio, so there are three distinct gears. Third gear is always direct drive (1:1).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The thesis {{built the}} {{simulation}} model of automobile variable transmission driving efficiency, and calculated the transmission efficiency {{by using the}} MASTA software under different conditions. The simulation {{results showed that the}} reverse transmission efficiency is the lowest. With <b>gears</b> <b>forward</b> 1 ~ 4, its transmission efficiency increased gradually, while the fifth gear is overdrive, therefore its transmission efficiency is lower than the fourth direct file. The transmission efficiency of the same gear increases and then decreases with the increase of the torque input. While the range of the transmission efficiency between different speed increases along with the increase of the torque. With the increase of the rotational speed of the gearbox, the transmission efficiency increase gradually, but the increase amplitude reduces gradually. The great method provides some reference {{for the study of the}} transmission efficiency...|$|R
