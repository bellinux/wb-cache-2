5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E

5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> to note that some detainees who were {{subjected}} to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E

5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in Islam to have clear {{differences}} (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage {{women to have}} long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although {{this would be a}} direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
5|$|The River Kennet {{was made}} navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath in 1727. The Kennet and Avon Canal between Newbury and Bath was built between 1794 and 1810 by John Rennie, to convey {{commercial}} barges carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes. and is 57miles (92km) long. The two river navigations and the canal total 87miles (140km) in length. The section from Bristol to Bath is {{the course of the}} River Avon, which flows through a wide valley and has been made navigable by a series of locks and weirs. In the later 19th century and early 20th century the canal fell into disuse following competition from the Great Western Railway, who owned the canal. Between 1970 and 1990 the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, and today is a popular heritage tourism destination, for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for wildlife conservation.|$|E
