He also developed a system of measuring <b>grass</b> <b>output</b> which he called the Cow Day System.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{discrepancy}} between the estimated feeding value of fresh <b>grass</b> and the <b>output</b> per kg <b>grass</b> in terms of milk and maintenance was studied by evaluating 12 experiments with grass-fed dairy cows. The percentage grass in the diets varied between 40 and 90. Intake and milk production were recorded daily. Per treatment a number of parameters relating to {{the composition of the}} grass, characteristics of the animals, and composition of the total diet were determined. The correlation between each of these parameters and the measured discrepancy was calculated. The digestible organic matter in the grass (DOM), intake of grass, intestinal digestible protein in the total diet, percentage milk protein and body weight gain correlated well with the discrepancy. It was concluded that energy input from <b>grass</b> and energy <b>output</b> in milk production were significantly different (P< 0. 05). For the diets with 80 – 90 % grass a high DOM increased discrepancy. It was furthermore concluded that the maintenance requirements of lactating dairy cows fed grass-based diets are probably higher than the currently used values This was ascribed to energy requirements in the gastro-intestinal tract and to nitrogen excretion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{simulations}} {{supplied by}} a combination of a global climate model and a weather generator allowed the creation of two climate scenarios including an increase and/or monthly variations in temperature for the 2070 - 2100 horizon, which were compared with two currently available series (1961 - 1990 and 1990 - 2000). Three forage systems applied in upland areas of southern France were simulated using the STICS model (silage maize, perennial alfalfa and <b>grasses)</b> and the <b>outputs</b> were introduced into a digital elevation model. We noted changes in precocity which allowed the sowing of silage maize varieties with longer crop cycles at lower altitudes and an enlargement of the crop zone above 700 - 800 m. When introducing monthly temperature variations, we observed major frost damage which decreased maize yields. As for gramineous and alfalfa grasslands, we obtained a lengthening in the growing period with earlier first cut dates and sometimes the possibility of a supplementary cut...|$|R
50|$|Although {{not built}} as a Dow-owned {{facility}} on Dow property, the 300MW Salt Grass Combined Cycle, using 4xW501 units (1xW501A, 3xW501AA), was {{built as a}} dedicated power supply for Dow’s Freeport, TX, expanding operations. The plant was designed, built and owned by Power Systems Engineering (PSE) in 1970-1972. (PSE was later incorporated into DESTEC Energy after being acquired by Dow in 1989. DESTEC later morphed into Dynegy a major independent power generating company.)Unlike most industrial generating plants, {{there was to be}} no process steam requirement for the Salt <b>Grass</b> plant; all <b>output</b> from the plant was to be in the form of electric energy. The design objective was to use the largest gas turbines available and, based on prior experience, to use unfired heat recovery boilers for operating simplicity and improved reliability. All steam was used to drive 4 identical 25MW steam turbines coupled to the gas turbines at the outboard end of the generators (which in turn were mounted on the cold compressor-end of the rotor). The plant comprised four separate single-shaft combined cycle units for maximum operating flexibility. It also included a start-up boiler to enable the steam turbines to be used to start the gas turbines.|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} Grass has changed drastically {{over the last}} decade. Up to the mid-sixties, judgments like 'immoral' and 'obscene' were the norm in assessments of Grass's work. Reviews after 1965, however, emphasised the ethical content of <b>Grass's</b> literary <b>output.</b> This volte-face retrospectively also changed attitudes to Die Blechtrommel and Hunde-jahre. The impulse to reinterpret Grass in this new light came from the writer's extra-literary activities. This study attempts to demonstrate that Grass's political commitment {{is rooted in the}} work itself. It explores by textual analysis how this ethical awareness is condensed in Grass's imagery. A close investigation of the choice and use of imagery reveals that commitment in his works is by no means static. The theoretical framework of the study is Sartre's definition of littirature engagle, as far as it is applicable to the work of Grass. The first chapter concludes {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between 'implicit' and 'explicit' commitment, between Engagement and Tendenz. The second chapter examines the relationship between politics and literature in Grass's extra-literary work, that is his political essays on the one hand and his essays on literature on the other,contrasting Grass's practice of commitment with Sartre's theory. Chapter three focuses on the role of the drum in Die Blechtrommel, establishing its moral premises with particular reference to its relationship to politics, religion, love and art. The themes of politics and religion are followed up in chapter four, from which it emerges that Grass has intensified his commitment by limiting it to more tangible aspects of society. In chapter five Hundejahre is discussed as the last novel of a trilogy, The metamorphosis of the scarecrow and dog images is scrutinised, together with their cultural extensions in the figures of Weininger and Heidegger, and it is argued that the novel exhibits the first traces of Tendenz in its functional use of imagery. Die Plebejer proben den Aufstand is considered in chapter six as the turning point in Grass's oeuvre. The interpretation tries to show that, although deeply ambiguous, in the final analysis the tragedy is a literary equivalent of Grass's political position. This ambiguity and depth is lacking in ortlich betaubt and chapter seven posits that the novel is not so much an equivalent but more a literary version of Grass's election speeches. The final chapter reviews the political imagery in the whole of Grass's work, and interprets the titles as guidelines to Grass's evolution from Engagement to Tendenz. <p...|$|R
