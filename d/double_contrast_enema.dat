The large number of neoplastic polyps detected in this retrospective series emphasises the necessity for a careful radiographic technique combined with colonoscopy to disclose and treat these potentially malignant lesions of the colon. -Since 1954 radiography of the colon according to the double contrast-enema technique, known as the Malm 6 method,- 3 {{has been used in}} our depart-ment on almost 100 000 occasions. The value of the method in the detection of polypoid lesions is well documented. 4 13 The first flush of enthusiasm for colonoscopy in the examination of patients for polyps 14 - 21 now appears to be on the wane, 68 2224 though colon-oscopy is still regarded as indicated first in the investigation of idiopathic symptoms referable to the colon and for the screening of persons at high risk for carcinoma 6 25 26 or with potentially malignant lesions of the colon. The value of radiographic screening for colonic polyps has been seriously questioned by numerous gastroenterologists. In an endeavour to assess the relative diagnostic effectiveness of our routine double contrast radiography we compared the results obtained with this method with those obtained at colonoscopy, rectoscopy, and surgery.

Radiological imaging plays a fundamental role especially in evaluating such postoperative conditions as afferent and efferent loop syndromes. Radiology is thought to be essential to demonstrate the syndrome and to identify the mechanical/functional nature of the factors causing the disease, all of which are essential to an appropriate and safe therapy.

40|$|Colon and {{rectal cancer}} affects {{men and women}} equally. It is the third {{most common type of}} cancer in men, and the second most common type in women. Colon cancer usually affects people over the age of 40, with the {{majority}} of people who are diagnosed with the condition being over 60 years of age. Every year, 35 000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK. Colorectal cancer is conventionally diagnosed by colonoscopy or barium enema examination. Colonoscopy is described as the ‘gold standard’ test allowing visualisation and biopsy of a potential colorectal cancer. It is, however, an invasive procedure with a degree of discomfort to the patient and has associated complication and, albeit rare, mortality rates. Double contrast barium enema x-ray has less complication risk, but has a reduced sensitivity and specificity for detecting colorectal neoplasia (benign or malignant). <b>Double</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> can detect 70 - 80 % of pre-malignant colorectal polyps that are > 1 cm in diameter and a higher proportion of bowel cancers.

40|$|Background: Abdominal {{pain and}} {{bloating}} are frequent symptoms in SUDD, which are generally accepted {{to be related}} to functional disorders. Albeit no specific standard treatment for SUDD is accepted, guidelines of the American College of Gastroenterology suggest an high-fibre diet in patients with SUDD. Some observations suggest a possible role of gut microflora in determining symptoms related to SUDD, thus these patients may potentially benefit from probiotics treatment. Aim: to assess the efficacy of Lactobacillus paracasei F 19 in patients with SUDD. Materials and Methods: Multicentric randomized controlled study on 43 pts, aged 47 - 78 years (15 M, 28 F) with SUDD, diagnosed by <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> and biochemistry to exclude acute inflammation. SUDD was defined as: presence of abdominal symptoms (pain < 24 h and bloating) for at least 6 months before enrollment. All pts had a validated detailed questionnaire for abdominal symptoms and functional dyspepsia (FD) including a visual analogic scale (VAS). Exclusion criteria were: complicated diverticular disease, previous colon surgery, antibiotics or laxatives in the 30 days before enrollment, use of NSAIDs. In all pts a daily intake of 30 g of dietary fibre (vegetables and fruit) was recommended. Pts were randomly assigned to receive: 1 sachet b. i. d of L. paracasei F 19 (containing 12. 5 x 109 viable bacteria and 750 mg of gluco-oligosaccharides) for 14 days/ month for 6 months (Group A, n= 14), only fibre diet (Group B, n= 13) or 1 sachet once daily of L. paracasei F 19 for 14 days/month for 6 months (Group C, n= 16). Endpoint {{of the study was to}} evaluate the decrease of abdominal pain and bloating after 6 months of treatment by VAS. Results are expressed as mean±SD. Results: At baseline, 40 pts (93 %) had both abdominal pain and bloating, whereas 3 pts had only bloating. 34 patients (14 M, 20 F, 79 %) completed the study: 1 patient (Group A) was withdrawn for diarrhea and 8 patients (3 from Group A, 4 from Group B, 1 from Group C) were lost at follow-up.

SUDD was defined as: presence of abdominal symptoms (pain < 24 h and bloating) for at least 6 months before enrollment. All pts had a validated detailed questionnaire for abdominal symptoms and functional dyspep- sia (FD) including a visual analogic scale (VAS). Exclusion criteria: complicated diverticular disease, previous colon surgery, antibiotics or laxatives 30 days before enrollment, use of NSAIDs. In all pts a daily intake of 30 g dietary fibre was recommended.

A significant decrease of bloating VAS was observed in group A and C whereas of pain VAS in group C. Conclusions: Six-months treatment with L. paracasei F 19 significantly decreases the score of abdominal bloating in patients with SUDD. The higher dosage of probiotics is able to also reduce the score of abdominal pain. Thus, treatment with L. paracasei F 19 is more efficacious than dietary fibres in controlling abdominal symptoms in SUDD patients...|$|E

Subsequently 112 of the 160 patients were identified as having undergone DCBE, the results of which were analysed to determine its sensitivity for detecting colorectal carcinoma. Colorectal carcinoma was missed in 4 of the 112 barium enemas performed. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 96. 5 % with a false negative rate of 3. 5 %.

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} death and the third most common cancer in Canada. Evidence {{suggests}} that screening can reduce mortality rates and the cost effectiveness of a program compares favourably with initiatives for breast and cervical cancer. The objectives of the Association des gastro-entérologues du Québec Task Force were to determine the need for a policy on screening for colorectal cancer in Quebec, to evaluate the testing methods available and to propose {{one or more of these}} alternatives as part of a formal screening program, if indicated. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), endoscopy (including sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy), barium enema and virtual colonoscopy were considered. Although most clinical efficacy data are available for FOBT and sigmoidoscopy, there are limitations to programs based on these strategies. FOBT has a high false positive rate and a low detection yield, and even a combination of these strategies will miss 24 % of cancers.

40|$|Background Studies {{examining}} interventional screening have lacked accurate data, because {{costs of}} hospital infrastructure, nursing and disinfection {{have not been}} included. We compared all costs of different strategies for screening, including colonoscopy, to provide a rational basis for decisions in early diagnosis. The costs, although based on Australian data, are probably applicable to all developed countries. Methods Comprehensive cost data from Australian private day endoscopy centres, public and private hospitals, physicians, anaesthetists and pathologists {{were used to assess}} medical and infrastructure hospital costs for various methods of screening. The data were processed using the Office of Technology Assessment colorectal cancer screening model. Results Annual or triennial faecal occult blood tests (FOBT; HemoccultR) are cost-effective, particularly with assumed 10 -year dwell times (the time taken for an adenoma to become a cancer), the costs per year of life saved being $US 26 015 and $US 24 756, respectively. Colonoscopy at 5 - or 10 -year intervals is also cost-effective with similar dwell times, and colonoscopy every 10 years with a cost of $ 27 159 per year saved is comparable to annual or triennial FOBT. <b>Double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> at either 3 - or 5 -year intervals is cost-effective, but ideally should be combined with an annual FOBT, reducing the cost effectiveness of these options. FOBT also is ideally combined with flexible sigmoidoscopy; an annual FOBT and 5 -yearly flexible sigmoidoscopy is cost-effective with both 5 - and 10 -year dwell times, though less than FOBT or colonoscopy.

40|$|AbstractColorectal cancer (CRC) was the third-leading {{cause of}} cancer death in Taiwan in 2008. The {{natural history of}} CRC {{provides}} a chance for screening and prevention. Most CRC develops from adenomatous polyps. This progression takes at least 10 years in most people. About 90 % of CRC develops after 50 years of age. Screening tests can identify cancers, usually at an early stage, and polyps, which can be removed before malignant change. Removal of adenomatous polyps can reduce the risk of developing CRC by up to 90 %. Several factors increase the risk of CRC: a familial history of colon adenomas, CRC, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer; a personal history of treated CRC or adenoma, or ulcerative pancolitis for more than 10 years; old age; a diet high in fat and red meat and low in fiber; a sedentary lifestyle; and cigarette smoking. Colonoscopy is the best screening method, and detects most small polyps and almost all large polyps and cancers. Polyps can be removed during colonoscopy. The risk of serious bleeding or perforation is about 1 / 1000. In the future, computed tomography colonography may become a good screening tool. The <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> has largely been replaced by other screening methods. Combined screening with a fecal occult blood test and sigmoidoscopy is a possible option. People with an average risk of CRC should begin screening at 50 years of age. Colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years or computed tomography colonography, sigmoidoscopy, or a <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> every 5 years. Stool testing once per year is another alternative. Patients with an elevated risk should be screened with colonoscopy, usually beginning at 40 years of age. Screening for family members of those with familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer should be more intense and be initiated at 20 years of age. If polyps are found and removed during a screening colonoscopy, a surveillance colonoscopy should be done 1 - 5 years later, according to the size and histology of the removed adenoma...|$|R

One of the most important environmental risk factors for CRC is a Western-type diet, which is characterized by a low-fiber and high-fat content. Up to 25 % of patients with CRC have a family history for CRC, and a fraction of these patients are affected by hereditary syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner or Turcot syndromes, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The onset of CRC is triggered by a well-defined combination of genetic alterations, which form the bases of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence hypothesis and justify the set-up of CRC screening techniques. Several screening and diagnostic tests for CRC are illustrated, including rectosigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy (OC), <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> (DCBE), and computed tomography colonography (CTC). The strengths and weaknesses of each technique are discussed. Particular attention is paid to CTC, which has evolved from an experimental technique to an accurate and mature diagnostic approach, and gained wide acceptance and clinical validation for CRC screening. This success of CTC is due mainly to its ability to provide cross-sectional analytical images of the entire colon and secondarily detect extracolonic findings, with minimal invasiveness and lower cost than OC, and with greater detail and diagnostic accuracy than DCBE. Moreover, especially with the advent and widespread availability of modern multidetector CT scanners, excellent quality 2 D and 3 D reconstructions of the large bowel can be obtained routinely with a relatively low radiation dose. Computer-aided detection systems have also been developed to assist radiologists in reading CTC examinations, improving overall diagnostic accuracy and potentially speeding up the clinical workflow of CTC image interpretation.

Severe dysplasia and malignancy was seen most frequently in large adenomas (greater than 2 cm), and in those with a villous component. Laparotomy was avoided in 31 patients with proximal polyps, giving colonoscopy an added therapeutic and economic advantage over sigmoidoscopy and DCBE.

40|$|This study {{examines}} which methods are {{most appropriate for}} preparation of the large bowel for <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema.</b> Two proprietary laxatives, X-Prep and Picolax, mechanical colonic lavage, and dietary restriction were evaluated in a randomised study of 160 patients.

Scoring of the radiographs was carried out on a double blind basis. Picolax proved superior to X-Prep overall (p less than 0. 01) but this was almost entirely because of its greater effect in the right colon and transverse colon. Cleansing in the left colon and rectosigmoid was similar with both laxatives. Restriction of solid food improved bowel cleansing and gave better results than mechanical lavage. The addition of a colonic lavage in starved patients did not significantly {{improve the quality of}} bowel preparation with either laxative...|$|R
40|$|Although the <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> is the {{standard}} radiological examination of the colon, it is not universally available to patients referred by their general practitioners. A retrospective survey of all <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium enemas carried out over a two year period in one health district was undertaken to determine the diagnostic yield of pathological findings for patients referred by general practitioners and hospital outpatient departments and for patients who had rigid sigmoidoscopy prior to the enema {{and those who did}} not. A total of 530 patients were studied. The diagnostic yield for the hospital outpatients was 41. 6 % and in the general practitioner group 35. 6 %. In the patients who had rigid sigmoidoscopy the yield was 42. 7 % compared with 32. 6 % in those who had no prior sigmoidoscopy. It is concluded that the withdrawal of direct access for barium enemas to general practitioner patients in this district because of a low diagnostic yield cannot be justified. The lower diagnostic yield in the patients who did not have sigmoidoscopy supports the policy of requiring this examination prior to all barium enemas...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Ileocecal endometriosis is rare. Symptoms {{range from}} no symptoms, cramps, vomiting, to acute {{intestinal}} obstruction. Our {{objective was to}} review our cases, clarify, and resume its most appropriate management focusing on the factors to determine diagnosis. This is a retrospective study by revision of medical charts of all ileal endometriosis cases of our unit from 2006 to 2014. Case Report: Seven cases were found; three (43 %) had previous endometriosis laparoscopic diagnosis, four (57 %) had partial bowel obstruction episodes, three (43 %) had chronic pelvic pain, and one developed acute intestinal obstruction in postoperative ileostomy closure. In three (43 %), the diagnosis was made with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema,</b> in one (14 %) only with MRI, {{and the other three}} (43 %) during surgery. All patients underwent resection of the ileum and evolved favorably. Conclusion: Variability in symptoms hinders diagnosis. The gold standard for diagnosis is MRI, but clinical suspicion optimizes imaging test diagnosis. Segmental resection should be indicated in the majority of the cases...|$|R
40|$|Background/objective: Because of the {{inherent}} danger and associated discomfort of invasive procedures such as colonoscopy or <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> involving exposure to ra-diation, we studied the value of hydrocolonic sonography in the diagnosis of colorectal polyps in children with rectal bleeding. Patients and Methods: From March 2005 to January 2006, 46 children from 2. 5 - 11 years of age presented with hematochezia were examined by means of hydrocolonic sonography and colonoscopy. Results: On colonoscopy, 21 patients had normal results, 19 had polyps, 3 had proctitis, 2 had lymphonodular hyperplasia and 1 had anal fissure. Only 7 of 19 colorectal polyps were diagnosed by conventional abdominal sonography (37 %), whereas hydrocolonic sonography permitted the diagnosis of 17 (89. 5 %) with a specificity equal to 92. 5 %. In comparison with colonoscopy, positive predictive value of hydrocolonic sonography was 89. 4 % and negative predictive value was 92. 5 %. Conclusion: Hydrocolonic sonography is a accurate and safe approach to evaluating children with rectal bleeding. Thus, it {{can be regarded as}} an appropriate replacement of barium enema...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{presence}} of intestinal endometriosis cannot be reliably established by physical examination or the evaluation of intestinal symptoms, imaging techniques are required for the diagno- sis of bowel endometriosis. This review evaluates the techniques available for the diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis based on {{a search of the}} Medline database and Embase up to February 2010. Several studies have proved that radiological techniques (<b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema,</b> magnetic resonance imaging, and multidetector computerized tomography enteroclysis) are able to accurately diagnose intestinal endometriosis. Magnetic resonance imaging has the advantage of determining {{the presence}} of deep endometriotic lesions in other pelvic locations. Rectal endoscopic ultrasonography can precisely determine {{the presence of}} bowel endometriosis but its use is limited by the availability of the equipment required to carry out the exam. Over the last five years, several studies have proved that transvaginal ultrasonography is accurate in the diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis; in addition, this exam is well tolerated by patients and is inexpen- sive. Therefore, transvaginal ultrasonography should be the first-line investigation in patients with suspected intestinal endometriosis...|$|R
40|$|Occasional mitoses {{were seen}} in the stroma. Intestinal mucosa of the ileum and caecum showed a {{moderate}} chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. Ascending colon and appendix were microscopically normal. All the eleven lymph nodes showed features of reactive hyperplasia. Figure 1 - Histological section of the lesion in the ileo- caecal junction Discussion Bowel endometriosis is very rare. It is usually an incidental finding in the gut, but some examples present themselves as an obstructing tumefactive mass that closely simulates an intestinal neoplasm [2]. Although some women with bowel endometriosis may be asymptomatic, {{the majority of them}} develop a variety of gastrointestinal complaints. Except for rectal nodules bowel endometriosis cannot be diagnosed by physical examination. Therefore, imaging techniques such as <b>double</b> <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema,</b> transvaginal ultrasonography; rectal endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi slice computed tomography enterolysis should be used [3]. Medical management of bowel endometriosis is currently speculative. Several studies demonstrated an improvement in quality of life after surgical excision of the lesion. Bowel endometriotic nodules can be removed by various techniques; mucosal skinning, nodulectomy, full thickness disc-resection and segmental resection of the bowel [2]...|$|R
