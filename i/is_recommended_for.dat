5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> those {{at high risk}} from inherited genetics.|$|E
5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> {{builders}} 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others {{was to provide a}} lower cost entry point into the Modular Houses series.|$|E
50|$|A {{lower cut}} off of 90 cm has <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> South Asian and Chinese men, while a cut off of 85 cm has <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> Japanese men.|$|R
50|$|Other parameters, such as firmness, {{are more}} {{specific}} to the sleeper. In general, firm mattresses <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> stomach and some back sleepers, soft mattresses <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> side sleepers, and medium mattresses <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> the majority of back sleepers. Double mattresses are available with a softer and a firmer part, or with adjustable firmness levels, to accommodate sleepers with different preferences who share a bed.|$|R

[...] All adrenal masses should receive hormonal evaluation. Hormonal evaluation includes: ...|$|R
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Verses 10.19–23 advise {{that those}} who seek liberation in life or after death, should do yoga and reach the stage of Samadhi wherein one fixes one's mind on the supreme self. This <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> those in their {{advanced}} years and seekers of inner liberation and peace. Yajnavalkya suggests to Gargi that she should meditate on the self in her through yoga, and thus attain nirvana.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|R
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth <b>is</b> <b>recommended.</b> <b>For</b> {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|Fire Brigade (set number 10197), {{released}} in September 2009, {{was the fourth}} set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2231 pieces and <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.|$|E
5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.|$|E
50|$|A 1% {{procaine}} injection has <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> {{the treatment}} of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture (along with moist heat, steroids, and antibiotics). It has likewise <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10 ml of 1% procaine), as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm.|$|R

5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding <b>is</b> <b>recommended.</b> <b>For</b> more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
50|$|Fluoride mouth rinses <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> use in {{conjunction}} with other fluoride therapies, but is usually contraindicated for children under 6 years old as they may swallow the rinse and increase their risk of dental fluorosis.

5|$|The core {{gameplay}} of the Guitar Hero {{games is}} a rhythm game similar to Konami's Guitar Freaks {{and to a}} lesser extent Harmonix's previous music games such as Frequency and Amplitude. The guitar controller <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> play, although a standard console controller can be used instead. However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the {{manufacturing}} of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is Pantone 032. According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, {{but it must be}} in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes 915 by 1,370mm (approx. 36 by 54in), 1,220 by 1,830mm (approx. 48 by 72in), and 1,830 by 2,740mm (approx. 72 by 108in). The material that <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> the national flag is bunting wool.|$|E
5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for,</b> but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
50|$|There are few breeds {{of dairy}} cattle used for milk production. The {{selection}} of a cattle breed largely depends on the bio-climatic condition in the region. European breeds <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> upcountry wet and intermediate zones, while Indian breeds <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>for</b> low country dry and intermediate zones. There are also cross breeds for the low country wet zone.|$|R
