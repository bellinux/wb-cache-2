5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and family names were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end consumer.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The {{connection between the}} works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number}} of isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species.

5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of Roman {{influence on the}} Quantock region beyond isolated finds and hints of transient forts. A Roman port was at Combwich, {{and it is possible}} that a Roman road ran <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Quantocks, because the names Nether Stowey and Over Stowey come from the Old English stan wey, meaning stone way. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century, and eight miliarense and 671siliqua dating to 337–367AD. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The US-412 {{designation}} {{was applied}} to preexisting Oklahoma highways.

They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dealt with}} the Strand branch: it {{confirmed}} {{the layout of the}} junction between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L's) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station to the corner of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BS's Waterloo station which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP's platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls {{for use of}} the river was established by the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. <b>From</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E
5|$|The third Chinook carried {{half of the}} {{enhanced}} A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp.

The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.|$|E

5|$|A Roman {{detachment}} under John the Armenian {{pursued the}} fleeing Vandal king {{for five days}} and nights, and was almost upon {{him when he was}} killed in an accident. The Romans halted to mourn their leader, allowing Gelimer to escape, first to Hippo Regius and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Medeus on Mount Papua, on whose Moorish inhabitants he could rely. Belisarius sent 400 men under the Herul Pharas to blockade him there. Belisarius himself made for Hippo Regius, where the Vandals who had fled to various sanctuaries surrendered to the Roman general, who promised that they would be well treated and sent to Constantinople in spring. Belisarius was also fortunate in recovering the Vandal royal treasure, which had been loaded in a ship at Hippo. Bonifatius, Gelimer's secretary, was supposed to sail with it to Spain, where Gelimer too would later follow, but adverse winds kept the ship in harbour and in the end, Bonifatius handed it over to the Romans in exchange for his own safety (as well as a considerable share of the treasure, if Procopius is to be believed). Belisarius also began to extend his authority over the more distant provinces and outposts of the Vandal kingdom: Cyril was dispatched to Sardinia and Corsica with Tzazon's head as proof of his victory, John was sent to Caesarea on the coast of Mauretania Caesariensis, another John was sent to the twin fortresses of Septem and Gadira, which controlled the Straits of Gibraltar, and Apollinarius to take possession of the Balearic Islands. Aid was also sent to the provincials in Tripolitania, who had been subject to attacks by the local Moorish tribes. Belisarius also demanded the return of the port of Lilybaeum in western Sicily from the Ostrogoths, who had captured it during the war, as it too {{had been part of the}} Vandal kingdom. An exchange of letters followed between Justinian and the Ostrogoth court, through which Justinian was drawn into the intrigues of the latter, leading to the Roman invasion of Italy a year later.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
5|$|The River Don, which {{flows through}} Sheffield and Doncaster, had {{originally}} {{split into two}} channels below Stainforth, one of which emptied into the River Trent near Adlingfleet, close to its junction with the River Ouse, while the other headed north to join the River Aire near Rawcliffe. Following {{the work of the}} Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase, the Adlingfleet outlet was closed off, and the channel to the River Aire, passing through Newbridge, was improved to take all of the flow. The scheme was not entirely successful, and after severe flooding near Sykehouse, Fishlake and Snaith, accompanied by riots, a new channel was cut between Newbridge and the River Ouse near what became Goole. The old course of the Don gradually silted up. Navigation on the Don was improved by the construction of cuts and locks, with the lowest lock situated at Stainforth. <b>From</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ouse, boats used the Dutch River, Vermuyden's artificial drain, which was hazardous due to its fast flows, its tides and its shallowness at times.|$|E
