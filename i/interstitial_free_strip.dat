The main objective of this work is to investigate whether accumulative roll bonding (ARB) is an effective grain refinement technique for two engineering materials of pure copper and <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> (IF) steel <b>strips.</b> Additionally, the influence of severely {{plastic deformation}} imposed by ARB on the mechanical properties of these materials with different crystallographic structure is taken into account. For this purpose, a number of ARB processes were performed at elevated temperature on the materials with 50 % of plastic deformation in each rolling pass. Hardness of the samples was measured using microhardness tests. It was found that both the ultimate grain size achieved, {{and the degree of}} bonding depend on the number of rolling passes and the total plastic deformation. The rolling process was stopped in the 4 th cycle for copper and the 10 th cycle for IF steel, until cracking of the edges became pronounced.

40|$|The microstructures {{and textures}} of coarse grained cold rolled, {{partially}} recrystallized and fully recrystallized low carbon and <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steel were examined by optical microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The recrystallization textures of the two grades are markedly different, with the low carbon steel having a predominantly Goss { 11 O} texture and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steel having a / 1 ND texture with a strong {III } component. One {{possible explanation for the}} texture difference is that less severe localization of flow during deformation of <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels causes less Goss nuclei to be generated. While some support for this view is provided by the results presented in this paper, the results suggest that another mechanism may be at least partially responsible. Examination of micro shear bands on the surface of pre-polished samples showed that a higher proportion of micro shear bands remained active at high rolling reductions in the low carbon steel, compared with the <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> grade. Regions of Goss orientation within bands that have ceased to operate rotate to near-{ III } orientations with further deformation. Consequently, the recrystallization texture of coarse grained <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels can be rationalized by a reduction in the availability of Goss nuclei and an increase in the availability of {Ill } nuclei due to a "Goss to {Ill }" rotation within micro shear bands that have ceased to operate. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of microalloying {{elements such as}} Ti and Nb to increase the strength of deep drawing quality steels for automotive sheet products might affect the microstructure formed during the annealing after warm rolling in several ways. Firstly, the precipitates can exert a Zener's pinning on growing recrystallized grain, {{which leads to a}} sluggish recrystallization kinetics. Secondly, the amount of microalloying elements control the amount of C, N, S, and P in solid solution, which indirectly affects the recrystallization texture obtained after annealing. In this sense, the work carried out with three different <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> (IF) and <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> high-strength (IFHS) steel grades allows us to conclude that the increase of microalloying additions delays recrystallization kinetics. Moreover, the abrupt texture change observed between as-rolled and annealed material indicates that the nucleation mechanism for recrystallization is more related to classical nucleation at deformed grain boundaries than subgrain rotation (continuous nucleation). © 2010 The Japan Institute of Metals.

40|$|Abstract. Yield {{strength}} of ferritic steel increases with grain refinement {{standing on the}} Hall-Petch relation. In low carbon ferritic steels, the following relation is established between yield strength σy and grain size d: σy [MPa] = 100 + 600 /√d[µm]. The Hall-Petch coefficient of <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels is substantially small as 0. 15 MPa·√m {{but it can be}} greatly increased by the existence of small amount of solute carbon less than 60 ppm. As for the effect of substitutional elements such as Cr and P, some papers reports fairly large influence to the Hall-Petch coefficient of ferritic iron. However, the effect of small amount of carbon is sometime neglected or not cleared on the evaluation of Hall-Petch coefficient in ferritic steels. In order to evaluate the effect of substitutional elements, the research should be performed using <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels to eliminate the influence of solute carbon and nitrogen. In this paper, Hall-Petch relation was examined in iron, Fe-Cr alloys and Fe-P alloys with 0. 02 - 0. 05 mass % Ti and the following results were obtained: 1) The Hall-Petch coefficient of <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> iron is about 0. 15 MPa·√m. 2) Chromium does not give any influence to the Hall-Petch coefficient of ferritic iron, although the friction stress σ 0 is enhanced in proportional to chromium content (∆σ 0 [MPa]= 7 ×(mass%Cr)). 3) Phosphorus does not affect the Hall-Petch coefficient of ferritic iron or reduce it somewhat but increases markedly the friction stress σ 0 (∆σ 0 [MPa]= 250 ×(mass%P) 1 / 2). 4) Even under the co-existence of carbon with chromium and phosphorus, carbon dominantly works to increase the Hall-Petch coefficient of ferritic steels, but it is changeable due to the interaction between carbon and the other substitutional elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis is a {{study of}} the {{springback}} effect on two kinds of high strength steel, which are: dualphase and <b>interstitial</b> <b>free,</b> currently used as feedstock in the production of vehicles. The mechanical characterization of the springback effect was performed by means of a mechanical conformation test, called three-point air bending, performed by adapting it to the unconstrained cylindrical bending test.

Furthermore, it was performed a microstructural characterization of advanced steels by identifying and quantifying the present phases in coexistence by means of digital image processing. The results indicate that the springback effect in the dual-phase steel has the highest springback rates due to its high mechanical strength, and it causes a decrease in the aspect ratio of the grains that suffered mechanical conformation attempting to return it to its original form. On the other hand, the springback effect has the lowest rates, and the change in aspect ratio depends only on the <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steel elongation capacity due to its lower mechanical strength...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{material}} model {{considering the}} evolution of plastic anisotropy in <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels is validated for the forming process of the channel die, a complex part. In the model {{the evolution of}} the intra-granular microstructure is represented by tensor-valued internal variables. The model accounts for the cross hardening behavior observed in rheological tests of <b>interstitial</b> <b>free</b> steels. A novel cross hardening indicator which is directly derived from the constitutive model is proposed. This cross hardening indicator is a quantitative measure for the occurrence of cross hardening in the forming process of complex parts. A correlation between the occurrence of cross hardening and larger values of the stored (elastic) energy is observed. The influence of cross hardening on the forming process is investigated, in particular, the drawing forces and the geometric deviations due to springback. The influence of cross hardening on the forming process of the channel die geometry is small. The influence of cross hardening on the more complex S-Rail geometry is larger due to larger plastic deformation and more severe loading path changes. The concept of the proposed transient hardening indicator should be applicable to other models for the evolution of plastic anisotropy. A possible use of the cross hardening indicator would be the efficient choice of the material model in the context of sheet metal forming simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
