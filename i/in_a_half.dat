Its first location opened in Riyadh in December 1992, and expanded across the Middle East opening stores in the neighboring countries of Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Lebanon in 2001. By 2007, the company had grown to over 180 locations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dozen countries, all located in Southwest Asia, when it signed an additional franchise agreement to open locations in North Africa, with the first location in Cairo, Egypt.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E

5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
5|$|Grotrian-Steinweg's history {{dates back}} to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry Steinway after his {{emigration}} to the US where he founded Steinway & Sons). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory {{and the right to}} market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company {{to become one of the}} finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1958–59 NBA season, the Celtics got revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won another assists title and {{another pair of}} All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations. Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists {{in a game against}} the Minneapolis Lakers. While that record was broken 19 years later, Cousy also set a record for 19 assists <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> which has never been broken. The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and, behind Cousy's 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals.|$|E

5|$|San Antonio {{got off to}} a rocky {{start in}} their 2008–09 NBA season, losing the first three contests. In their fourth game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, however, Parker scored a career-high 55 points to lead the Spurs to their first victory of the campaign. The Spurs {{recovered}} soon enough, and approached the All-Star break ranked second in the Conference. With Parker averaging a career-high in points per game, he was named as a reserve for the 2009 All-Star game. The Spurs were without influential shooting guard Ginóbili for much for the season, and greater responsibility fell on Parker's shoulders. He helped lead the team to a 54–28 record and the third seed for the playoffs, In Game 4 of the first round against Dallas, Parker matched George Gervin's franchise playoff record for points <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> with 31. However, the Spurs eventually lost 4–1, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round {{for the first time since}} 2000. Parker's 28.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game broke his previous playoffs career-best averages of 22.4 points and 3.7 rebounds. On 13 May 2009, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2012, Duncan {{agreed to}} re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a {{supporting}} cast comprising Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal and Kawhi Leonard {{that had been}} maturing steadily {{over the last two}} seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the playoffs with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin's record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season. The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.|$|E
5|$|The high scoring game set several {{school and}} conference records: the 132-point {{combined}} score was the highest-scoring {{game of the}} year in major college football (so far), and the highest in both the 131-year history of Michigan football and {{in the history of the}} Big Ten. The Illini's 65 points were the most ever allowed by Michigan. They also established Michigan records for combined points <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> (62) and combined points in a quarter (49). Michigan's previous records in those categories were: 130 points (vs. West Virginia, 1904), 55 points (vs. Chicago, 1939) and 39 points (vs. Penn State, 2005), respectively. This game was the highest scoring FBS game since Navy and North Texas met on November 10, 2007, which Navy won 74–62. Robinson threw a career-high 305 yards, as well as a school record 262 yards in the first half. Michigan's 419 passing yards broke the previous single game record of 396 yards, which was set against Michigan State in 1999. Roy Roundtree had a school-record 246 yards receiving, breaking the previous mark of 197 yards by Jack Clancy. The two teams combined for a total of 1,237 yards of offense, breaking the record of 1,189 set against Northwestern in 2000. With the win, Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since Rich Rodriguez began his tenure as head coach.|$|E
