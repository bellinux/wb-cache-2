Because people are unaware of these psychological processes, they may mis-takenly expect intense states to last longer than mild ones.

In Study 2, participants predicted that their dislike for <b>a</b> trans-gressor who <b>hurt</b> them <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> would last longer than their dislike for <b>a</b> transgressor who <b>hurt</b> them <b>a</b> little, but precisely the op-posite was the case.
