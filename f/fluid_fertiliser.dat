40|$|Alkaline {{calcareous}} or sodic soils {{represent an}} important {{proportion of the}} world’s arable soils and are important for cereal production. For calcareous soils in general, despite high applications of P fertiliser for many years, P deficiency in cereals is common. Field experiments were conducted to test the relative ability of granular (e. g. DAP, MAP and TSP) and fluid fertilisers to supply P to wheat on grey calcareous and red brown calcareous sandy loam soils (Calcixerollic xerochrepts). A pot experiment was also conducted with these soils and with two noncalcareous alkaline soils to investigate the effects of placement on the efficiency of fertiliser performance. In 1998, fluid and granular sources of P, N and Zn were compared in the field by banding below the seed at sowing. In 1999, MAP applied as granular, and technical grade MAP applied as fluid, were compared as sources of P in rate response experiments. First year results showed that fluid sources of P, N and Zn produced significantly more grain than the granular product. In the following year, fluid fertilisers were found to produce significantly higher response curves for shoot dry weight, grain yield and P uptake in grain. At a commercial rate of 8 kg P ha− 1, <b>fluid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> produced between 22 % and 27 % more grain than the granular product. Soil moisture and fertiliser placement effects are implicated in the higher efficiency of fluid fertilisers. R. E. Holloway, I. Bertrand, A. J. Frischke, D. M. Brace, M. J. McLaughlin and W.

40|$|Rapid {{fixation}} {{of added}} phosphorus (P) into non-plant available forms means that P deficiency is commonly expressed in crop plants in Australia. Field trials {{conducted on the}} highly calcareous soils of Eyre Peninsula (South Australia) showed significant crop growth responses to fluid forms of P fertiliser, as compared to granular forms of P. A glasshouse trial was conducted to compare the responsiveness of wheat to fluid and granular forms of P fertilisers in 29 soils from southern Australia. Two <b>fluid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> (phosphoric acid and ammonium polyphosphate) were compared to a granular P fertiliser (triple superphosphate) applied at 12 kg P ha- 1. In 86 % of the soils tested wheat growth was P responsive, and in 62 % of these P responsive soils wheat dry matter was significantly greater when <b>fluid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> were used {{as compared to the}} granular form. These soils were characterised using several chemical analyses with the aim to identify soil characteristics that influence the responsiveness of wheat to <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Several traditional indicators used to predict P availability such as Colwell P, resin P and total P did not provide an indication of fertiliser type response. Soil calcium carbonate content had a dominant influence on the likelihood of differential responsiveness of a soil to <b>fluid</b> P <b>fertiliser</b> over granular. A bimodal relationship between plant responsiveness to <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and soil pH was observed where in acid and alkaline soils <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> outperformed granular products. Therefore, crop response to <b>fluid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> in various alkaline non-calcareous and acidic soil types requires further testing. Therese M. McBeath, Roger A. Armstrong, E. Lombi, M.

40|$|The grain yield {{benefits}} of applying micronutrient <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> over conventional granular products in calcareous sandy loam soils have been agronomically demonstrated. An {{understanding of the}} fundamental mechanisms and reactions occurring following application of these products to soils is critical to improve fertiliser management. We therefore examined the diffusion, solubility, and potential availability of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) from both granular and fluid forms of Mn and Zn fertiliser in an alkaline calcareous and alkaline non-calcareous soil using laboratory incubation experiments in conjunction with an isotopic dilution technique with ⁵⁴Mn and ⁶⁵Zn. Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> were observed in comparison to Mn or Zn from granular fertilisers in both soils after 5 weeks of incubation. Differential behaviour of <b>fluid</b> and granular <b>fertilisers</b> for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH. Most (~ 90 %) of the Mn in granular fertiliser dissolved and diffused out of the granule but was retained within 4 mm of the point of granular placement, whereas most (~ 85 %) of the Zn in the granular Zn fertiliser source remained in the granule. Our {{data suggest that the}} superior agronomic effectiveness of fluid Mn and Zn fertilisers observed in calcareous soils under field conditions may have resulted from the enhanced diffusion (Mn) and/or solubility/availability (Mn, Zn) of these micronutrients in soil when applied in fluid form.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we review 4 topics that were {{identified}} through extensive consultation with stakeholders as issues of high impact and influence for the grains industry: improving soil testing and interpretation; role of <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the Western Australian (WA) grains industry; using {{spatial and temporal}} information to improve crop nutrient management, particularly for nitrogen; and developing recommendations for managing emerging nutrient deficiencies. The key findings are summarised below. To further improve soil testing and interpretation, the review suggests that future research should focus on addressing soil sampling and interpretation questions, as they are important factors affecting the accuracy of fertiliser recommendations with changing cropping practices. There have been several studies to compare fluid with granular forms of P in WA, but the responses have not, so far, been consistent. More work {{may be needed to}} understand different crop response to <b>fluid</b> P <b>fertiliser</b> additions, particularly on low pH soils in WA. An understanding of the long-term performance of fluid P will also require an assessment of the residual value of fluid P compared with granular P under field conditions. Precision agriculture (PA) technology has potential to improve crop nutrient management and farm profitability in WA. The review indicates that understanding both spatial and temporal yield variation is critical for the successful adoption of PA technology by growers. The review also suggests that in WA, {{there is a need to}} explore the use of different layers of spatial information for determining management zones. In response to wide adoption of no-till and stubble retention cropping systems, increased use of <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> together with advanced application technologies, and increased interest in cropping in the high rainfall zone, there is need to better understand growers' practices and attitudes to crop nitrogen (N) management, and thus to better position research and extension activities. The review also suggests the need to evaluate new fertiliser products and site-specific N management concepts and develop N management practices for waterlogging-prone soils for improved N use efficiency in cereal production systems in WA. The negative balance of magnesium (Mg) observed in WA cropping systems, together with the information reviewed on factors affecting soil Mg content and crop response to Mg application across Australia, suggests that there is a need to evaluate the risk and impact of Mg deficiency on acidic sandy soils of WA...|$|R
40|$|Many {{agricultural}} soils worldwide {{in their natural}} state are deficient in phosphorus (P), {{and the production of}} healthy agricultural crops has required the regular addition of P fertilisers. In cropping systems, P accumulates almost predominantly in inorganic forms in soil, associated with aluminium, calcium and iron. In pasture soils, P accumulates in both inorganic and organic forms, but the chemical nature of much organic P is still unresolved. The P use efficiency (PUE) of fertilisers is generally low in the year of application, but residual effectiveness is important, highlighting the importance of soil P testing prior to fertiliser use. With increasing costs of P fertiliser, various technologies have been suggested to improve PUE, but few have provided solid field evidence for efficacy. <b>Fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> have been demonstrated under field conditions to increase PUE on highly calcareous soils. Slow release P products have been demonstrated to improve PUE in soils where leaching is important. Modification of soil chemistry around the <b>fertiliser</b> granule or <b>fluid</b> injection point also offers promise for increasing PUE, but is less well validated. Better placement of P, even into subsoils, also offers promise to increase PUE in both cropping and pasture systems. Mike J. McLaughlin, Therese M. McBeath, Ron Smernik, Sam P.

40|$|Polyphosphates {{have been}} shown to offer {{substantial}} agronomic benefits over traditional granular phosphorus (P) fertilisers in highly calcareous soils of southern Australia. With ongoing field investigations into the efficiency of polyphosphate <b>fertilisers</b> compared to <b>fluid</b> and granular orthophosphate (OP) fertiliser products, a need developed for detailed study of the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced efficiency of polyphosphate fertilisers in Australian soil types. Polyphosphates provide an analytical challenge as they contain chemically different forms of phosphate compared to most fertilisers, where P occurs entirely as OP. An investigation was conducted into the most suitable method for the speciation, quantification and separation of the P species supplied in polyphosphate fertilisers. While the conventionally used colorimetric technique was comparable to ion chromatography (IC) for quantification of OP, it did not provide the speciation and separation capabilities of IC. Polyphosphate fertilisers are thermodynamically unstable and hydrolyse to more simple forms of phosphate: this can be induced both chemically and biologically. A study was undertaken using IC to ascertain the effects of time, temperature and acidity on the stability of polyphosphate fertiliser formulations. All of these factors affected the stability of polyphosphate fertilisers and recommendations on storage of the product and mixtures with other <b>fluid</b> <b>fertilisers</b> can now be developed. Stability of PP in soils was assessed using solid-state speciation by solid-state ³¹P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Hydrolysis of both solution and solid-phase PP could be quantified using the NMR technique, and results using this method were compared to conventional techniques, which extract OP and PP into aqueous phases and use IC to assess the extent of PP hydrolysis. The concentrations of OP and PP determined by the extraction technique were lower than those determined by NMR, and consequently the proportion of undetected P was greater for IC than for NMR. There is disagreement in the literature as to the differences in partitioning behaviour (sorption/precipitation) of OP and PP in soil. A partitioning study was undertaken using the IC technique for aqueous P speciation. Retention of PP to soil solid phases was much stronger than OP, and addition of PP to soil resulted in greater concentrations of OP in the equilibrating solutions, indicating a possible competition for P sorption sites between PP and OP. A double labelling technique was developed where OP was labelled with ³³OP and PP was labelled with ³²PP. This technique was used to investigate the effects of time and concentration on the lability and partitioning of OP and PP in soils. Using this dual labeling technique it was possible to determine the hydrolysis of added PP, and to distinguish OP derived from hydrolysis of PP from native OP in soil. The dissolution of dissolved organic carbon, iron and aluminium and the sorption/precipitation of calcium as a result of addition of PP were assessed and related to changes in the lability of P supplied as PP and OP. This double labelling technique was further developed to assess the possibility of mobilisation of native OP by addition of PP to soil. The findings of this thesis indicate that the hydrolysis reaction is pivotal to the behaviour of the P species that constitute a polyphosphate fertiliser in soils. Investigations of isotopic exchangeability showed that while native P mobilisation was not detected, slow reactions of PP in soil including sorption, potentially desorption, and hydrolysis underpin the potential availability of PP in soil.
