40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a small open economy model {{to analyze the}} role of central bank liquidity management in implementing “unconventional” monetary policies within an inflation targeting framework. In particular, the paper explicitly models the facilities that the central bank uses to manage liquidity in the economy, which creates a role for the central bank balance sheet in equilibrium. This permits the analysis of two “unconventional” policies: sterilized exchange-rate interventions and expanding the list of <b>eligible</b> <b>collaterals</b> accepted at the liquidity facilities operated by the central bank. These policies have been recently implemented by several central banks: the former {{as a way to}} counteract persistent appreciations in the domestic currency, and the latter {{as a response to the}} recent global financial crisis in 2008. As a case study, the paper provides a detailed account of the Chilean experience with these alternative tools, as well as a quantitative evaluation of the effects of some of these policie...|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 2008, the Federal Reserve {{announced}} several {{actions to}} further increase liquidity, including {{an extension of}} the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, through January 30, 2009. On September 14, 2008, {{in the wake of the}} collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Federal Reserve announced plans to expand the <b>collateral</b> <b>eligible</b> at the PDCF to include all <b>collateral</b> <b>eligible</b> in tri-party repurchase agreements with the major clearing banks. Originally, only investment-grade debt securities were accepted as collateral through the PDCF. On December 2, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced a further extension of the PDCF through April 30, 2009.|$|R

50|$|Concurrent to the {{collapse}} of Bear Stearns, the Fed announced {{the creation of a new}} lending facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. The PDCF provided overnight cash loans to primary dealers against <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{collateral}} for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) {{also has}} been expanded; <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> will now include all investment-grade debt securities.

40|$|According to {{previous}} studies, the demand-liability feature of national bank notes did not present {{a problem for}} note-issuing banks because the nonbank public treated notes and other currency as perfect substitutes. However, that view, when combined with nonbindingness of the collateral restriction a against note issue, itself an implication {{of the fact that}} not all <b>eligible</b> co <b>collateral</b> was used as collateral, implies that the safe short-term interest rate is pegged at the tax rate on note circulation. Since evidence on short- term interest rates is inconsistent with such a peg, that view must be rejected. ...|$|R
40|$|Central bankers wish {{to ensure}} {{worldwide}} that large-value transfer systems, {{as a component}} of the key market infrastructure, exhibit sufficiently robust levels of operational resilience. We focus on the operational resilience of the Hungarian real time gross settlement system, known as VIBER. The goal of the research is the quantitative assessment of the ability of the system to withstand certain types of operational shocks. Systemically important participants are identified and it is argued that they overlap with endangered participants. An indicative list of participants who might be endangered by a liquidity shock is compiled by analysing proxies for liquidity risk. We shed light on the capacity of the system to function smoothly in the event of operational problems by simulating the technical default of one or two systemically important participants in VIBER. Altogether six plausible scenarios were formed, three entire-day incidents and three incidents involving less time (part-time incidents). The impact of behavioural reactions of technically non-defaulted participants and the application of existing backup procedures are also considered. The disturbance in the payment system was measured by the value of initially not submitted payments, the value of rejected payments, the total value of queued payments, the maximum queue value, the average queue length and the settlement delay. By means of gross and net liquidity deficit indicators, liquidity assistance required to settle all previously rejected transactions is calculated. By comparing the value of unsettled payments with the value of <b>eligible</b> <b>collaterals</b> in the banks' balance sheet, we can gain insight into whether the liquidity deficit can be financed through normal monetary policy operations...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the actual}} and {{authorized}} {{size of the}} Fed balance sheet (i.e., the amount it is allowed to borrow from the Treasury to lend) was increased significantly during the crisis. The money created was funneled through certain financial institutions, which use it to lend to corporations issuing the financial instruments that serve as collateral. The type or scope of assets <b>eligible</b> to be <b>collateral</b> for such loans has expanded throughout the crisis.|$|R
50|$|The {{actions of}} the Federal Reserve, {{including}} {{the creation of the}} Primary Dealer Credit Facility, have expanded its balance sheet from $800 billion, consisting mainly of safe treasury bills, to over $2 trillion, consisting largely of riskier debt and mortgage-backed securities. The decision to expand the <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> was criticized for further weakening the Fed's balance sheet. Also, the Fed's actions have been criticized as a power grab to become more powerful relative to other financial regulators such as the SEC and the FDIC.|$|E
50|$|If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or {{exceeds the}} Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must {{transfer}} <b>Eligible</b> <b>Collateral</b> with a Value at least {{equal to the}} Delivery Amount. The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party. The Credit Support Amount is the Secured Party's Exposure plus Pledgor's Independent Amounts minus Secured Party's Independent Amounts minus the Pledgor's Threshold. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which haircuts are applied. There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.|$|E
5000|$|The Term Auction Facility (TAF) is a {{temporary}} program managed by the United States Federal Reserve designed to [...] "address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets."

[...] <b>Eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> {{is the same as}} that accepted for discount window loans and includes a wide range of financial assets. [...] The program was instituted in December 2007 in response to problems associated with the subprime mortgage crisis and was motivated by a desire to address a widening spread between interest rates on overnight and term (longer than overnight) interbank lending, indicating a retreat from risk-taking by banks. [...] The action was in coordination with simultaneous and similar initiatives undertaken by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} collateralized money supply for short-run macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. We apply a simple sticky price model, where the central bank supplies money in exchange for securities that are discounted with the nominal interest rate. The central assumption is that only government bonds are <b>eligible</b> as <b>collateral.</b> If they are dominated in rate of return by private debt, there exists a liquidity premium and money injections {{are associated with a}} liquidity effect. When the central bank sets the nominal interest rate, the price level and the allocation are uniquely determined, regardless whether prices are perfectly flexible or not. Finally, we consider the case where the central bank sets the nominal interest rate in order to maximize social welfare in a discretionary way. Inflation is less volatile when money supply is unconstrained, while output fluctuations are smaller under a binding money market constraint. When households are very risk avers, social welfare can be raised by a collateralized money supply if the stock of eligible securities is constant...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} intraday {{interest}} rate in a CCP-based GC pooling repo market and its key determinants. Since collateral {{used in this}} market is identical to <b>collateral</b> <b>eligible</b> for the daylight overdraft facility of the Eurosystem, any intraday rate in this market cannot {{be a result of}} collateral constraints keeping banks from using the overdraft for arbitrage. Nevertheless, we find that in the crisis period a statistically and economically significant intraday spread (up to 60 basis points) prevailed that was only somewhat mitigated by the ECB's unconventional monetary policy measures. Our results show that this spread was mainly determined by the market liquidity of the repo market, suggesting that the intraday spread is largely a liquidity premium...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make a {{comparative}} analysis of modern gross and net payment systems, emphasizing the implications of the availability of intraday liquidity in the former, and of collateral requirements in the latter. In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: <b>eligible</b> as <b>collateral</b> and not <b>eligible,</b> with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions—which affects their return—and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a gross system, like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO 1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.

5000|$|When a draft {{promises}} immediate {{payment to}} the holder of the draft, {{it is called}} a sight draft. Cheques written on demand deposits are examples of sight drafts. When a draft promises a deferred payment to the holder of the draft, it is called a time draft. The date on which the payment is due is called the maturity date. In {{a case where the}} drawer and drawee of a time draft are distinct parties, the payee may submit the draft to the drawee for confirmation that the draft is a legitimate order and that the drawee will make payment on the specified date. Such confirmation is called an acceptance — the drawee accepts the order to pay as legitimate. The drawee stamps ACCEPTED on the draft and is thereafter obligated to make the specified payment when it is due. If the drawee is a bank, the acceptance is called a banker's acceptance.

50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|E
40|$|In our model, cross-currency basis, which {{captures the}} {{deviations}} from covered interest rate parity (CIP), reflects the relative {{value of the}} scarcer currency (US dollar) as collateral in funding constraints.

The report recommends a series of policy options, including some for consideration, directed at margining practices to dampen the build-up of leverage in good times and soften the systemic impact of the subsequent deleveraging. ...|$|R

40|$|Credit claims (or bank loans) {{represent}} {{a large share}} of the collateral accepted by the Eurosystem in its credit operations in recent years. Hence the techniques and procedures used in the use of credit claims as collateral have become significant elements of the monetary policy implementation mechanism in the euro area. The procedures involved in credit claim collateralisation, however, are generally more complex than those for marketable assets traded in regulated markets or in other markets accepted by the Eurosystem. While several types of credit claims are <b>eligible</b> as Eurosystem <b>collateral,</b> each type of credit claim has different characteristics which require specific considerations in the eligibility assessment. This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in the use of credit claims as collateral and relates these to some measures taken by both the public and the private sector aimed at facilitating their use in the euro area. The paper also elaborates on the syndicated loan market in the euro area as this market is sizeable, while it appears that the use of such loans as collateral remains limited...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are twofold: first, we attempt to express the {{threshold}} of a single “A” rating as issued by major international rating agencies in terms of annualised probabilities of default. We use data from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s publicly available rating histories to construct confidence intervals for the level of probability of default {{to be associated with}} the single “A” rating. The focus on the single “A” rating level is not accidental, as this is the credit quality level at which the Eurosystem considers financial assets to be <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> for its monetary policy operations. The second aim is to review various existing validation models for the probability of default which enable the analyst to check the ability of credit assessment systems to forecast future default events. Within this context the paper proposes a simple mechanism for the comparison of the performance of major rating agencies and that of other credit assessment systems, such as the internal ratings-based systems of commercial banks under the Basel II regime. This is done to provide a simple validation yardstick to help in the monitoring of the performance of the different credit assessment systems participating in the assessment of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> underlying Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Contrary to the widely used confidence interval approach, our proposal, based on an interpretation of p-values as frequencies, guarantees a convergence to an ex ante fixed probability of default (PD) value. Given the general characteristics of the problem considered, we consider this simple mechanism to also be applicable in other contexts. ...|$|E
40|$|Central banks play {{a pivotal}} role in well-functioning {{payments}} systems by providing liquidity via collateralized lending. This article discusses the role of collateral and haircut policy in central bank lending, as well as the distinguishing features of the central bank’s policy relative to private sector practices. It presents a model that explicitly incorporates the unique role of central banks in the payments system and argues that central banks must consider how their haircut policies affect the relative price and liquidity of assets, the market’s asset allocation, and the likelihood of participants to default. Furthermore, under extraordinary circumstances, there is a rationale for the central bank to temporarily reduce haircuts or broaden the list of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> to mitigate the shortage of liquidity in the market. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{central banking}} {{literature}} regards central bank independence and a transparent monetary policy as {{best suited to}} achieve and safeguard monetary stability. The existing empirical literature, however, failed in establishing a solid ground for this consensus. This paper sheds some {{new light on the}} empirical evidence on determinants of monetary stability. In addition, it expands the current research agenda by considering a neglected factor: The quality of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> (QEC). Recently, the U. S. subprime crisis has shown that a weak collateralization of credits may have massive economic implications, entailing severe perturbations of the international financial system. This paper focuses on central bank lending and investigates to what extent the quality of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> is able to explain inflation employing the first comprehensive dataset to assess the significance of QEC for monetary stability. Data have been collected using an online questionnaire that was answered by central bank officials. For the period 1990 to 2003 and a sample of 62 countries a robust negative and statistically significant correlation between QEC and average inflation is found. This result is robust to the use of control variables from the literature on institutional determinants of monetary stability. These findings have to be regarded as establishing QEC as one pivotal element of a theory of central banking. Collateralisation of the issuance of money and the elimination of financing the government deficit directly via the central bank can be seen as necessary conditions for achieving monetary stability. Good central bank money should be backed by the liable property of creditors to safeguard monetary stability. This finding can be utilized by policy makers especially in less developed and transition countries on their way towards a more stable economic development...|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an <b>eligible</b> asset as <b>collateral.</b> A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|R
