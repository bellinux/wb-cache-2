5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

He also garnered attention for what was perceived to be a fiery attitude, but took pride in coach Kapil Dev saying of him [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> player with such an attitude towards the game in my 20 years of international cricket".|$|E

I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> team that, as a whole, was so fast in the composite."

Three of the last inhabitants of a nearly abandoned underground fallout shelter—named Levi, Ruth, and Job—find a quaint old man collapsed in the snow outside the bunker. When they bring him down, they are surprised to hear the adults calling him [...] "Man of the Stars". The children grow quite interested about his strange nickname, as well as the fact that they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> visitor from the outside world. The old man recovers a bit and has the children help him in putting together a portable planetarium projector. This story offers an ultimate conclusion to the story in the kinetic novel.|$|E

500|$|The {{image of}} the Tramp has {{become a part of}} {{cultural}} history; according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown. The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "indelible" [...] nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his [...] "worldwide impact". Praising the character, Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most [...] "eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit" [...] in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.|$|E

He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, [...] "'I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don't believe there are any.'" [...] Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were [...] "'salesman for professional football [...] we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.'" ...|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E

500|$|From {{the late}} 1360s, Louis {{suffered}} from a skin disease with symptoms similar to leprosy. Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplation. After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: [...] "I call God as my witness that I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> monarch more majestic and more [...] or one who desires peace and calm as much as he." [...] He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states. Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1369. At their next meeting in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, Albert I of Bavaria, and Rupert I of the Palatinate joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs. However, Emperor Charles IV persuaded the two Wittelsbachs (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.|$|E
500|$|He reached 40 in as {{many minutes}} as Australia's total reached 50. Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney {{contributing}} 83 of those runs. Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131. By lunch, he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1/235, when he hit Macaulay to Patsy Hendren and was dismissed, having amassed 151 in 170 minutes. Former English captain Sir Pelham Warner said [...] "I say without hesitation that I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> greater innings... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely". [...] Macartney's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494. He then took 2/51, removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to follow on; however, the Australians could not dismiss the hosts {{for a second time}} and the match ended in a draw.|$|E

[...] He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter, and within days was urging {{that the use of}} ground troops not be ruled out. [...] McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict, and his [...] "We are in it, now we must win it" [...] stance drew much attention. [...] On March 31, three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia; the next day, McCain canceled his planned roadshow, stating [...] "this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign." [...] He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that, [...] "In thirty-five years in Washington, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I've seen this one dominated by John McCain." ...|$|E

You couldn't help it. You {{could not help but}} stand up. Even Prince Charles stood up." [...] It was Roger Moore's favourite Bond film, and many reviewers consider it the best installment to star the actor. Christopher Null praised the gadgets, particularly the Lotus Esprit car. James Berardinelli of Reelviews said that the film is [...] "suave and sophisticated", and Barbara Bach proves to be an ideal Bond girl – [...] "attractive, smart, sexy, and dangerous". Brian Webster stated the special effects were [...] "good for a 1979 [...] film", and Marvin Hamlisch's music, [...] "memorable". Danny Peary described The Spy Who Loved Me as [...] "exceptional... For once, the big budget was not wasted. Interestingly, while the sets and gimmicks were the most spectacular to date, Bond and the other characters are toned down (there's a minimum of slapstick humour) so that they are more realistic than in other Roger Moore films. Moore gives his best performance in the series... are an appealing couple, equal in every way. Film is a real treat – a well acted, smartly cast, sexy, visually impressive, lavishly produced, powerfully directed mix of a spy romance and a war-mission film." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times considered the film formulaic and [...] "half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion,... nevertheless the dullest sequence here" [...] but praised Moore's performance and the film's [...] "share of self-mockery", which she found refreshing.|$|E
500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> computer-animated feature {{with this sort of}} visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E
