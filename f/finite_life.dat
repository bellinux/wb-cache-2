500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} {{a tidal wave of}} new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans are picking up instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series.

6000|$|Sir Allan {{was himself}} {{dressed for the}} evening, with an orchid in his buttonhole, and a light {{overcoat}} on his arm. In the street, his night brougham, with its pair of great thoroughbred horses, stood waiting. Yet he made no movement toward it. He {{did not appear to}} be waiting for anyone, nor was he watching the brilliant throng passing westward. His eyes were fixed upon vacancy, and there was a certain steadfast, rapt look in them which altered his expression curiously. Sir Allan Beaumerville seldom used his powers of reflection save for practical purposes. Just then, however, he was departing from his usual custom. Strange ghosts of a strange past were flitting through his mind. Old passions, which had long lain undisturbed, were sweeping through him, old dreams were revived, old memories kindled once more smoldering fires, and aided at the resurrection of a former self. The cold man-of-the-world philosophy, which had ruled his life for many years, seemed suddenly conquered by this upheaval of a stormy past. Under the influence of the serene night, the starlit sky, and the force of these old memories, he seemed to realize more than he had ever done before the littleness of his life, its colorless egotism, the barrenness of its routine. Like a flash it stood glaringly out before him. Stripped of all its intellectual furbishing, the chill selfishness of the creed he had adopted struck home to his heart. A <b>finite</b> <b>life,</b> with a finite goal--annihilation! Had it really ever satisfied him? Could it satisfy anyone? A great weariness crept in upon him. Epicureanism could have been carried no further than he had carried it. He had steeped his senses in the most refined and voluptuous pleasures civilization had to offer him. Where was the afterglow? Was this all that remained? A palled appetite, a hungry heart, and a cold, chill despair! What comfort could his much-studied philosophy afford him? It had satisfied the brain; had it nothing to offer the heart? Something within him seemed to repeat the word with a grim echo. Nothing! nothing! nothing! ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{multiaxial fatigue}} loading in the high-cycle regime leads to {{localized}} mesoscopic plastic strain {{that occurs in}} some preferential directions of individual grains for most metallic materials. Crack initiation modeling is difficult in this fatigue regime because the scale where the mechanisms operate is not the engineering scale (macroscopic scale), and local plasticity and damage act simultaneously. This article describes a damage model based on the interaction between mesoplasticity and local damage for the infinite and the <b>finite</b> fatigue <b>life</b> regimes. Several salient effects are accounted for via a simple localization rule, which connects the macroscopic scale with the mesoscopic one, and by the model presented here, which describes the coupled effects of mesoplasticity and damage growth...|$|R

Our framework explicitly takes a component-based perspective. It allows the engineer to estimate a system’s energy consumption prior to deployment and refine it at runtime.
