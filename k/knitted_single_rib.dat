In this research work cotton yarns, produced from same cotton blend were spun according to compact and conventional ring spinning principles in three different counts. Three different <b>knitting</b> structures <b>single</b> jersey, <b>rib</b> and interlock were produced from these yarns. The physical properties of those fabrics were investigated and compared with each other before and after reactive dyeing processes. When the results were studied, it was observed that higher abrasion resistance and lower mass loss after 10, 000 cycles was found in all knitted fabrics made from compact yarn. Compact yarn based knitted fabrics showed higher seam stretchability and higher extension percentages compared to knitted fabrics made from conventional ring yarn.

40|$|Dolomites, {{northern}} Italy) is described. Dissimilites intermedius sp. nov. is {{an intermediate}} form between D. dissimilis and D. trinodosum. The new species combines the ribbing style of D. dissimilis (bifurcating with intercalating <b>single</b> <b>ribs)</b> with the tuberculation style of D. trinodosum (trituberculation on entire shell). The shallow-helical spire, entirely comprising <b>single</b> <b>ribs</b> intercalated by trituberculated main ribs, {{is similar to}} the one of the assumed ancestor Acrioceras, whereas the increasing curvation of the younger forms resembles similar patterns observed in the descendant Toxoc-eratoides. These characters support the hypothesis of a direct evolutionary lineage from Acrioceras via Dissimilites to Toxoceratoides. D. intermedius sp. nov. ranges from the upper Lower Barremian (Moutoniceras moutonianum Zone) to the lower Upper Barremian (Toxancyloceras vandenheckii Zone). The new species allows to better understand the evolu-tion of the genus Dissimilites. The genus appears within the Nicklesia pulchella Zone represented by D. duboise, which most likely evolved into D. dissimilis. In the Kotetishvilia compressissima Zone, two morphological forms developed: smaller forms very similar to Acrioceras and forms with very long shaft and juvenile spire like in D. intermedius sp. nov.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} a <b>single</b> <b>rib</b> on the local heat {{transfer}} around a bluff body are examined by using the steady state liquid crystal technique. By varying the spacing between the bluff body and the rib, the interaction between the rib and the bluff body can be controlled. The bluff body is oriented vertically towards the flow direction and spans the whole height of the channel. The bluff body has a rectangular cross-section (height b = 80 mm, width 40 mm) while the rib has a square cross-section (rib height e= 10 mm, rib width 10 mm). The rib is placed in the upstream region of the bluff body either by a spacing L = 100 and 50 mm to yield nondimensional spacing to rib height ratios L/e = 10 and 5 respectively. Here, the re-attachment length (x(R)) for a <b>single</b> <b>rib</b> is about 7. 5 e. The values of the Reynolds number based on the channel hydraulic diameter (D-h) are 55, 000 and 89, 000.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} two-dimensional numerical {{simulations of}} the flow and temperature fields inside smooth and ribbed bend (turn) parts of a U-duct with relevance for internal tip cooling of gas turbine blades. The ribs are placed internally on the outermost bend surface. The renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon turbulence model was used to solve the momentum and energy equations inside the bend (turn) part {{as well in the}} supply and return straight parts of the U-duct. For the ribbed surface three different rib configurations were simulated, namely (a) <b>single</b> <b>rib</b> at three different rib positions, i. e., inlet, middle and outlet, (b) two ribs for three different configurations, i. e., at the inlet and middle, at the middle and outlet {{as well as at the}} inlet and outlet, and (c) three ribs. The rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, e/Dh, was 0. 1, the pitch ratios were 13. 5 and 27 and the Reynolds number was 20000. The details of the duct geometry were as follows: the cross section area of the straight part was 50 x 50 mm 2, the inside length of the bend part was 240 mm. The results were compared with experimental data obtained at similar conditions. The numerical results were closer to the experimental ones for those cases with the rib at the inlet position than for the cases with the rib at the middle position. The case of two ribs at the inlet and middle gave the highest heat transfer coefficients while the case of a <b>single</b> <b>rib</b> at the middle gave the highest local pressure coefficient of all cases...|$|R

The comparison of the objectively and subjectively measured texture showed that the differences in texture due to yarn count variation are visually perceptible, as coarser yarns were found to contribute to smoother texture in both cases.

For this reason, three types of <b>knitted</b> fabric structures (<b>single</b> jersey, <b>Rib</b> 1 × 1, and full cardigan) with three different loop lengths and five different twists of ply yarn were produced.

Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and rubber threads serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for warp knitting. A crochet machine makes the warp and weft into warp knits with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting warp knits are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the warp <b>knits</b> with <b>single</b> 1 -ply weft (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm.
