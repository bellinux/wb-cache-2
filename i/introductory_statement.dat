The results also suggest changes in ECB communications occurred: using more <b>introductory</b> <b>statements</b> as reference texts improves the match between estimated positions and actual policy.

Trevor-Roper {{went on to say}} that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 1945. He finished his statement by saying that [...] "I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop." [...] The leading article in The Guardian described his public reversal as showing [...] "moral courage". Irving, who had been described in the <b>introductory</b> <b>statement</b> by Koch as a historian [...] "with no reputation to lose", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of Stern. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted [...] "Ink!

60|$|All honor, then, to the {{architect}} who has zealously vindicated {{the claim of}} internal ornamentation {{to be a part}} of {{the architect}}’s function, and has labored to rescue that form of art which is most closely connected with the sanctities and pleasures of our hearths from the hands of uncultured tradesmen. All the nation ought at present to know that this effort is peculiarly associated with the name of Mr. Owen Jones; and those who are most disposed to dispute with the architect about his coloring must at least recognize the high artistic principle which has directed his attention to colored ornamentation as a proper branch of architecture. One monument of his effort in this way is his “Grammar of Ornament,” of which a new and cheaper edition has just been issued. The one point in which it differs from the original and more expensive edition, viz., the reduction in the size of the pages (the amount of matter and number of plates are unaltered), is really an advantage; it is now a very manageable folio, and when the reader is in a lounging mood may be held easily on the knees. It is a magnificent book; and those who know no more of it than the title should be told that they will find in it a pictorial history of ornamental design, from its rudimentary condition as seen in the productions of savage tribes, through all the other great types of art—the Egyptian, Assyrian, ancient Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arabian, Moresque, Mohammedan-Persian, Indian, Celtic, Mediæval, Renaissance, Elizabethan, and Italian. The letter-press consists, first, of an <b>introductory</b> <b>statement</b> of fundamental principles of ornamentation—principles, says the author, which will be found to have been obeyed more or less instinctively by all nations in proportion as their art has been a genuine product of the national genius; and, secondly, of brief historical essays, some of them contributed by other eminent artists, presenting a commentary on each characteristic series of illustrations, with the useful appendage of bibliographical lists.|$|E

Disentangling the effects of ECB statements on prices, the real and the monetary sector, we provide evidence that especially the ECB's interpretation and forecasts of price developments represent important news to financial market agents...|$|R

Luckily Matthew is quite informative and open about the events occurring simultaneous to his writing, and that he found them to be of such considerable importance that not only did they distract his attention so he completely forgot about his book sitting with the printers, but they also had consequence for the relevancy of some of his ideas already committed to the page. In response to certain events, Matthew clearly added sections, marked by his <b>introductory</b> <b>statements,</b> such as, [...] "Since writing the above …", [...] "Since this volume went to press …", [...] "After the preceding parts of this volume had gone to press …", etc. This post hoc approach has created a distinctive halting flow and discontinuity between sections.

40|$|Botanical {{illustration}} combines {{scientific knowledge}} and artistic technique. However, whereas illustrated botanical images record static visual qualities, such as form and color, written botanical narratives supply crucial sensory, ecological, historical, and cultural contexts that complement visual representation. Understanding the text-image interface—where images and words intersect—contributes to humanities-based analyses of botanical illustration and illustrators. More specifically, a process philosophy perspective reveals {{the extent to}} which botanical representations engage the temporality, cyclicality, and contextuality of the living plants being illustrated. This article takes up these themes through a comparative theoretical study of three female Western Australian botanical illustrators, Georgiana Leake (1812 – 1869), Emily Pelloe (1877 – 1941), and Philippa Nikulinsky (born 1942), whose lives together span the 183 year history of the Swan River Colony and the state of Western Australia. I apply a processist framework to examine the text-image interface of their works. All three illustrators use some form of textuality: marginalia, annotations, written accompaniments, <b>introductory</b> <b>statements,</b> and other narrative materials. In examining their written commentaries and traces, I identify the emergence of a process mode of botanical illustration that represents plants as ecological, historical, cultural, and temporal organisms...|$|R

When a service experience is evaluated by airport visitors, their evaluation {{is influenced by}} their emotional reactions. Furthermore, since emotions represent a primary source of human motivation, positive emotions are {{likely to lead to}} positive responses, increased satisfaction and favourable behaviour. These <b>introductory</b> <b>statements</b> give rise to the aim of this article, which is to explore those service elements influencing visitors‟ emotions and, consequently, also their experiences at an international airport. In order to achieve the aim, a questionnaire survey (N= 490) was conducted at an international airport in South Africa after which a factor analysis was performed to identify the primary elements of the airport service environment that influence the emotions of visitors. Structural equation modelling was then employed to test the significance {{of the relationship between the}} service elements and the emotions of visitors. Five distinct service elements were identified, namely Physical comfort, Amenities, Visitor facilities, Passenger services and Accessibility. These elements further showed significant correlations with the emotions of visitors. This research was the first of its kind conducted at an international airport in South Africa and contributes significantly to management practices regarding specific elements of an international airport environment, i. e. the emotions, experiences and behaviour of international airport visitors.
