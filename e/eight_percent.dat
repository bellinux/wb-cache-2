5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even on both sides, the Austrians had {{a significantly}} larger fighting force, both on the field at Ostrach, and stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to <b>eight</b> <b>percent</b> of the force and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where {{a few days later}} the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and an Austrian victory.|$|E
30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{recovery}} factors of water and polymer flooding for cation and anion are nearly same, but the recovery factor of cationic gel particle is <b>eight</b> <b>percents</b> higher than anion after profile control displacement stage. The reason lies in the electrostatic adsorption reaction between the cationic gel particle and the anion residual polymer on the rock surface, which larges the grain diameter of cationic gel particle. Therefore, the blocking effect of cationic gel is better than anion gel particle.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the tenure}} of the Justice Party {{government}} of the Raja of Panagal is largely remembered for the introduction of caste-based reservations in 1921. In August 1921, the First communal Government Order (G.O. No.613) was passed. As per the order, 44 percent of jobs were reserved for non-Brahmins, 16 percent for Brahmins, 16 percent for Muslims, 16 percent for Anglo-Indians and Christians and <b>eight</b> <b>percent</b> for the Scheduled Castes.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to <b>eight</b> <b>percent.</b> Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E

Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance {{for the first half of}} the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.|$|E
5|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1942, Baćović and Jevđević held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac {{and agreed to}} recruit Muslims into the Chetnik ranks. Popovac's Muslim Chetnik militia later fought the Partisans during the Axis-led Case White {{offensive}} in early 1943, but did not distinguish itself. By December 1943, an estimated 4,000 (or <b>eight</b> <b>percent)</b> of Mihailović's Chetniks were Muslim. In November and December 1942, the Italians helped about 4,000 of Baćović's Chetniks in Herzegovina relocate to northern Dalmatia and Lika with another 4,000 to be relocated later. On 8 January, Baćović was conferred the title of vojvoda by the ailing Trifunović-Birčanin.|$|E
5|$|Since 1926, the University of Toronto {{has been}} a member of the Association of American Universities, a {{consortium}} of the leading North American research universities. The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada, with sponsored direct-cost expenditures of $878 million in 2010. The federal government was the largest source of funding, with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one-third of the research budget.

50|$|Oil {{production}} in the Gulf of Mexico was down by 24% percent and gas off by 8%, as several major companies (including BP and Shell) evacuated their installations {{in the eastern part}} of the basin. Overall, at least 39 (7 percent) of 596 production platforms and <b>eight</b> (11 <b>percent)</b> of 76 Gulf oil rigs were evacuated in the Gulf on August 26.

40|$|Feedback {{scheduling}} {{is a kind}} {{of process}} scheduling mechanism where process doesn’t come with any priority. According to the CPU burst needed by the process and the CPU burst remaining the processes are shifted between queues of the feedback scheduler to get completed. In multilevel feedback queue the total architecture is divided into multiple prioritised queues. In this paper, we give an approach for jobs which starve in the lower priority queue for long time to get CPU cycle. As a result response time of those starved processes decreases <b>eight</b> to ten <b>percent</b> and over all turn around time of the whole scheduling process decreases around <b>eight</b> to ten <b>percents.</b> In comparison to other types of MLFQs the performance of the proposed scheduling technique is better and practical according to the consequence...|$|R
5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, <b>eight</b> <b>percent</b> of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an <b>eight</b> <b>percent</b> increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan {{had ordered}} Burnside to make Roanoke Island his first target. Capture {{of the island}} would allow control of both Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, opening up a {{possible}} southern invasion route to Richmond. Coordinating with a naval flotilla commanded by Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Burnside launched an amphibious assault (one {{of the first of}} the Civil War) resulting in the Battle of Roanoke Island on February 7 and 8, 1862. After landing, the 21st spent a cold, wet night on picket duty. On February 8, it joined in the assault on the Confederate fort {{at the center of the}} island. Moving through swamps and knee-deep water, Reno's brigade, including the 21st, advanced around the Union left flank on the west side of the fort. After firing steadily on the fort for some time and taking moderate casualties, the 21st was ordered by Brig. Gen. Reno to storm the fort. According to the regimental historian, the 21st Massachusetts was the first regiment to mount the earthworks of the fort; however, the honor was also claimed by the 9th New York. The Union forces were victorious in capturing the Confederate fort on Roanoke Island and took approximately 2,500 Confederate soldiers prisoner. The 21st suffered 13 killed and 44 wounded, or <b>eight</b> <b>percent</b> casualties, during the engagement.|$|E
