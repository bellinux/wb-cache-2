40|$|Problem statement: WTO {{adopted a}} {{multilateral}} trading system without ignoring the importance of protecting environment. Exceptions in Article XX, Clause (b) and (g) checks trade {{at the cost of}} environment. It is difficult to establish a relationship between Trade Related Environmental Measures (TREMs) in Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. For the past ten years there have been simultaneous efforts to reconcile the differences between the two. Approach: Therefore, the author was intrigued by this topic and followed an analytical method of study with the help of various WTO documents available online as well as in books. Against this background, this article pursues three main goals to achieve. Firstly, it examines whether Public International law can be used in the WTO. In answering this question the author analyses the relationship between Trade Measures in MEA and WTO and how a meaningful balance can be struck between the two. The author has tried to find a solution to such conflicts in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Public International Law by applying the principle of lex specialis settles the conflict in favor of environment. Results: But somehow for years, WTO and its Dispute Settlement Body have been settling disputes between trade and environment in favor of trade. The second goal {{of this study is to}} determine whether sustainable development and its principles are intending to achieve a normative status in International law. In examining this issue it is pertinent to note that the International Case laws like the <b>Gabcikovo</b> <b>Nagymaros</b> Dispute becomes of utmost importance. The treaty laws also add to the presence of Sustainable Development. The author has also discussed the response of the WTO to sustainable development in the light of leading case laws. Conclusion: Towards the end the author has offered humble suggestions to reconcile the differences between TREMs in MEAs and WTO norms using sustainable development as an effective tool. The application of only the WTO law is not sufficient; it should also apply International law to the disputes. Such an approach would help in handling climatic changes and trade in genetically modified organisms...|$|E

50|$|The Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Dams (more {{precisely}} Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Waterworks, Bős-nagymarosi vízlépcső, Slovak: Sústava vodných diel <b>Gabčíkovo</b> - <b>Nagymaros)</b> {{is a large}} barrage {{project on}} the Danube. It was initiated by the Budapest Treaty of 16 September 1977 between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Republic of Hungary. The project aimed at preventing catastrophic floods, improving river navigability and producing clean electricity.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia had a {{substantial}} number of hydroelectric plants, located mainly on the Váh and Vltava rivers. Work was underway on a major hydroelectric power project on the Danube River at <b>Gabčíkovo</b> - <b>Nagymaros,</b> a controversial joint project with Hungary to which environmentalists, especially in Hungary, had objected. The completed project was expected to supply about 4% of Czechoslovak energy requirements. In 1986 the government approved plans for construction of several additional power stations on the Labe and Váh Rivers {{by the end of the}} century. Czechoslovakia imported some electricity every year from Romania.|$|R
50|$|Duna Kör (Danube Circle) is a Hungarian {{environmental}} organization founded in 1984 as a protest body {{to prevent the}} construction of the <b>Gabčíkovo</b> - <b>Nagymaros</b> Dams. Opponents of the dam argued that it would create an environmental disaster that would displace thousands of Hungarians from villages and towns where their families had lived for centuries. Opponents of the regime soon joined this burgeoning environmental protest and by the fall of 1988 the Danube Circle had about 10,000 core followers who actively demonstrated against the dam in the streets of Budapest. These actions mirrored protests earlier in the summer of 1988, in which more than 30,000 people marched in Budapest to express their anger over the Romanian government’s plan to bulldoze entire Hungarian villages in Transylvania. Hungary had not seen public protests on this scale since 1956.|$|R
5000|$|This {{involves}} Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and [...]was {{agreed on}} September 16, 1977 ("Budapest Treaty"). The treaty envisioned a cross-border barrage system between the towns <b>Gabčíkovo,</b> Czechoslovakia and <b>Nagymaros,</b> Hungary. After intensive campaign the project became widely hated {{as a symbol}} of the old communist regime. In 1989 Hungarian government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the International Court of Justice stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute is still not solved as of 2008.|$|R
50|$|His {{political}} career began as legal advisor for civil and environmental organisations {{in the late}} 1980s. As a founder of Danube Circle, {{he also had a}} significant role in environmental protection issues like preventing the construction of the <b>Gabčíkovo</b> - <b>Nagymaros</b> Dams which, according to the Danube Circle, would have damaged the habitat of a northern part of the Danube. He was {{one of the founders of}} the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1987, and represented that party in the Opposition Roundtable negotiations that played a very important part in Hungary's transition to parliamentary democracy. In 1989, for a short time he was member of the executive committee of the MDF.However, he left party politics in late 1989, as he was elected into the Constitutional Court of Hungary. He gained the presidency of the court half year later, and held that position until 1998. During this time, the Constitutional Court had a very important role in laying the groundwork for and strengthening democracy in Hungary. In this role, he significantly contributed to the removal of capital punishment, the protection of information rights, the freedom of opinion and of conscience, as well as the constitutional protection of domestic partnerships of homosexuals, which measures brought wide international acclaim for the Constitutional Court of Hungary.|$|R
50|$|The {{waterworks}} on the Danube {{were designed}} to have an additional level at Nagymaros, consisting of a reservoir 95 km long and the Nagymaros power plant. This level was to be located between the Hungarian towns of Visegrád and Nagymaros and its purpose was to use the gradient of the reservoir for production of electricity and also to allow ships to pass. The Gabčíkovo works were designed for control and peak running of the power plant, and the Nagymaros works as an equalising power plant to provide better conditions for shipping and to regulate peak outflow from <b>Gabčíkovo.</b> Because the <b>Nagymaros</b> works were not built, the Gabčíkovo power plant cannot work at peak efficiency, which causes appreciable economic damage.Non-existence of Nagymaros dam also causes main obstacle of inland navigation on the 2400 km Danube Pan-European corridor due to low levels of water. Hungary requests Slovakia to manage regulation works on problematic stretch of Danube {{that had to be}} solved by Nagymaros backwater. Transportation damages include also missing upgrade of river Váh waterway in Slovakia.|$|R
