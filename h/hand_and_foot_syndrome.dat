30|$|Tibial hemimelia is {{associated}} with several syndromes. Werner’s syndrome [25] is an autosomal dominant disorder that is currently {{thought to be a}} variant of triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS). Both diseases have been mapped to chromosome 7 q [26]. A deletion on chromosome 8 q, contiguous with Langer–Giedion syndrome, or type II tricho–rhino–phalangeal syndrome (TRPS II) may also be responsible for tibial hemimelia [27]. CHARGE syndrome, which is a pattern of congenital anomalies, including eye, nose, ear, heart, and genital defects, as well as tibial hemimelia [28, 29] is a mutation of the CHD 7 gene (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7), located on chromosome 8 q. CHD 7 is known to be expressed by the developing limb bud mesenchyme [30, 31]. Tibial hemimelia is also linked to tibial hemimelia–diplopodia syndrome [32], tibial hemimelia–split <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> [33] and tibial hemimelia–micromelia–trigonal brachycephaly syndrome [34]. The Gollop–Wolfgang complex is a very rare malformation characterized by ectrodactyly of the hand, ipsilateral bifurcation of the femur and tibial hemimelia [35]; both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been reported for this malformation [35].|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} the activity and toxicity of the XELBEVOCT regimen {{in patients with}} metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (WMD-NEN). Ancillary studies evaluated hypertension, proteinuria, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and the predictive role of serum vitamin D in progression-free survival and proteinuria onset. METHODS: This prospective phase 2 study included 45 patients with WMD-NEN arising from various primary sites. The treatment regimen was octreotide long-acting release (LAR), 20 mg monthly, metronomic capecitabine, 2000 mg/daily, and intravenous bevacizumab, 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, without interruption for 9 months. Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression. RESULTS: Partial response was obtained in 8 patients (17. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 6. 4 %- 28. 2 %); tumor response was more frequent in pancreatic than in non-pancreatic malignancies. The median PFS was 14. 9 months; median overall survival was not attained. Biochemical and symptomatic responses were observed in 52. 9 % and 82. 3 % of cases, respectively. The treatment was well tolerated. Grade 3 toxicities included <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> (11. 1 %), proteinuria (4. 4 %), and renal toxicity (2. 2 %). Proteinuria (all grades) was correlated with longer PFS (p[*]=[*] 0. 017). There was an inverse relationship between proteinuria and vitamin D levels. VEGF polymorphisms were not associated with patient outcome. CONCLUSION: The XELBEVOCT regimen is active and well tolerated in patients with metastatic WMD-NEN. Proteinuria correlated with hypovitaminosis D status and was the best predictive factor of treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} the maximum-tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, safety profile, and pharmacokinetics of the polyamine synthesis inhibitor SAM 486 A given in combination with 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin (5 -FU/LV) in cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with 5 -FU [bolus (400 mg/m(2)) followed by a 22 -h infusion (600 mg/m(2)) ] and LV (200 mg/m(2)) and escalating doses of SAM 486 A, 1 - 3 -h infusion daily for 3 days. Plasma sampling was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and 1 with pseudomyxoma peritonei were treated. Twenty-six patients received SAM 486 A in the combination at doses ranging from 25 to 150 mg/m(2) /day. Dose-limiting toxicity consisting of fatigue grade 3 was seen at 150 mg/m(2) /day. Other adverse events included neutropenia, <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome,</b> nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Fifteen of 26 patients evaluable for best response according to the Southwest Oncology Group criteria achieved a partial response [8 (30 %) of 26] or stable disease [9 (35 %) of 26]. SAM 486 A did not influence the pharmacokinetics of 5 -FU, and SAM 486 A clearance was similar to that when used as a single agent. CONCLUSIONS: The novel molecular agent SAM 486 A is tolerable and safe in combination with a standard 5 -FU regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The dose of SAM 486 A recommended for additional studies with this combination is 125 mg/m(2) /day. A disease-directed evaluation of SAM 486 A using this regimen is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reliable {{biomarkers}} of apatinib {{response in}} gastric cancer (GC) are lacking. We investigated {{the association between}} early presence of common adverse events (AEs) and clinical outcomes in metastatic GC patients. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data on 269 apatinib-treated GC patients in two clinical trials. AEs were assessed at baseline until 28  days after the last dose of apatinib. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without hypertension (HTN), proteinuria, or <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HFS) in the first 4  weeks. Time-to-event variables were assessed using Kaplan–Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Binary endpoints were assessed using logistic regression models. Landmark analyses were performed as sensitivity analyses. Predictive model was analyzed, and risk scores were calculated to predict overall survival. Results Presence of AEs in the first 4  weeks was associated with prolonged median overall survival (169 vs. 103  days, log-rank p =  0. 0039; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 64 – 0. 84, p =  0. 001), prolonged median progression-free survival (86. 5 vs. 62  days, log-rank p =  0. 0309; adjusted HR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 91, p =  0. 007), and increased disease control rate (54. 67 vs. 32. 77 %; adjusted odds ratio 2. 67, p <  0. 001). Results remained significant in landmark analyses.

40|$|Pain from bone metastases {{of breast}} cancer origin is treated with {{localized}} radiation. Modulating doses and schedules has shown little efficacy in improving results. Given the synergistic therapeutic effect reported for combined systemic chemotherapy with local radiation in anal, rectal, and head and neck malignancies, we sought to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combined capecitabine and radiation for palliation of pain due to bone metastases from breast cancer. Twenty-nine women with painful bone metastases from breast cancer were treated with external beam radiation in 10 fractions of 3 Gy, 5 fractions a week for 2 consecutive weeks. Oral capecitabine 700 mg/m(2) twice daily was administered throughout radiation therapy. Rates of complete response, defined as a score of 0 on a 10 -point pain scale and no increase in analgesic consumption, were 14 % at 1 week, 38 % at 2 weeks, 52 % at 4 weeks, 52 % at 8 weeks, and 48 % at 12 weeks. Corresponding rates of partial response, defined as a reduction of at least 2 points in pain score without an increase in analgesics consumption, were 31 %, 38 %, 28 %, 34 % and 38 %. The overall response rate (complete and partial) at 12 weeks was 86 %. Side effects were of mild intensity (grade I or II) and included nausea (38 % of patients), weakness (24 %), diarrhea (24 %), mucositis (10 %), and <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> (7 %).

Different histological subtypes have different clinical outcomes and show different responses to therapy. Overall, {{the incidence of}} kidney cancer has increased worldwide in the last years. Although {{the most common type}} of kidney cancer is localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a 5 -year survival rate of 85 %, about one third of patients present advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a 5 -year survival rate of only 10 %. Multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, sunitinib and sorafenib), the anti-VEGF MAB bevacizumab in association with interferon-α, and the mTOR inhibitors are now approved for the treatment of mRCC. Recently, the novel agents pazopanib and axitinib have also demonstrated efficacy in mRCC patients. Several recent retrospective and prospective trials have suggested that some of their adverse events, such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HFS) may act as potential biomarkers of response and efficacy of treatment. In this review, we analyzed the studies that have suggested a relationship between hypothyroidism onset and a better outcome of mRCC patients treated with TKIs. The biological mechanisms suggesting and explaining this correlation are not well known and different speculative theories have been considered in order to investigate the clinical link between hypothyroidism occurrence and the prolonged therapy with TKIs in solid tumors. Furthermore, the management of this unexplained side effect is very important to maximize the efficacy of therapy in mRCC patients because there is a clear and consistent relationship between drug dose and efficacy of treatment. Certainly, other studies are needed to clarify whether a better outcome is associated with hypothyroidism induced to TKIs in patients with mRCC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{combination}} of capecitabine and gemcitabine at Fixed Dose Rate (FDR) {{has been demonstrated}} to be well tolerated, with apparent efficacy in patients with advanced cancers. FDR gemcitabine infusion leads to enhanced intracellular accumulation of drug and possible augmented clinical effect. The goals of this phase I study were to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of chronomodulated capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer and to describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), the safety profile of this way of administration. Methods Patients with advanced solid tumours who had failed to response to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy was available were elegible for this study. Capecitabine was administered orally according to following schedule: 1 / 4 of dose at 8 : 00 a. m.; 1 / 4 of dose at 6 : 00 p. m. and 1 / 2 of dose at 11 : 00 p. m. each day for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7 -day rest period. Results All 27 patients enrolled onto the study were assessable for toxicity. The most common toxicities {{during the first two}} cycles of chemotherapy were fatigue, diarrhoea <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HFS). Only one out of the nine patients treated at capecitabine dose of 2, 750 mg/m 2 met protocol-specified DLT criteria (fatigue grade 4). However, at these doses the majority of cycles of therapy were delivered without dose reduction or delay. No other episodes of DLT were observed at the same dose steps and at the lower dose steps of capecitabine (1, 500 / 1, 750 / 2, 000 / 2, 250 / 2, 500 mg/m 2). The dose of 2, 750 mg/m 2 is recommended for further study. Tumor responses were observed in patients with metastatic breast and colorectal cancer. Conclusion High doses of chronomodulated capecitabine can be administered with acceptable toxicity. The evidence of antitumor activity deserves further investigation in phase II combination chemotherapy studies. </p...|$|R

When the blood cells become cresent/sickle shaped, {{they are unable to}} deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to other cells. The Sickle Cell Disease results in anemia (low blood counts), episodes of pain and increased susceptibility to infections. Objectives - The aims of present study to determine the most common tribes and regions in Sudan affected by the sickle cell disease, the effect of consanguinity in the appearance of the disease, at which age the symptoms start to appear, the most common symptom start to appear as a first presentation, the most common presentations of sickle cell disease. To identify the precipitating factors of clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. To determine rate of appearance of symptoms per year, if the socei-economical status can affect on the disease. the frequency of of hospitalization. To assess the effect of regular follow up on the rate of hospitalization and to identify the percentage of the patients whom are received folic acid,antibiotics prophylaxis and vaccination against bacterial infections. Methods - Descriptive, cross sectional, community based study. The study time interval was during August and September 2008. The data was collected by questionnaire giving information on patients have sickle cell disease confirmed by laboratory diagnosis; interview with questionnaire was made with 117 patients or their parents in case in younger children, and analyzed by using SPSS version 16. Results - The study revealed that The most tribes are affected by sickle cell disease are those occupied the west part of sudan; most common ones are mesaria (17 %),rezagat (10 %) and zagawa (9 %). the disease occur commonly in children whose parents are cousins (69. 2 %).

40|$|Although the anti-neoplastic {{activity}} of 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) is improved by continuous infusion or biochemical modulation, {{the need for}} in-dwelling central venous catheters and toxicity {{have proved to be}} major impediments. Capecitabine (Xeloda, N 4 -pentyloxycarbonyl- 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fluoro-cytidine), an oral fluoropyrimidine, has been synthesized in the laboratory as an inactive precursor that passes intact through the intestinal mucosa and is sequentially converted to 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fluorocytidine (5 '-DFCR), 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine (5 '-DFUR) and finally 5 -FU in the liver and tumour tissues selectively. Preclinical studies provided evidence of preferential conversion of inactive 5 '-DFUR to active 5 -FU in solid tumours due to the relative overexpression of the final anabolising enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (TP), in neoplastic tissues more than in normal counterparts. Phase I/II studies exploring toxicity and the appropriate dosing resulted in the evaluation of the intermittent schedule (2510 mg/m 2 /day for 14 days every 3 weeks) in subsequent trials. Two large phase III studies in patients with metastatic colon cancer established at least equivalent efficacy and improved tolerability for capecitabine compared to the Mayo Clinic bolus 5 -FU/folinic acid regimen. Phase II studies established remarkable activity in women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Moreover the combination with a taxane yielded a unique survival benefit compared to the previous gold standard of taxane monotherapy in a phase III trial of women with anthracycline resistant breast cancer. The commonest side-effects are <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome,</b> diarrhoea and stomatitis with serious adverse events occurring in a minority of patients. Myelosuppression was minimal or absent. Toxic manifestations are easily managed with a significant reduction in the frequency of hospitalizations and medical resource use, as shown in appropriate studies. Capecitabine is expected to find a role in the treatment of other tumour types as well as adjuvant administration. It represents an advance in modern drug development, stressing the current shift towards rational development of new agents and home-based outpatient regimens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) mutational {{status is}} {{recognized}} factor {{related to the}} results of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy such as imatinib (IM) or sunitinib (SU). Arterial hypertension (AH) is common adverse event related to SU, reported as predictive factor in renal cell carcinoma. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the outcomes and factors predicting results of SU therapy in inoperable/metastatic CD 117 (+) GIST patients after IM failure. Methods We identified 137 consecutive patients with advanced inoperable/metastatic GIST treated in one center with SU (2 nd line treatment). Median follow-up time was 23 months. Additionally, in 39 patients there were analyzed selected constitutive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA and VEGFR 2 genes. Results One year progression-free survival (PFS; calculated from the start of SU) rate was 42 % and median PFS was 43 weeks. The estimated overall survival (OS, calculated both from start of SU or IM) was 74 weeks and 51 months, respectively. One-year PFS was 65 % (median 74 weeks) in 55 patients with AH vs. 22 % (median 17 weeks) in patients without AH. Patients with primary tumors carrying mutations in KIT exon 9 or wild-type had substantially better 1 -year PFS (68 % and 57 %; median 65. 5 and 50. 5 weeks, respectively) than patients having tumors with KIT exon 11 or PDGFRA mutations (34 % and 15 %; median 36. 8 and 9 weeks, respectively). We identified two independent factors with significant impact on PFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analysis: primary tumor genotype and presence of AH. The most common adverse events during therapy were: fatigue, AH, hypothyroidism, <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>syndrome,</b> mucositis, skin reactions, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. Two deaths were assessed as related to tumor rupture caused by reaction to SU therapy. The presence of C-allele in rs 833061 and the T-allele in rs 3025039 polymorphism of VEGFA were associated with significantly higher risk of hypothyroidism (OR: 10. 0 p = 0. 041 and OR: 10. 5; p = 0. 015, respectively). Conclusions We confirmed that many advanced GIST patients benefit from SU therapy with OS > 1. 5 year. Primary tumor KIT/PDGFRA genotype and SU-induced AH, as surrogate of its antiangiogenic activity are two independent factors influencing both PFS and OS.

40|$|Abstract = Thirty {{patients}} with <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> eczema were evaluated with special refer-ence to relationship with atopic dermatitis.
