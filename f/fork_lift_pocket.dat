50|$|Assembly {{lines are}} {{designed}} for the sequential organization of workers, tools or machines, and parts. The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as <b>fork</b> <b>lifts,</b> or gravity, with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead cranes or <b>fork</b> <b>lifts.</b> Each worker typically performs one simple operation.|$|R

50|$|Both dock {{plates and}} dock boards have a diamond pattern {{embossed}} onto their upper surfaces, to prevent wheel slip as carts and vehicles travel {{up and down}} the incline. Similarly, they both have locking T-bar legs that extend down into the gap between truck and dock, to secure them. They are both portable. But dock boards are heavier than dock plates. The latter may be carried by hand, and are generally fitted with handles for doing so. The former usually require a <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> in order to place and remove them, and are generally fitted with either loops or chains, used for attaching the dock board to the forks of the <b>fork</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
