5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and <b>intoxication</b> {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug <b>intoxication</b> (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and <b>intoxication</b> can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E
5|$|This {{alphabetical}} list contains notable {{people whose}} deaths can be reliably sourced {{to be the}} result of drug overdose or acute drug <b>intoxication.</b> Where sources indicate drug overdose or <b>intoxication</b> was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will specified in the 'notes' column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as 'suicide', 'accidental', 'undetermined', or otherwise in the 'cause' column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as 'unknown'. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused by drug overdoses or <b>intoxication</b> are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and cirrhosis from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from lethal injection or euthanasia.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficult}} {{transitional period}} {{to a market}} economy gives its reflection on the number of the acute <b>intoxications.</b> They {{can be used as a}} social barometer of the politico-economic changes in our country. During the last 15 years a steady tendency has been outlined in the dynamics of part of the acute <b>intoxications</b> expressed with minor deviations in the frequency. On the other side, the climate-related <b>intoxications</b> like mycetism or <b>intoxications</b> related to some stages of social development marked by “fashion trends” as use of narcotic substances and psychostimulants show significant differences. PURPOSE: Epidemiology research of acute exogenous <b>intoxications</b> during a period of 15 years in Varna and Varna district. Tasks: 1.

40|$|Objective: To {{collect data}} of {{toxicological}} cases for a 10 -year period {{and to develop}} a database for comparing epidemiology of <b>intoxications</b> with data from the national poisoning information centre (NVIC) and national prescription data (GIP). Design: Retrospective database study. Methods: All drug <b>intoxications</b> between 1997 and 2006 were identified from the records of the Clinical Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Laboratory in The Hague, Netherlands. Patient demographics and details of drugs analysed were acquired. These data were compared with data from NVIC and GIP. Results and conclusion: Almost 6000 cases were reviewed. From 1997 to 2006 the number of toxicological cases in The Hague increased from 322 to 826 per year. From 2001 - 2005 > 90 % of toxicological cases comprised analgesics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and hypnotics. These drugs comprised 60 - 70 % of cases reported to the PIC and 10 - 12 % of prescriptions. Most drug <b>intoxications</b> in The Hague involved analgesics and psychopharmacologic drugs. Relative to prescription data, most <b>intoxications</b> occur with tricyclic antidepressants. There seems to be an imbalance between number of <b>intoxications</b> and prescriptions among SSRIs: citalopram is relatively more involved in <b>intoxications</b> than the other SSRIs, but {{more research is needed to}} confirm this...|$|R

Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to <b>intoxication</b> and the <b>intoxication</b> itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide the {{critical}} care clinician with a comprehensive review of the indications for extracorporeal elimination of toxic substances, to summarize the different techniques and the <b>intoxications</b> for which these techniques are suitable. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last year, several excellent reviews about toxicological topics have been published. These reviews focused on <b>intoxications</b> in children, the approach of the patient with an unknown overdose, management of <b>intoxications</b> with salicylates, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists and liver support systems. Important developments include the use of high-flux, high-efficiency membranes and albumin dialysis using the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). This system offers possibilities for the removal of protein-bound substances such as diltiazem, phenytoin and theophylline. SUMMARY: Although large randomized controlled trials are scarce in the field of toxicology, the treatment of <b>intoxications</b> is becoming more and more evidence based. This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations concerning the extracorporeal treatment of <b>intoxications</b> and discusses new developments in the field, such as the use of high-flux, high-efficiency membranes and albumin dialysi...|$|R
30|$|Results: In total, 135 {{case reports}} {{received}} grade 1 – 4 and 34 grade 5. Forty of the 135 case reports that had reported {{a positive effect}} of ILE were parenteral <b>intoxications</b> while 95 were oral poisonings. Three of 135 cases were classified as a certain correlation between giving ILE and improvement of symptoms, 34 cases as probable correlation, 71 possible and 27 unlikely. Mean classification grade in parenteral <b>intoxications</b> was 2.3. Mean classification grade among the oral poisonings was 3.1, which was a highly significant difference. None of the oral poisonings received the classification grade 'certain'. The parenteral <b>intoxications</b> had a mean log p-value of 4.2 which {{was significantly higher than}} that for oral poisonings which was 3.2. Indications for ILE in parenteral <b>intoxications</b> were cardiac arrest and neurological symptoms and for oral poisonings hypotension and arrhythmia.|$|R

In children, accidental <b>intoxications</b> with {{household products}} are most frequent. In these cases special emphasis must be put on preventive measures.

Methods Population based, cross-sectional survey addressing all adolescents aged 13 – 19 years, attending secondary or high school in North – Trøndelag County, Norway. 8983 youths (91 %) answered the Young-HUNT questionnaire in the 1995 – 1997 survey. Logistic regression models were used to study associations. Results 80 % of the respondents reported that they had tried drinking alcohol, and 57 % had been intoxicated at least once. The proportion of the students, which had tried alcohol, was equal in both genders and increased with age. Attention problems and conduct problems were strongly associated with frequent alcohol <b>intoxications</b> in both genders. Anxiety and depressive symptoms among girls were also related to high numbers of <b>intoxications</b> Conclusion Gender differences in number of alcohol <b>intoxications</b> were small. There was a close association between both conduct and attention problems and high alcohol consumption in both genders.
